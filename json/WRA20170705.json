Progress can also be seen in our improved international rankings.  For example, Ireland ranks 6th in the IMD World Competitiveness Rankings.  This compares to a ranking of 24th at the height of the crisis in 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The restoration of Irish competitiveness since 2008 has been hard-won through productivity improvements and\u00a0wage and price moderation. It is important that this competitiveness is\u00a0preserved and continues to support growth.\u00a0 This is all the more important given the heightened international uncertainty at present.  We must ensure that the economy is best placed to weather economic shocks to the greatest extent possible.  Competitiveness is an important factor in this.<\/p>  <p>  We must also be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements can reverse, as we have seen for example in the strengthening of the euro against sterling.  Similarly, gains from the fall in oil prices\u00a0may unwind in the future.  In terms of domestic risks to competitiveness, housing supply pressures are of concern.  The housing sector can adversely impact on competitiveness through for example, restricting the mobility of labour.<\/p>  <p>  These risks highlight the importance of maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies, including sustainable fiscal policies, to help address emerging uncertainties.  It is also important that at firm level, pay moves in line with productivity developments. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, competitiveness has improved but we must not be complacent.

Through this initiative, NAMA has facilitated the sale or lease by its debtors and receivers of properties on commercial terms, to public bodies for a wide-range of purposes, including social housing; schools; healthcare facilities; and urban economic, environmental and cultural regeneration. \u00a0All such transactions are executed at market value. <\/p><p>NAMA has also established National Asset Residential Property Services (&ldquo;NARPS&rdquo;) as an innovative model to expedite social housing delivery.\u00a0 NARPS purchases\u00a0properties directly from\u00a0NAMA debtors and\u00a0receivers, at market value.\u00a0 NARPS then onward leases these properties to local authorities and approved housing bodies on long term\u00a0(20 year 9 months) leases,\u00a0which include an option for the local authorities or approved housing bodies to purchase the unit at market value towards the end of the lease term. \u00a0NARPS has been in operation since 2013 and has purchased over 1,300 units from NAMA debtors and receivers, all of which have been leased for social housing. \u00a0The establishment of NARPS has ensured the transfer of fully-furnished and compliant properties for immediate occupation by social housing tenants in a timely manner while also remaining faithful to NAMA&rsquo;s commercial mandate.<\/p><p>NAMA is also seeking to facilitate the delivery of 20,000 homes over the period from 2016 to 2020, subject to commercial viability.\u00a0 Since 2014, NAMA has funded the construction of over 4,800 new residential units in Ireland on residential development land securing its loan portfolio.<\/p><p>NAMA also played a key role in the resolution of unfinished housing estates within the State.\u00a0 In 2010 NAMA had exposure to 332 unfinished housing estates. That has now reduced to 11 unfinished estates at this stage and all of NAMA's remaining exposure to such sites are expected to be resolved by end-2017.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Ultimately, NAMA&rsquo;s principal contribution to social and economic development of the State has been the major progress that it has made in eliminating Irish taxpayers' contingent liability of &euro;30 billion which arose from the Government Guaranteed senior debt issued in order to acquire bank loan portfolios.\u00a0 As of today, 98% of that senior debt has been redeemed and NAMA has indicated that it expects the residual &euro;500m to be redeemed by the end of this year.\u00a0 NAMA also expects to redeem its subordinated debt by March 2020 and to produce a surplus &ndash; currently estimated at &euro;3 billion &ndash; by the time it completes its work. <\/p><p>Finally,\u00a0 the long-term solution to the current homelessness issue is to increase the\u00a0supply\u00a0of homes and the Government is determined to see increases in the supply of\u00a0high quality social and affordable homes, to buy or rent, as quickly as possible, particularly in the major urban areas where demand is greatest.  This is one of the issues\u00a0the Minister for\u00a0Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will be considering in the context of the recently announced\u00a0review of\u00a0Rebuilding Ireland,\u00a0one year\u00a0on from its\u00a0publication, with an emphasis on building on the progress made,\u00a0strengthening the measures already in place and identifying new initiatives that add value and raise ambition. \u00a0In this context, the fourth edition of\u00a0Rebuilding Ireland's\u00a0Monthly Housing Activity Report shows that housing construction activity continues to gather momentum, with an appreciable rise in the level of housing commencements notified to local authorities during March 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500076#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2018","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500076#WRB02200"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[31480\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500076#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has considered the impact that potential income tax cuts will have on the ability to invest in vital public services in budget 2018; his views on the further erosion of the tax base; the way in which he plans to offset the potential exchequer losses from a proposed tax cut; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>The Programme for Partnership Government recognises the need to invest in public services and capital infrastructure to meet increasing demographic demands; to provide targeted expenditure increases for improvements focusing upon health, housing, education, disability, child care and development.  It also recognises that capital investment in key physical and social infrastructure can support growth and continued job creation.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The programme therefore contains a commitment that budget measures will be introduced that will involve at least a 2:1 split between public spending and tax reductions.  This commitment is also contained in the Confidence and Supply agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il. The ratio of spending increases to tax reductions in Budget 2017 exceeded this target and was in fact over 3:1 in favour of expenditure.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The income tax base was broadened significantly in the crisis through the introduction of the broad-based USC but also through the curtailment or abolition of a range of income tax reliefs.  In 2010 over 45% of income earners were exempt from income tax.  At present it is estimated that circa 30% of income earners are exempt from USC with approximately 37% of earners exempt from Income Tax. <\/p>  <p>  While the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the breadth of the tax base, it also recognises that high personal tax rates in Ireland discourage work and jobs and have a negative impact on our international competitiveness.  Therefore, it contains a commitment for a medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, while reducing excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limiting the benefit for high earners.  We must appreciate the value of retaining the incentive to work, to enable those who work hard to provide for their families and generate further economic growth through employment and expenditure in the domestic economy.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, changes to one particular tax, such as income tax, are not considered in isolation.  They must be considered as part of the overall Budget process encompassing both revenue and expenditure measures and in the context of available resources.

For a more meaningful assessment of trends in public debt in Ireland, therefore, it is important to look beyond this simple measure. <\/p>  <p>  Other debt sustainability measures such as the debt-to-revenue ratio and the interest-to-revenue ratio are also improving.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Our economy is growing strongly; our public finance deficit is declining, as are our debt service costs and we are now running a primary budget surplus. All of this is positive from a debt sustainability perspective.  In addition, the proceeds from the recent sale of part of the Government&rsquo;s share-holding in AIB will reduce the overall level of public debt. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, the best and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts is to continue to prudently manage the public finances.  As we cannot control the international environment, we will need to continue to improve our competitiveness, including by focussing on costs we can control, by boosting our productivity, and ensuring sustainable public finances.<\/p>  <p>  It should be recognised that a number of improvements to the terms of our EU-IMF Programme loans have already been secured since they were initially agreed in late 2010. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of two separate maturity extensions granted to loans from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), Ireland&rsquo;s debt repayment schedule is already quite favourable.  These extensions mean that the next EFSF maturity is not until 2029 while it is not expected that Ireland will have to refinance any of its EFSM loans before 2027. <\/p>  <p>  Reductions in the cost of the EFSM, EFSF and bilateral loans were also secured and these generate significant interest savings. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the early\u00a0repayment of some 81 per cent of our IMF loans, completed in Quarter 1 2015, also generates significant interest savings and improves the debt repayment schedule as debt that was to mature over the period July 2015 &ndash; January 2021 was replaced with longer-term debt.  This early repayment to the IMF required agreement from the other lenders to waive the mandatory proportional early repayment clause. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to any potential further engagement, it is important to note that\u00a0engagement with\u00a0 any one lender cannot be treated in isolation from other lenders and market expectations for when Programme loans are due to be repaid.

The Manual on Government Deficit and Debt (MGDD) provides further guidance on the implementation of ESA 2010 when reporting GFS.<\/p>  <p>  To test whether a unit is in government, the decision rules that need to be followed are as per ESA 2010 and MGDD.  These rules establish that an entity should be classified in the government sector if it is (a) under public (government) control and (b) if it is a non-market entity.  The first step in the classification process is therefore to determine if the unit is under public control.  However, not all publicly controlled entities are in general government.  This is because if a publicly controlled unit is a market producer (i.e. selling their output at economically significant prices) it is classified outside government as a public corporation.<\/p>  <p>  According to the rules of the MGDD the market\/non-market criterion is applied taking results over a \"number of years\" - in practical terms usually a three year period is taken.  Only when a clear pattern is observed is a reclassification undertaken.  This ensures that government figures are not made volatile through reclassifications arising from exceptional events.<\/p>  <p>  Historically the universities were classified as privately controlled non-profit institutions in the National Accounts.  The CSO, having reviewed the Universities Act, 1997, concluded that, on balance, the universities have sufficient degree of autonomy under this legislation to be classified as being privately and not publicly controlled.  Therefore the universities are not currently included in the list of public corporations published by the CSO.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2012, under the previous version of the ESA standards (ESA95), the CSO reclassified the universities as market producers.  Whilst they remained outside Government as a result of this review, their classification changed from the non-profit sector to the non-financial corporations sector.  Therefore, the universities are currently classified outside Government on the basis that they are (a) privately controlled and (b) market producers and, as such, their debt does not contribute in any way to the national debt.  The CSO is currently reviewing the classification of the universities as part of its routine monitoring of institutional sector classifications.<\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, under the same classification criteria and review process according to the ESA 2010 standards, the institutes of technology and education training boards are at present classified within the Government sector.  Consequently, their indebtedness to agencies outside the Government sector is included as part of the national debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[31673\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the reason only fixed-term contracts are available to many workers in the film industry; if this is an area her Department is examining with a view to improving working conditions and security for persons working in the film industry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[31675\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the reason workers in the film industry are unable to secure contracts of indefinite duration; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.<\/p><p>There may be a number of reasons why certain types of employment contracts are used\u00a0in the film sector, responsibility for which comes within the remit of my colleague the Minister for\u00a0Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  However, from an employment rights point of view, Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment protection legislation designed to protect\u00a0employees engaged under different types of employment\u00a0arrangements.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 provides that fixed-term employees may not\u00a0be treated less favourably than comparable permanent employees, unless the employer can objectively justify the different treatment.  Less favourable treatment of a worker may\u00a0be objectively\u00a0justified if it is for the\u00a0purpose of achieving a legitimate objective of the employer and such\u00a0treatment is appropriate and necessary for that purpose.  However, any justification offered cannot be connected with the fact that the employee is on a fixed-term contract. <\/p><p>The 2003 Act also establishes a framework to prevent abuses arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts.\u00a0 The Act provides that where an employee has been on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts, the total duration of those contracts may not exceed four years.  After this, if the employer wishes to renew the employee&rsquo;s contract, it is deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration\u00a0unless there are objective grounds justifying the renewal of the contract for a fixed term only. <\/p><p>The Unfair Dismissal Act 1977 as amended contains a provision aimed at ensuring that successive temporary contracts are not used in order to avoid that legislation.  It provides that where a fixed-term or specified-purpose contract expires and the individual is re-employed within 3 months, the individual is deemed to have continuous service for the purposes of that Act. <\/p><p>All employers, including those in the film\u00a0industry, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  Where an individual believes they are being deprived of employment rights applicable to employees they may refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court.  WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches.  Complaints can be made on a single complaint form available at the WRC&rsquo;s website <i>www.workplacerelations.ie<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The Competition (Amendment) Act 2017,\u00a0which\u00a0was recently enacted,\u00a0establishes rights for certain categories of self-employed individuals to be represented by a trade union for the purposes of collective bargaining.  I believe that this Act, which met with all Party support in both Houses of the Oireachtas, provides a fine balance in meeting the stated objectives underpinning it whilst, at the same time, remaining consistent with competition law.  It will be of benefit to voiceover actors, session musicians and freelance journalists and it also provides for an application process whereby Trade Unions can apply for an exemption from the application of section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 to collective bargaining and agreements in respect of other specific classes of self-employed workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD01000"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[31814\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the way in which her Department has collaborated with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to promote economic growth in County Wexford; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>IDA Ireland's strategy for 2015-2019 includes a commitment to increase foreign direct investment (FDI) in every region outside of Dublin by 30% to\u00a040%.

This payment was particularly significant given that it has been nine years since the bank last paid a dividend to shareholders.<\/p>  <p>  While there are still challenges facing the Irish banking sector, I would consider it normal for a profitable bank in a stable business environment to pay a prudent, regular dividend to Ordinary Shareholders where there is no impediment to do so, in keeping with a commercial strategy and financial performance objectives espoused by the bank&rsquo;s management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2018","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[31736\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to prioritise investment in public services over tax cuts as requested by a group (details supplied) in budget 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware this Government must ensure that budgetary policy is in compliance with the fiscal rules - formally known as the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) &ndash; which have\u00a0direct application through a number of EU regulations as well as domestically via the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  These rules are designed to promote budgetary discipline and underpin sustainable economic growth.  While Ireland's economy is growing and debt is\u00a0on a downward trajectory, the\u00a0debt level is still comparably high and caution must be exercised due to the potential of rollover risk should interest rates increase .

In 2016 annual inflation in Ireland &ndash; as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was slightly negative at -0.2 per cent.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the boost earlier in the year &ndash; when inflation was supported by temporary factors like higher energy prices &ndash; inflationary pressures have remained muted into 2017.  This is largely due to the recent fall back in oil prices and the continued impact from previous euro-sterling exchange rate developments.  Looking forward, futures markets for oil are suggesting oil prices will continue to stay around their current low levels over the course of 2017.  Against this, the continued growth in domestic demand and the ongoing recovery in the labour market are expected to lead to further services price inflation.  Taking all these factors into account, price pressures are expected to rise only very modestly in 2017.  In the Stability Programme Update 2017, my Department forecast HICP annual inflation of 0.6 per cent for this year, rising gradually to 1.2 per cent in 2018.  These forecasts will be reviewed and updated in preparation for the Budget, which will be published in October this year.  <\/p>  <p>  While consumer price inflation is not expected to rise dramatically over the near term, my Department continues to monitor inflation developments very closely.  Any emergence of sustained price inflation would put pressure on the competitiveness of those sectors that are heavily dependent on exports.  This is particularly true for the indigenous manufacturing sector, the agrifood sector and price sensitive service sectors such as tourism.  In this regard, it is important that, at firm level, overall costs do not get out of line with our competitors and that pay moves in line with productivity developments.<\/p>  <p>  This government will therefore continue to implement competitiveness oriented policies which is the best way domestically to counteract any inflationary tendencies and potential loss of competitiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth","counter":170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD04100"},{"type":"question","counter":171,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[31755\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the economic fundamentals remain positive in terms of the future of the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[31762\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to utilise the principles of reform as experienced previously to remain of major benefit to economic prospects in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[31768\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500078#WRD04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which his Department can forecast economic prospects over the next five years in view of the variety of potential challenges globally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 90 and 95 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's most recent economic forecasts were published in the 2017 Stability Programme Update.  Real GDP growth of 4.3 per cent was projected for this year while growth is forecast to average 3 per cent over the period 2018 &ndash; 2021.  These forecasts have been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.<\/p>  <p>  However, the projections are, as always, contingent forecasts; they are based upon assumptions for key inputs such as trading partner growth and the evolution of commodity prices.  Assumptions on external demand are particularly uncertain at present given the shifting geo-political landscape.  The task of forecasting in an Irish context is further complicated by the globalised nature of the Irish economy and our highly concentrated industrial base.  To provide an indication of the uncertainty surrounding my Department&rsquo;s forecasts, a fan chart is produced in the Stability Programme Update highlighting the confidence bands for real GDP growth.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the many challenges that the Irish economy faces, both externally and domestically, the economic fundamentals are strong;<\/p>  <p>  - Irish competitiveness has been restored.  The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator, a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe, has improved by approximately 20 per cent between its peak in 2008 and May 2017.<\/p>  <p>  - Following a number of years of rebalancing, the composition of activity is also now more sustainable, with all sectors positively contributing to growth. <\/p>  <p>  - Employment has increased significantly with over 200,000 jobs created since 2012, and total employment is now above 2 million. \u00a0Unemployment has fallen by some 8 &frac34; percentage points from its peak in 2012 and at end May stood at 6.4 per cent.<\/p>  <p>  - The public finances have been put on a sustainable path.

However, there is no room for complacency given the considerable economic challenges we face, notably Brexit, the change in policy direction by the new US administration and high levels of uncertainty in the global economy.\u00a0 In light of these circumstances, the focus must be on ensuring that the economy is best placed to weather economic shocks to the greatest extent possible. <\/p>  <p>  The best way to do this is through continued implementation of competitiveness oriented policies - including those that address emerging bottlenecks - along with prudent management of the public finances.

Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  In this regard the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future needs of SMEs. <\/p><p>In terms of monitoring the working capital requirements for SMEs, my Department commissions biannual surveys to ascertain the demand for credit by SMEs.\u00a0 This survey series, most recently conducted by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes on behalf of my Department, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs.  SMEs of all sizes trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included.The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources.<\/p><p>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period October 2016 to March 2017, which can be found at .  The results of this survey show that, when pending applications are excluded, 88% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.  Working capital\/cash flow requirements are provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 31% stating this is why they requested bank finance.  Expansion requirements were provided as the second highest reason for applying for bank finance with 23% of respondents stating that they required finance for this purpose . When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds\/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 78% of working capital coming from this source (up 5%).  The survey also showed that the number of businesses reporting a profit has increased for the fourth year in a row, and a higher proportion of SMEs than ever are pursuing a growth strategy.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The SME State Bodies Group, chaired by my Department, provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Action Plan for Jobs over the past number of years has set out a range of commitments to ensure viable SMEs can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources.<\/p><p>A key objective of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is to ensure that SMEs can access low cost flexible loans from a variety of sources.  The SBCI channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has three bank on-lending partners and five non-bank on-lending partners.

A basic principal of VAT is that the final consumer bears the cost of the VAT charge; registered traders recover VAT on their input costs and charge VAT on their supplies.  Where a taxable person is engaged in making taxable supplies and purchases a commercial property for use in the business the taxable person has an entitlement to reclaim the VAT on the costs incurred in purchasing that property.  The taxable person then accounts for VAT on their business supplies.  In this way VAT is ultimately borne by the final consumer. <\/p>  <p>  Where a person reclaims VAT on the purchase or development of commercial premises and subsequently changes the use of the premises to a non taxable one, that person is required to make an adjustment in respect of the VAT reclaimed to reflect the non-taxable use to which the property is now being put.  If VAT was not clawed back in this fashion the VAT treatment of the transactions would be contrary to the VAT Directive and would result in the payment of a subsidy for users of premises where the use is changed from taxable to non-taxable.  Obviously, such an arrangement would be likely to result in abusive tax planning activities to benefit from VAT deductibility in relation to properties developed for non-taxable use. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to land or buildings, the period over which claw back of VAT incurred in acquiring or developing a property can take place is twenty years from the date the property was purchased.

The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the school referred to by the Deputy in his question, this school had a General Allocation Model allocation\u00a0of 10 hours for the 2016\/17 school year, which combined with\u00a06.38\u00a0resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education,\u00a0gave\u00a0a total allocation to the school of\u00a016.38 additional teaching hours for the 2016\/17 school year.<\/p>  <p>  The profiled allocation indicated for the school under the new allocation model, based on an enrolment of 24 pupils, indicated a profiled need of\u00a012.50 hours.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the profiled allocation for the school did not indicate an increased allocation requirement for the school for 2017\/18, the school maintained its existing level of allocation.<\/p>  <p>  The special education teaching allocation for this school for 2017\/18 is\u00a016.38 hours.<\/p>  <p>  It \u00a0was indicated that this allocation contained a retained allocation of 3.88 hours above the indicated profile of 12.50.<\/p>  <p>  There has therefore been no reduction to the special education teaching allocation for this school.<\/p>  <p>  It should also not be assumed that the allocation will necessarily\u00a0reduce to 12.50 hours at the next profiling stage. <\/p>  <p>  Circular 0013\/2017 states that any future adjustments to the allocations for schools will take place on a graduated basis, which will take account of changes to school enrolments, and the pupil population, including the number of pupils in the complex needs category, since the initial allocations were developed.<\/p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500079#WRE04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500079#WRE04600"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[31618\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500079#WRE04700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to increase the number of ASD units within primary and secondary schools; the existing number of ASD units within primary and secondary schools, by county, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":231,"content":"<p>It is the policy of my Department that all children with Special Educational Needs, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. <\/p><p>Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. <\/p><p>This policy has been informed by published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001), the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (2006) and National Council for Special Education (NCSE) policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016). <\/p><p>The NCSE policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016) found that Students are generally well supported in schools with appropriate curriculum; extensive teacher and SNA supports; improving range of educational placements supported by improved accommodation and equipment; improved teacher knowledge and understanding and a generally good standard of provision at primary and post primary levels.<\/p><p>The NCSE policy advice notes that International Research findings suggest that most students with ASD should be considered for inclusion in mainstream education with their peers, where inclusion is well-planned and well-resourced.<\/p><p>It follows therefore that, where they are able, students should be given every opportunity to\u00a0participate in mainstream settings and only be\u00a0enrolled\/retained in special class and\/or special school settings where their levels of need\u00a0warrant this.<\/p><p>Almost 18,000 students in schools have been diagnosed with autism. \u00a0The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:<\/p><p>- 61% of students to attend\u00a0mainstream schools<\/p><p>- 26% to attend special\u00a0classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and<\/p><p>- 13% to attend special\u00a0schools.<\/p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: <\/p><p>- S\/he has ASD, and that<\/p><p>- S\/he has significant\u00a0learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the\u00a0reasons why this is the case.<\/p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.<\/p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.

One of the main statutory functions of the PSRA is the licensing of Property Service Providers, i.e. auctioneers, estate and letting agents and property management agents.  The Authority is independent in the performance of its functions.  Under Part 7 of the Act, the Authority may also investigate complaints of improper conduct made against licensees and, where improper conduct is found to have occurred, may impose quite sanctions on the licensee, subject to appeal under Part 8 and potentially, subject to High Court approval, up to and including loss of licence.<\/p>  <p>  Section 61 of the Act requires licensees to retain a record of all offers received, including conditional acceptances, in respect of each property offered for  sale for a period of six years.  Any failure to retain such records would constitute improper conduct and would render the licensee eligible for investigation and sanction under Part 7.  In a similar vein, during 2015, the PSRA commenced a programme of compliance audits using the powers granted to it under Part 7.  It is a standard feature of these audits to check that bids on properties have been retained in compliance with section 61 and any failure to do so renders the licensee liable to the full range of sanctions contained in Part 7.  Additionally, Section 58 of the Act prevents licensees from accepting bids at auction from the owners of properties for sale and those connected with them and, again, a licensee found to be in contravention of this section is liable to be investigated and sanctioned under Part 7.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of transparency generally in the property market, the Deputy may wish to note that the PSRA maintains a Residential Property Prices Register which contains prices for all residential properties sold in the State.

The only people responsible for the appalling attacks we have witnessed in the Britain and elsewhere in recent times are those extremists who carry them out.  Those attacks can bring an unfair focus to bear on Muslim communities.  It is absolutely essential that entire communities should not be stigmatised because of the actions of a few.  The acts of violent extremists do not reflect the views of the majority of our Muslim community, which is a peace-loving community of citizens who enrich our national life and who are as appalled as anyone at the brutality of terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  The Imams in all the main mosques and prayer houses in the State have spoken out publicly against the activities of ISIL and other similar groups and it is well known that our Muslim community is not supportive of such groups and their activities.<\/p>  <p>  The risk of persons within the Muslim community becoming disaffected or marginalised has long been recognised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Proactive steps were taken soon after the events of &lsquo;9\/11&rsquo; to seek to address this.  These early preventive measures have formed the basis of a strong model of community engagement with our Muslim community here which is aimed at supporting and protecting that community and identifying and supporting the community to deal with vulnerable individuals within it.<\/p>  <p>  This engagement is led through the Garda Racial, Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO), which is in contact with many of our minority communities through the Garda network of Ethnic Liaison Officers.  In respect of the Muslim community, there is direct and ongoing liaison with the main Mosques and Islamic cultural centres.  The GRIDO also feeds into the European Commission-sponsored Radicalisation Awareness Network.<\/p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s policies concerned with resettlement, migrant integration, equality, combating discrimination and building relationships with minority communities play an essential role in respect of minority communities, including Muslim migrants, through positive integration into society and my Department actively leads in this regard.

The Strategy contains 76 actions targeted at Government, public and private sector organisations and local communities.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p><p>The area  referred to by the Deputy forms part of the DMR North  Division.  I have been informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to this Division on the 31 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 664 with 49 Garda Reserves and 40 Civilians. Of these, 216 members were assigned to Ballymun  District and 78 to Santry Station. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace. I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 75 of whom were assigned to the DMR North Division.  I am also informed that another 200 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday 6 July and that a further four hundred are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division  in the coming years. <\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.

New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission, must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.

These provisions were brought into operation in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the DSS to begin.  The recruitment and appointment of the Director of the DSS, and the appointment of DSS staff, is a matter for the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health) with the approval of the Minister for Health. <\/p><p>In relation to Wards of Court, the Act provides that adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements provided for in the Act on a phased basis over 3 years from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act.

A ward who continues to have capacity needs will be discharged from wardship and offered the decision-making support option most appropriate to his or her needs.  The new support options must be operational before the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 can be repealed and the transition from wardship can commence.  In the interim, capacity cases will continue to be dealt with by the wardship court.<\/p><p>It is intended that the key preparations will be put in place during the remainder of this year under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for commencement orders for the remaining provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  It is not possible at the moment to provide an exact time line for the finalisation of these commencement orders, not least because we will need to have the Director of the DSS in place to fully ascertain the time-line.

The Accountant of the Courts of Justice has been publishing annual financial statements on court funds since 2001 which have been furnished to the Minister for Justice and Equality and also to the Minister for Finance\/Public Expenditure and Reform.

The position of the State in relation to compensating a beneficiary for a loss incurred is restricted to situations were an administrative error has resulted in a loss.  Very few such cases have arisen.  The only other possible situation where compensation could be considered could be where as a result of negligence a loss was incurred.  In this regard and, as requested by the Public Accounts Committee in July 2015, an independent external review of the Growth Fund, covering the period May 2007 to January 2009, was published in November 2016.

This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m.<\/p>  <p>  - Key elements of the initiative include:<\/p>  <p>  - the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million over a three year period;<\/p>  <p>  - the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points valued at &euro;1.2 million;<\/p>  <p>  - measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia valued at &euro;2.7 million.<\/p>  <p>  The roll-out of Intensive Home Care packages commenced in January 2015 and monitoring of the allocation and uptake of these packages to persons with dementia is ongoing.  By May 2017, the HSE had delivered a total of 217 dementia-specific intensive homecare packages at an average cost of &euro;953 per week. There are currently 122 people with dementia in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package with a further 16 approved and 12 applications in progress.  In addition to the Intensive Home Care Packages the HSE has continued to provide mainstream home help and routine Home Care packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme. <\/p>  <p>  It is Government policy that, wherever possible and appropriate, people should be cared for in their own homes and communities, and the National Dementia Strategy specifically restates this commitment to those living with dementia. <\/p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are working on a mid-term review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will be published in the Autumn and will identify the achievements so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy over the next 12 months and beyond.  The resources required for the ongoing implementation of the Strategy can only be considered in the context of the Estimates and Budget process.  The mid-term review will assist in identifying further actions required and will be helpful in the context of budgetary considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500082#WRH02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500082#WRH02100"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[31589\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500082#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the review process for the inclusion of the freestyle libre device and its related testing strips in the long-term illness scheme, the drug repayment scheme and for GMS reimbursement is complete; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":376,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500082#WRH02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Oireachtas Joint Committee Reports","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500082#WRH02400"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[31590\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500082#WRH02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there is a timeframe for the review of the report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare also called Sl&aacute;intecare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":379,"content":"<p>I have no doubt that the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report will come to mark a critical milestone in the history of our health service and can provide us with a solid framework and guidance for health services development over the next decade.

A number of scientific studies have looked at the specific issue of human disease and gulls (from the early 1980s on; the most recent in 2005).  While there is some evidence that wild birds (including gulls) may transmit salmonella to animal feed and drinking water and by this mechanism potentially lead to human infection, the evidence for this in each instance was considered weak.  Studies that have looked at the likelihood of direct spread of salmonella from gulls to humans conclude that gulls as carriers of Salmonella constitute little health hazard to human health concluding that there is only a low risk of transmitting Salmonella from either gulls or feed factories they may contaminate to humans or domestic animals.<\/p>  <p>  The HPSC gathers information on the causes of outbreaks of infectious disease and for individual cases of infectious disease it collects information on individual risk factors (i.e. those factors known to contribute to disease development but not necessarily proven in the particular case being examined).  A look back for the last ten years by the HPSC indicates that out of 25,000 reported cases of campylobacter and 3,500 cases of salmonella there have been three cases of salmonellosis that could be explained by bird contact (two of these were pet birds) and two cases of campylobacter, one of which mentioned proximity to gulls.  This means an association but does not mean that birds caused the disease.  <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the serious and increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance and the requirement for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to health issues, the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) established a high level National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee to address this issue.  The Committee meets Ireland&rsquo;s requirements to have an Intersectoral co-ordination mechanism for addressing AMR at the European level.<\/p>  <p>  As well as work on enhancing surveillance between the health and agriculture sectors, the Committee&rsquo;s work in 2017 has overseen the development of Ireland&rsquo;s first National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020.  This ambitious 3-year Plan has been jointly prepared by the two Departments in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders and covers the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as human health.  Following the World Health Organisation's Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (2015), which requires all countries to have a national action plan in place by mid-2017, Ireland's draft Plan lists Strategic Interventions and Activities, responsible bodies and priority rankings of timelines for implementation. <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that a Memorandum for the Government on the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020 will be submitted this week to Cabinet seeking its approval and publication.  Subject to approval of the National Action Plan, an implementation plan will be developed separately which will address means of tackling antimicrobial resistance as appropriate to each sector.<\/p>  <p>  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on public health risks in other EU Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500084#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Departments","counter":479,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500084#WRK02900"},{"type":"question","counter":480,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[31719\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500084#WRK03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of plans being considered by him regarding the accident and emergency department in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":481,"content":"<p>My Department and the HSE are committed to securing and developing the role of Portlaoise Hospital within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. <\/p>  <p>   Reports on Portlaoise Hospital in recent years point to the need for reconfiguration of some services to ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff that can safely meet their needs.

This effectively means that we are aiming to achieve neutrality by reducing agricultural emissions, increasing carbon-sequestration, reducing emissions from the land sector and increasing fossil fuel and energy intensive materials displacement.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Article 4.1 of The Paris Agreement 2015 also introduces the concept of a &lsquo;balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases&rsquo;.  However, neither process provides robust definitions of these concepts therefore, my Department together with the EPA and Teagasc will use opportunities in research to explore science based approaches to define indicators and metrics which could be used to define balance and neutrality in terms of the long term impacts on climate of contemporary emissions and removals of greenhouse gases which ensure sustainable food production is not threatened.<\/p>  <p>  An action relating to this research has been included in the agriculture, forest and land use chapter in the National Mitigation Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to defining sustainability and the sustainability of the Irish family farm Food Wise 2025 sets out Ireland&rsquo;s future agriculture growth to 2025 and beyond. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy is predicated on a &ldquo;sustainable growth&rdquo; scenario across all sectors including beef, dairy, sheep and pigs with a view to securing greater efficiencies with consequent reductions in emissions intensity.  Sustainable intensification is defined as &ldquo;..improving productivity while using natural resources in a manner which protects them into the future.&rdquo;\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As part of the implementation phase of Food Wise 2025, the Environmental Sustainability Committee was established to evaluate and assess the delivery of the sustainability and mitigation actions.  This Committee includes representatives of key Government Departments, State agencies and academia.<\/p>  <p>  As the deputy will be aware from previous replies the Department is undertaking a number of actions to translate this concept of sustainability into reality, including through the Rural Development Programme, worth almost &euro;4 billion over 7 years.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the sustainability of the Irish family farm, I refer the deputy to the findings of the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) report &ldquo;Evaluation of the livestock sector's contribution to the EU greenhouse gas emissions (GGELS)&rdquo; which states that Ireland&rsquo;s food production systems provide for some of the lowest carbon footprint profiles across the EU on a per unit basis.  In relation to Irish dairy production the JRC found Ireland (with Austria) had the lowest cow milk emissions (1 kg per kg of product).  This compares with an EU average of 1.4kg\/kg. <\/p>  <p>  The Report also stated that Ireland had the lowest emissions per kg of pork (4.8 kg\/kg) &ndash; EU average 7.5kg\/kg and Ireland&rsquo;s emissions per kg of beef were 18.4 kg\/kg &ndash; EU Average 22.2kg\/kg.<\/p>  <p>  It also recognised with regard to dairy systems in Europe, intensive systems create less methane and nitrous oxide emissions than extensive ones, but this is countered by higher emissions from land use and land use change.  Lowest emissions are created by extensive grassland systems, such as those in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The efficiency of our temperate grassland based production system has also been recognised by the FAO.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to actively engage in the whole of government approach on climate policy to examine the best means of encouraging sustainable intensification of Irish food production, while optimising the sectors contribution to greenhouse gas mitigation and sequestration including through afforestation and other forest sector activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500085#WRL02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Organic Farming Scheme Payments","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500085#WRL03000"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[31739\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500085#WRL03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of a payment to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":533,"content":"<p>The person named has received\u00a0the first instalment of his Organic Farming Scheme payment in respect of 2016.\u00a0 However,\u00a0payment in respect of parcels that were originally in the Agriculture Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) could not be processed at that time.\u00a0 The\u00a0payment due on these parcels will be included in the balancing payment due to the person named.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500085#WRL03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500085#WRL03400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Salmon Management Report","counter":534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500085#WRL03300"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[31819\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500085#WRL03400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding a review of river management at the river Slaney near Clohamon, Bunclody, Enniscorthy, County Wexford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":536,"content":"<p>The current salmon status of the river Slaney is based on the information provided by the Standing Scientific Committee on Salmon (SSCS) and the advice and proposals provided by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) to me as Minister.

Following last week's announcement, further campaigns will be rolled out over the second half of 2017 addressing issues such as food waste, waste prevention, explaining how per lift and weight based charging models work and increasing and improving recycling, <\/p>  <p>  In terms of monies spent to date,\u00a0a grant of almost &euro;28,000\u00a0was paid to the Regional Waste Management Planning Offices in preparation for the proposed introduction of a per kilogramme pay by weight model in 2016.

In the short to medium-term, driven by carbon pricing, the mix of non-renewables will shift away from more carbon-intensive fuels, like peat and coal, to lower-carbon fuels like natural gas. By 2050, fossil fuels will be largely replaced by renewable energy sources.&rdquo; <\/i><\/p><p>The White Paper also notes that &quot;<i>Oil and gas will contribute to security of supply through the period of transition, on a declining basis over time.

At the centre of the system is each citizen and household who have responsibility for the management and disposal of the waste that they generate.<\/p>  <p>  Effective enforcement of waste legislation is vital for the credibility of our systems of waste management.  he key legislative codes in combating litter and illegal dumping matters are the Litter Pollution Acts and the Waste Management Acts; in particular, section 32 of the Waste Management Act places the responsibility and a general duty of care on the holders of waste to ensure that it is managed in a manner that does not cause environmental pollution.  In addition, section 34 of the Waste Management Act requires all bodies involved in the commercial collection of waste to have this activity authorised by a waste collection permit.  Penalties available under the Waste Management Acts are substantial. Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal or collection of waste are liable to a Class A fine on summary conviction and\/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and\/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.<\/p>  <p>  Waste enforcement is supported by state funding for waste enforcement officers.  I have made &euro;9 million available from the Environment Fund this year to support the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) and the recruitment and continued employment of a network of local authority waste enforcement officers.

In response to the hugely positive reaction from local authorities and communities since I launched this measure, I have made further funds available to support it.

This proposal is also\u00a0incorporated\u00a0in Action 6 of the Action Plan for Rural Development, launched in January 2017.  My Department is presently progressing the drafting of the necessary revisions to the planning regulations to give effect to this action and it is intended that the new regulations, which will require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, will be made as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  While I have no plans to initiate specifically an audit of vacant commercial properties, there are a number of initiatives which seek to address this issue.  My Department is\u00a0working with Dublin City Council in the context of the Living City Initiative (LCI), to explore the potential for further streamlining of the approach to redeveloping and re-utilising vacant properties.  The aim of the\u00a0LCI is to bring life back into designated historic areas of our main cities by offering tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment or conversion of certain buildings, where qualifying conditions are met. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the City Council has examined approximately 11,000 rateable units in its functional area. From a visual analysis in a sample number of streets,\u00a0the City Council has\u00a0estimated that there may be approximately 4,000 vacant units above commercial premises that could potentially be converted into residential use in its functional area.  Despite amendments introduced to the\u00a0LCI in Budget 2016 by the Minister for Finance to make the Initiative more attractive, uptake by property owners remains limited.\u00a0Dublin City Council therefore intends to re-launch it shortly to a wider target group in the hope of wider participation by property owners. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0also understand that\u00a0Cork City Council carried out an employment and land use survey in 2011 which recorded vacancy above commercial premises in Cork City Centre but did not assess its suitability for residential purposes. \u00a0The Council is\u00a0currently preparing an Action Plan for the medieval core of the city in 2017 which will include a pilot survey of the potential for utilising vacant upper-floor spaces for residential purposes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Heritage Council has been\u00a0working with a number of local authorities on a Town Centre Health Check programme which includes the undertaking of assessments\u00a0of the level of vacancy of residential, commercial and retail premises in town centres with a view to revitalising them and enhancing their economic sustainability.  I am fully supportive of this approach to obtain accurate data on property vacancy and the subsequent development of Action Plans by the local authorities involved.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500087#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regeneration Projects Funding","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500087#WRN02000"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[31624\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070500087#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will review the decision to reduce the Ballymun social regeneration fund in view of recent increased anti-social behaviour in the area.","asker":"1362","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":626,"content":"<p>Social regeneration funding (currently &euro;1.7 million p.a.) for community initiatives in Ballymun will continue to be fully recouped by my Department to Dublin City Council in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The substantial regeneration\u00a0programme, which included 24 projects, is now\u00a0complete.\u00a0Approximately &euro;972 million was spent on the programme, &euro;775.3 million\u00a0of which was\u00a0recouped by my Department.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s oversight of the regeneration projects at this location\u00a0was principally\u00a0concerned with general progress on the overall programme and it continually liaised with the local authority\u00a0on the strategic approach and general phasing of works.
