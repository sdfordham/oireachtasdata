Obviously there is a strong difference of opinion between the HSE and the service provider.  I have a concern as to whether the Deloitte report could be classed as independent.

Notwithstanding that, the report includes tables and data that were simply presented by the HSE.<\/p><p>My understanding is that there was also a slimmed-down version of this that was a draft and got lost in the ether somewhere.  It is very similar to what was being requested of us when we were doing reports.  A draft report is done.  It must go to the person who is the payer.  They have an influence and a say.  Drafts go over and back.  The final product ends up being not truly independent but yet it is presented to us as the independent analysis.  How independent is it?  I want the HSE to come back in because it all arises from comments made by Mr. Healy of the HSE, who has not been here.  He was the one who made the comment originally about the costs and he needs to come before us.  There was a table in the earlier draft that did answer the question for the service providers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#A00600","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Who said that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The service provider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#B00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>What is our basis for saying that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#B00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The service provider said in its letter-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#B00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The letter from-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#B00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The service providers received the draft-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#B00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>But we have not seen it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#B00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>That is the point; we should see it.  I am only relaying what it is telling us.  It is telling us that there was an earlier draft, which had the table and did make the distinction between the cost of care for Grace and whether that would then involve a net increase or decrease in its funding.  That was the source of the contention.  That did not make its way into the final report and as the question then is why not, I also want to hear from the author of the report.  The author of the report needs to come before the committee because this chimes with a point I was making about the third level sector, where these type of organisations are being asked to come in and do so-called independent reports.  I am asking how independent they are.  What process is used?  Is it lending itself to reports coming to us that really give clear answers to the questions being put?  I am very concerned about it and I think this is a good case for us to examine whether this is the case.  Perhaps it is the case, perhaps it is fair and perhaps they have answered the question but I have concerns.  My point is that the HSE needs to come back, including the director general and Mr. Healy, who was at the heart of the comments that caused the difficulty in the first place, as well as the author of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#B00900","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I know we have timetabled dealing with this issue when the HSE is in front of us again in a few weeks' time but I share some of the concerns.

It gets tweaked and goes forward and backwards even if it is independent.  We are getting a steer for some of the questions we should address from the whistleblower and I wonder whether we should have further engagement with the whistleblower in advance of the meeting with the HSE.  What we do not want to do is go on a merry-go-round where we have the HSE before us and there are questions that are not asked when we had that meeting.

I appreciate everything the whistleblower has said.  We would not be here discussing it without the whistleblower, who has done an enormous service not just to Grace but in highlighting the issues that have come to light as a result of this over a period of years.  In addition to that, the whistleblower, who has written to us, was personally involved in this case and has more information than anybody else.  As a result of the work of the whistleblower not solely through this committee and the previous one but through other people in the Oireachtas, this issue has been highlighted very extensively resulting in the Oireachtas setting up a commission of investigation - the Farrelly commission.  That is how the Oireachtas has decided that this matter is to be dealt with from here on in.  The commission is commencing its public sessions next week and I do not think it is appropriate for the Committee of Public Accounts to engage in any significant discussions in parallel with the commission of investigation established by the Oireachtas.  That is one issue.<\/p><p>The second issue about which I am concerned is the fact that there is no reference in the correspondence we received today that the service provider, the employer of the people concerned, has been to the High Court on this matter.  I will read into the record page five of the Deloitte report.  It is the executive summary.  I could read out a lot of it but I will just read out this particular point.  Before I make that point, Deloitte made the point in the report that much of the documentation that was supplied, most of which was from the HSE and some of which was from the service provider, was included in the report but that Deloitte had not substantiated the information from either source.  There is information from both sides that Deloitte did not feel was its job to substantiate but was given it and included it.  Everything in that is not from Deloitte and we all agree on that.  The paragraph on page five of the executive summary states:<\/p><blockquote>In April 2017 the HSE and the Service Provider agreed a funding position for 2016 and a payment schedule for 2017.  Subsequently, the High Court approved settlement terms on 27 April 2017 which included a care settlement of &euro;600,000 for past care and &euro;120,484 per annum for the individual&rsquo;s care going forward.  The HSE contacted the Service Provider on 19 May 2017 to update the previously agreed payment schedule and payment of the &euro;600,000 was made on 2 June 2017.  <\/blockquote> <p>This matter has been before the High Court.  The settlement figure and the cost of care has been accepted by the service provider and the HSE and has been approved by the High Court.  We are not revisiting a matter that has been approved by the High Court at the request of the service provider and the HSE.  It is not our job to unpick a High Court-approved agreement.  As Chairman, I am saying that we will not be going there.  If the Parliamentary Legal Adviser tells us it is safe for the Oireachtas to consider unpicking an approved agreement in the High Court, well and good.  If the Parliamentary Legal Adviser takes the view that it is appropriate given that the Oireachtas has set up a commission of investigation, all of which should examine the issues the whistleblower has highlighted, our response should be to forward the whistleblower's letter to the commission established by the Oireachtas to look into this matter.  I am making it very clear that we are not unpicking a High Court settlement and we are not trespassing over a commission established by the Oireachtas.  The letter in front of us makes no reference whatsoever to the High Court agreement.  It is a valid letter.<\/p><p>It is a great letter, but it ignores the fact the employer organisation of the people who wrote to us has an agreement in the High Court.  I am just saying we have to take that into account and I propose we send it off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#B01700","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I accept some of what the Chairman is saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#C00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I am being very clear in what I am saying now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#C00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Of course the Chairman is entitled to be clear, and he is very clear, but he is conflating two issues, with respect, if I can just respond.  Of course there was a High Court case, and it was in respect of whether moneys were due to the organisation.  The High Court outcome was that there was money due and it was paid.  That is not what is in question.  The question is whether the group itself was targeted in terms of its funding, and whether a statement made by Mr. Healy to the previous incarnation of the Committee of Public Accounts was accurate.<\/p> <p>  This is not about us trying to interfere with the commission of investigation or anything like it.  It is about how the HSE interacts with the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is about the information it gives us and whether we have the right then to interrogate it and examine it.  We also have a duty to examine the Deloitte report.  I have very real concerns about whether it really is independent.  It is being presented to us as independent analysis.  I will give just one example of what it says, because there is a lot of spin going on here as well.  The HSE states, and this is from Tony O'Brien in his letter in response, \"Consequently, the Service Provider was not treated either unfairly or disproportionately when compared to other similarly funded organisations.\"<\/p> <p>  The report actually states at paragraph 6.13 that HSE south east advised Deloitte that in its view, based on the comparative analysis, the cuts visited on the service provider were in line with cuts nationally and locally.  The report just gives us the HSE's views.  That is not independent or an analysis.  A whole section in the report gives the HSE view and states Deloitte does not offer any opinion.  Where is the view of the service provider?  I am not comfortable at all with this report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#C00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Okay.

We cannot just bookend it and state that is it because there is a commission of investigation.  That commission of investigation is dealing with all sorts of other issues and may not deal with the issues we are dealing with.  It will deal with its issues and we will deal with our issues, and our issues are how organisations interact with us.  The HSE has interacted with us on this issue for a long time, it has not been to our satisfaction, and we still have not resolved this issue.  With respect to the High Court, I do not believe the service providers had to put that in the letter, because they were dealing specifically with what was said at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, what subsequently happened and what is in the report.  It has dealt with that.  Nobody is contesting now whether the &euro;600,000 was due.  It is not in question.

The HSE quite happily gave over this figure of &euro;600,000.  It wants it both ways and it simply cannot have it both ways.  I disagree with the Chairman.  It is very specific.

The letter from the whistleblowers today specifically states in the third paragraph:<\/p><blockquote>In this regard, the Committee must note that Deloitte makes no finding regarding the fairness, or otherwise, of the Service Provider's treatment by the HSE in relation to funding.  This was not within the Terms of Reference, but rather is a matter for the Farrelly Commission.<\/blockquote> <p>The whistleblowers writing to us today state the fairness of the funding is a matter for the Farrelly commission.

These are direct questions around the governance of HIQA, its interactions with the NTPF, the role of the chairman of the board of HIQA, the management or otherwise of conflicts of interests, and a specific meeting that happened at a specific time, the minutes of which are now in our possessions and raise alarming questions in terms of oversight, in terms of roles and in terms of the management of this scenario.  I suggest that we have the HIQA executives return to us because we need to go back over that ground around conflicts of interest, around the role of the board and around the fact that, as the Chairman quite correctly states, it is not a body that sets or regulates fees or charges.  We need the chairman of the board here to assist us in examining those and we need an account from the chairman of the board of that meeting, why he was at that meeting, what happened at that meeting, etc.  We also need Mr. Tadhg Daly from Nursing Homes Ireland because he was the convenor of the meeting in question.<\/p> <p>  I take the Chairman's point that it would be helpful for this specific investigation to have the NTPF present as well but I am not suggesting, although we need to do it, the wider investigation of fair deal.  This is a specific matter.  This is an account of a specific meeting, that is to say the least alarming and that raises the most fundamental questions around accountability and governance and people's roles and limitations.

I saw the correspondence from the clerk whom I thank for it.  I would not necessarily agree with it and one would not expect me to.  We have unfinished business, particularly in regard to the process that was engaged in here.  I believe there are serious issues with the evidence given.  We are not getting the full picture.  I understand the areas into which the clerk has said we do not need to stray.  The justice committee can deal with them; that is fine and I understand that, but I do not believe it has to be a long meeting.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Chairman's suggestion that we should have the author of the report, Mr. O'Driscoll, come here.  I believe - I am supporting Deputy Marc MacSharry who wrote the letter to the committee a couple of weeks ago - that we need to have Mr. John Barrett, Mr. O'Driscoll, Mr. Leahy and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality come here.  The Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality needs to join the dots on a few things in respect of the process and procedure followed because the evidence given here when we were dealing with this issue had loads of holes in it, certainly for me.  I have followed the issue very thoroughly, as everyone knows.  There are real issues that need to be addressed but strictly not about policy or the subject matter that falls within the remit of the justice committee.  This is about the process that was gone through and we have a duty on behalf of the taxpayer to get to the bottom of it.  There is a requirement for us to bring in the four individuals in question.  We can set a defined timetime for the meeting, if the Chairman wants.  If he wants to have it after lunch after another meeting in a couple of weeks, I have no issue with that.<\/p> <p>  In fairness and in deference to those concerned with the issue about which we spoke in regard to HIQA, I am not even saying what I propose has to be done in the next week or two, as long as we do it in a couple of weeks' time.  It has to happen because this issue is far from over.  I have so many questions about the evidence given and, in particular, the process used.  This is historical; it is about decision-making in the spending of public money.  I believe we need the full picture.  We need the author of the report who, by error, I left out and did not include in my list.  It was accidental and right to correct me.  The author, Mr. John Barrett, gives out the resources and has asked to come before the committee, or said, in writing, as members can see, that he is willing to come before it.  The person in charge of policing in Dublin, Mr. Leahy, and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality should also be invited because certainly there are questions that come from the Department's side also.  I do not believe the meeting has to be long.  In fact, if we are given the answers, it could be very short.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#G00500","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>The last point is pertinent.  Had we received answers at the last meeting - I was not here - we might not have to revisit the issue.<\/p> <p>  On the report from the secretariat, it was good and useful in that it set out what our remit was and was not.  That is useful for us in influencing what decision we will make.  I have looked at five areas of concern that fall within the committee's remit, some of which were not reflected in the report.  The first is the criteria outlined at the meeting by the acting Commissioner and those cited in the report: the consultation procedures and the involvement of HR which would involve Mr. Barrett and evidence, process and procedures for decision-making which do fall within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Also to be considered are the criteria used in considering the closure of the station and delays in providing the committee with the report.  The latter issue rests with the Department of Justice and Equality.  For that reason, I support Teachta Alan Kelly in saying we do need to have people come here.  I reiterate the point I made at the last meeting that I would prefer if, at the end of the proposed meeting, we had a very short report giving our view.  Notwithstanding the secretariat's constructive and helpful report, it is our committee.  Obviously, we have a series of concerns and questions.  Let us ask them, tease them out and produce a very short report giving our opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#G00600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I understand that.

Every question we have asked here was put to him and he answered all of them in terms of resources, who he consulted - Mr. Pat Leahy, local management and the assistant Commissioner - and the people he chose to consult.  He deals with quite a few of those issues.  All I am saying is I want to make sure this committee will not duplicate questions already asked, as members can understand.  I believe Mr. O'Driscoll has answered quite a lot of the questions asked.  He has made very it clear that it is a Government decision and that it is included in the programme for Government.  Therefore, it is Government policy and not within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is said at the beginning of every single meeting here that witnesses should not discuss policies of the Government or their merits of those policies.  It is a political matter, one for the D&aacute;il Chamber and everywhere else, including the justice committee.  It is for every member of that committee to do that, not the Committee of Public Accounts.  The only point I am making is that we must be conscious of the work the justice committee has done and not repeat it.  We would begin to look foolish if we were to repeat it.  We know that there is a policy which is outside our remit, but that is politics.  There will be issues about costs to be incurred next year which will rightly be matters for the justice committee to consider in dealing with the Estimates for 2018.

The gentleman in question also wrote to me requesting that I recuse myself because of what he determined as my long association with the college.  To me, the implication of his correspondence was that a partiality or conflict of interest might impair my fair adjudication of any evidence or correspondence that this committee might decide to consider.  I wrote back refuting this and explained that I do not intend to recuse myself or disqualify myself from consideration.  My association with St. Angela's College is that my father was a board member in the 1990s, which long predates these matters, and there is a family member on the academic staff, which again would have no relevance to this matter.  I do not intend to recuse myself because of that.<\/p> <p>  In my work in the Oireachtas over the years, when the Sion Hill home economics college in Dublin was being closed, I strongly advocated that it would come under St. Angela's remit and that it would deal with the Sion Hill students.  This subsequently happened.  More recently I have lobbied during the merger process.  St. Angela's College was always a constituent college of the National University of Ireland Galway and it is now in the process of being fully merged with NUIG.  There was an issue around staff as they came in.  Even though many of the St. Angela's staff held PhDs and are fully qualified, NUIG proposed to take them on as university teachers rather than lecturers.  This would obviously have had implications for the staff in terms of their promotional prospects.  I certainly advocated in this and it was successful.  There has not been, however, any involvement by me or my family in the issue that is before the committee this morning.<\/p> <p>  In consideration of the correspondence sent to Deputy Catherine Murphy, I agree fully that there are matters to be considered.  It alleges the misappropriation of public funds for uses other than their intended purpose.  It would be appropriate that this gentleman and representatives from St. Angela's College would appear before the committee, or at the absolute minimum we would seek clarification and comment on these issues from them as a matter of urgency.

While there has been an outcome from the court case, it appears that NUIG may have a different interpretation of that outcome than the authorities at St. Angela's or this gentleman, and this may be holding up the progression of the merger of the two campuses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#H02500","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Which two campuses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#H02600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":192,"content":"<p>St. Angela's is in Sligo, and while it was a constituent college of NUI, it is now merging with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#H02700","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy mean NUIG?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#H02800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>NUIG, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#H02900","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":195,"content":"<p>We will write a letter asking for a note on the issue of the legal costs and any effects on services.

The primary function of TII is to provide quality transport infrastructure and services.  Its main responsibilities relate to the construction, repair and maintenance of the network of motorways and national primary and secondary roads, and the construction, maintenance, and operation of the Luas light rail system in Dublin.  In addition, TII acts as the payment agent for grants to local authorities for local and regional roads on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Department retains decision making over the allocation of the funding, and is responsible for the oversight and monitoring function for those roads.<\/p><p> The financial statements for TII for 2016 received an unqualified opinion.  TII's income in 2016 totalled &euro;1,078 million.  This sum included State grants of &euro;919 million from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's Vote; road toll income of &euro;137 million, mostly from the M50 and the Dublin Port tunnel; and other income of &euro;21.7 million.  TII's expenditure in 2016, including interest and other finance charges, amounted to &euro;911 million.  Over 90% of TII's recurrent expenditure in 2016 was related to payments in respect of the road network.  In 2016 TII paid local authorities just under &euro;200 million for national primary and secondary roads and, on behalf of the Department, &euro;371 million for regional and local roads.  TII also paid almost &euro;87 million in operational payments for public private partnership road projects, plus &euro;29 million in related finance charges.  It paid &euro;49 million in respect of tunnel and tolling operations, plus &euro;7.4 million in related finance charges.  Its administration charges amounted to &euro;22 million in the year.  In addition to its recurrent expenditure, it invested over &euro;230 million directly in transport infrastructure in 2016.<\/p><p> TII has undertaken a significant number of PPP projects as a means of providing a substantial part of the national motorway network and related service areas.  Eleven public private partnership road projects were in operation in July 2017, with a further three under construction.  The M17-M18 motorway has since been opened.  <\/p><p> Chapter 4 of my report on the accounts of public services 2016 aims to provide an overview of and update on public private partnerships.  I previously reported on such projects in my 2012 report.  Apart from recording the agreement of new PPP deals in the intervening period, the chapter identifies notable developments in three areas in respect of TII's PPP projects.  A number of risk-sharing arrangements in place for road schemes have given rise to significant income for TII in the period reviewed.  They arose from contract provisions for toll revenue-sharing and insurance cost rebates.  Requesting variations after a PPP contract has been agreed or a motorway has come into operation will, in general, lead to additional costs for TII.  Such variations requested in the period 2013 to 2016 have added costs for TII estimated at a total of &euro;13.3 million.  It has incurred additional expenditure in respect of two contracts which included provision for guaranteed payments to the private partner where traffic levels fell below specified floor levels set out in the PPP contract.  In 2016, &euro;1.2 million was paid to the private partner under the M3 Clonee-Kells contract and &euro;4.6 million in the case of the Limerick tunnel contract.  As the diagrams shown on screen illustrate, the guaranteed payments under the M3 project are projected to end in 2019 in a medium traffic growth scenario.  However, annual traffic guaranteed payments are expected to continue for the full duration of the Limerick tunnel contract.  TII provides on its balance sheet for the projected future expenditure under the guarantees, estimated at &euro;133 million on a current net value basis.<\/p><p> Road projects account for over one half of the projected future payments under PPP projects.  Post-implementation review of PPP projects is important in identifying lessons that can be learned for future projects.  Publication of such reviews would assist in improving accountability for and public understanding of whether PPPs achieve value for money.  To date, TII has reviewed nine road projects, but the results have not been published.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has committed to including a requirement to publish post-project reviews, subject to redaction of any commercially sensitive information, in a revision of the public spending code under way and revised PPP guidance to be issued in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#J01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Nolan to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#K00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507795200,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it to discuss TII's 2016 financial statements.  Following the August 2015 merger of the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency, our remit in respect of national road infrastructure has been expanded to also include light rail infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Light rail infrastructure activities within the greater Dublin area are determined by the National Transport Authority, NTA, which provides the strategic framework for the planning and delivery of public transport infrastructure and the provision of passenger services in the greater Dublin area.  The NTA has assigned its functions in securing the provision of light rail passenger services and the management of the Luas operating contract to TII.  Since the commissioning of the initial lines in 2004, Luas has been operationally self-sufficient in ongoing operating costs, including maintenance, which are met without the need for a Government subvention.  <\/p> <p>  TII is managing the programme of works associated with the extension of the Luas Green Line northward from its current terminus at St. Stephen's Green.  When the Luas cross city extensions come into operation this December, the Luas Red Line and the Luas Green Line will cross in the city centre, with an easy passenger interchange between the two.  The Luas Green Line will at that point extend from Brides Glen to Broombridge, adjacent to Irish Rail's Broombridge station in the north west of the city.<\/p> <p>  The Government's seven-year capital investment plan includes provision for a new metro project for Dublin.  The project is defined as a high-speed, high-capacity, high-frequency public transport link from the city centre to Dublin Airport and Swords, with an underground city centre section.  It is anticipated that the metro will ultimately tie into the existing Luas Green Line rail system, enabling the through-running of metro trams from Swords to Brides Glen.  TII is engaged, in collaboration with the NTA, in the process of developing the design of the new metro north project with the stated objective of the commencement of construction in 2021, subject to a number of positive outcomes, including the securing of planning approval, funding and the procurement of various works packages.<\/p> <p>  TII has succeeded in modernising much of the national primary road network in recent years, bringing significant economic and other benefits, including much safer driving conditions on the improved roads, reduced journey times, reduced wear and tear on travellers and vehicles, as well as environmental improvements.  The completion of the major inter-urban motorway network marked a tipping point as TII's activities have become increasingly focused on managing and maintaining the road assets in place and improving safety, as well as removing bottlenecks where resources allow.  Current funding levels for investment in the national road network are historically low.  There is now a gap between the funding allocation and what is actually required to maintain the existing network in an adequate condition.  <\/p> <p>  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's study Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport acknowledges that the road network should be maintained to a sufficient standard to ensure the value of the original capital investment will not depreciate prematurely in the coming years.  The framework states, \"Amongst the main priorities over the medium term will be ensuring adequate maintenance of the National Road Network in order to protect the value of previous investments and target the improvement of specific road segments where there is a clear economic justification\".  The replacement cost of the network is in the order of &euro;30 billion and, on the basis of a 20 to 30-year average life cycle, it would deteriorate to the extent of &euro;1 billion per year in the absence of this investment.  Within this context and mindful of the limited funding levels earmarked for the national roads programme in the early years of the Government's infrastructure and capital investment plan 2016 to 2021, TII's priorities in 2016 were as follows.<\/p> <p>  Priority No. 1 is asset management, network rehabilitation and network operations.  The first priority beyond existing liabilities is to maintain the asset value of the network and ensure its safety, reliability and functionality.  This is critical to ensuring the network performs efficiently and safely and continues to support national economic growth and competitiveness.  <\/p> <p>  Priority No. 2 is national secondary road improvements, bottleneck improvement projects, safety projects and traffic management projects.  It is the case that most of the national secondary network routes are deficient in terms of capacity, safety and alignment.  TII will seek to implement improvements as funding permits.<\/p><p> Priority No. 3 deals with major improvement projects.  The investment in the national road network in recent years has vastly improved the level of service provided on many of the country&rsquo;s busiest and most strategic national roads.  However, there remain many improvement schemes that are highly desirable and would generate significant economic, safety, regional growth and environmental benefits, and these schemes will be advanced as the capital investment plan funding profile permits.  These priorities were reflected in TII&rsquo;s work programme for 2016 and will continue to form the strategic framework for our national road activities in the coming years. <\/p><p> I would like to highlight two particularly positive developments.  The M17-M18 motorway PPP scheme opened for use two months earlier than expected on 27 September 2017.  This was one of three national road projects that was included in the Government&rsquo;s PPP stimulus programme.  The use of the PPP funding mechanism, with the support of the European Investment Bank, for these major national road infrastructure projects allowed us to get them started at a time when Ireland&rsquo;s capital investment capacity was greatly constrained by the fiscal crisis.<\/p><p> The second major development that I would highlight is that the contractor for the Luas cross city extension of the Green Line achieved an early handover of the tracks to the Luas operator on the weekend of 9 September.  This allowed the operator&rsquo;s driver training programme to commence on time, which is a precursor to the system coming into operation in December.  In the context of benefits realisation, the early handover of these motorway and light rail projects is a significant milestone for these complex and challenging projects. <\/p><p> We have, as requested, submitted a briefing paper which contains some detail on the delivery of national road and light rail projects under the capital investment plan, investments in asset renewals and minor roads realignment safety projects.  We are pleased that the Comptroller and Auditor General, who audited our 2016 financial statements, noted that the statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of TII as at the 31 December 2016, and of its income and expenditure for the year then ended, and that the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. <\/p><p> We will, of course, be happy to answer the committee&rsquo;s questions.  If there are any questions that we cannot answer today we will, as always, follow up with a written response. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507795200,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan.

TII has 5,500 km of network of which approximately 3,000 km is legacy roadway, which has very poorly engineered pavement structures.  We have 2,500 km of engineered pavement which is in better condition because these roads were designed and constructed to a certain standard.  We undertake condition surveys every year on the network and with that information we are able to prioritise where the funding is directed.  Various different factors are taken into account in the condition survey.  Based on the annual condition surveys, where we survey the strength of the pavement on the underlying structure and we also look for skid resistance and so on, on that information we should be spending ideally of the order of &euro;140 million annually on repaving the national road network.  Pavements last for a seven to 12 year cycle, depending on the surfacing, so TII should be working on 400 km of roadway every year. At present we are only reaching 130 km of roadway.  In monetary terms the underfunding - this is acknowledged by TII and the Department - is of the order of &euro;90 million to &euro;100 million each year, depending on the year.  One can get around underfunding in the short term, for one or two years.  When underfunding is persistent, TII will find that it will spend &euro;2 in future years to fix what &euro;1 would do today.

For example, the committee was told a couple of months ago that Ireland faces fines of approximately &euro;600 million per annum for missing our climate targets.

In the case of two of them, as Mr. Nolan explained, there was a sharing of the risk.  The more recent schemes and the more common method of public private partnership in Ireland is that the State pays the full amount to the private company.  This is what happened in our last five schemes, whereby the private sector funds, designs, builds, operates and maintains the scheme but we pay the entirety of it and there are no user charges.

I have always argued that this is something that would be useful in adding to the public debate and in gaining community support for choosing PPP as a vehicle.  I have also pointed out that there is an obligation under the public spending code that there be post-implementation evaluations of capital projects.  It applies to all capital projects but that also applies to PPPs.  Other than in the roads area, there has been little of that done.  In fairness to TII, including when it was National Roads Authority, it carries out the evaluations but they are not published.  There is an opportunity there to contribute to public debate around that by publishing at least some information in respect of it and I have made a recommendation to that effect, which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform supports but, obviously, the Department is not the commissioning authority for PPPs.  It relies on TII, the Department of Education and Skills and so on to do those exercises.<\/p> <p>  We have not done an international comparison piece around that.

I completely accept that the projections are strong, but the M3 may become an undesirable source or choice for people.  The irony is if that growth continues, it will become undesirable because the traffic has to stop somewhere, and it is going to stop at Blanchardstown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#Q03100","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507795200,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Indeed.

In that respect - things are picking up again - projects involving a lot of land in different parts of the country cannot be progressed through planning stage because the planners and An Bord Plean&aacute;la have shot down plans owing to a lack of infrastructure.  I am not talking about infrastructure under the auspices of the activation scheme which the Government has introduced for individual private sites, rather I am talking about actual physical parts of towns.  My town is one of a few in the country that have an SDZ, but no work on adjoining zoned sites can take place owing to the lack of traffic capacity in that part of the town.  I am sure that is the case in many other towns also.  Where is TII's forward-planning section in trying to progress these plans?  This ties in completely with the challenge with which the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is faced in delivering housing units and that is often lost in the debate in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  People say we need housing now and so on, but a lot of these things will never be progressed without the actual infrastructure, whether bridges or anything else.

Am I missing something?  There is a grant refund.  Is it from the local authorities?  Mr. Nolan might clarify that.  He might also clarify the successful VAT judgment which allows TII more money.  Does that apply retrospectively?  Has TII checked that?  What is the status of it?<\/p> <p>  Finally, there is the Moycullen bypass.  Maybe I will come back to that.  In summary, there is the publication of the reports, the grants-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101200002#T00500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507795200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>On the publication of reports, we will have to redact commercially sensitive information from those post-project reviews.<\/p> <p>  Second, on the refunds from local authorities, from year to year, if local authorities sell lands as was mentioned earlier, that money gets remitted back to TII because the money would have been provided by the State in the first place.

This includes the use of rail as opposed to road, the linking up of our ports, funding opportunities under the TEN-T programme and so forth.  One example would be the linking of Waterford Port with Foynes and Limerick ports and the process for doing this.

I went so far as to write to the tourist board, and it agreed, yet I cannot get Transport Infrastructure Ireland to agree to put up the sign.  There is even a sign produced by Kilkenny County Council.  Not erecting it is excluding a man who is running a hotel and catering business.  His case should be heard.

The Irish College of General Practitioners wishes the committee the very best in the successful completion of its job.  I am accompanied by Dr. Karena Hanley and we have been requested to present the Irish general practice perspective on crisis pregnancy focusing on the health of the woman, with no distinction being drawn between physical and mental health in the context of the eighth amendment of the Constitution.<br\/><br\/>As family doctors, general practitioners, GPs, are familiar with the reproductive health-care challenges facing Irish women.  Irish GPs provide antenatal care to Irish women.  For the majority of pregnant women, antenatal care and support before 20 weeks' gestation is provided by GPs alone.  After this date, GPs provide shared antenatal care with hospital colleagues in obstetrics and midwifery.  When a pregnancy is unwanted, Irish GPs support and provide evidence-based care for women through this difficult experience, which will be articulated in this submission.  Irish GPs also provide high-quality contraception health care to Irish women and men.  Thus, the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, is well placed to understand the concerns and fears facing Irish women regarding reproductive health care.<br\/><br\/>The ICGP has been asked by the committee to focus on the health of the woman, with no distinction being drawn between physical and mental health, in the context of the eighth amendment of the Irish Constitution.  The World Health Organisation definition of &quot;health&quot; since 1948 states:<\/p><blockquote>Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmit<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">y.<\/font><\/blockquote> <p>Evidence-based management of crisis pregnancy, with a focus on the effects on the health of the woman, is included in this evidence-based submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan O'Shea"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507813200,"counter":944,"content":"<p>A crisis pregnancy is a pregnancy which is neither planned nor desired by the woman concerned and which represents a personal crisis for her.  Crisis pregnancy can affect women of any reproductive age, social group or area of the country.  Crisis pregnancies are common and constitute up to 13% of all pregnancies.  While most of these pregnancies result in parenthood, approximately 14% end in miscarriage, 21% with abortion and 1% with adoption.  It remains the case that more than 3,000 women travel from this country every year to obtain abortion elsewhere.  Of concern is the rising number of more than 1,000 each year who obtain abortifacient pills online and administer them personally and without medical supervision.<\/p> <p>  How do we prevent crisis pregnancy?  Effective contraception is key.  GPs try to be proactive in the provision of available contraception to all women who are sexually active.  Our colleagues in the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme support a range of educational programmes, research, counselling and medical services.  The Irish Family Planning Association also provides excellent contraceptive care.  Despite all of the efforts of the Government, educational initiatives and services, crisis pregnancy cannot always be prevented.  Most GPs witness and take care of crisis pregnancy on a common basis.  We know that abortion rates are lowest in health systems where contraceptive services are most readily available.  As the committee heard yesterday, however, there are still barriers to contraceptive services in Ireland, in particular the cost and misplaced concerns around confidentiality, especially among younger women.  The eighth amendment does not actually impact upon contraception and emergency contraception management for Irish women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karena Hanley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507813200,"counter":945,"content":"<p>We will move on to the management of crisis pregnancy as experienced, in particular, by members of the college and general practitioners nationally.   To help outline the typical crisis pregnancy scenario, we outline in our submission a typical anonymised vignette.  Sandra is 38 years of age and presents to her GP.  She has three children, but separated from her husband three weeks ago as he had become increasingly abusive towards her and her children.  The GP has become increasingly concerned about Sandra's isolation and lack of supports.  Sandra comes to see her GP and states that she missed her period two weeks ago.  She thinks she may be pregnant but she has not done a pregnancy test herself.  She looks concerned and is anxious.  Before the GP performs a pregnancy test, she explores Sandra's feelings and asks if she would be happy if she found out that she was pregnant.<\/p><p>Sandra bursts into tears.  The general practitioner, GP, listens to her many concerns and explains that no matter what happens, the practice will be there to support Sandra in the consultation and beyond.  The GP proceeds to check a urine sample and it confirms she is pregnant.  Sandra looks despondent and says she does not want to be pregnant.<br\/><br\/>Every crisis pregnancy is different.  Reasons a pregnancy is unwanted are personal and unique to each individual, circumstances and the person's family.  However, the approach taken by the doctor to managing crisis pregnancy is the same.  Firstly, the pregnancy is confirmed.  As the vignette outlines, the GP cannot assume all pregnancies are always wanted.  GPs are well placed to sensitively inquire about the woman's feelings and confirm the pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>Second, we proceed to non-directive counselling and discussion of options.  The next step in management is to support the woman to reach the best decision for her, providing a safe reflective space for her to do so.  The main goals involved include maintaining trust, helping the woman formulate a clear definition of the problems and establishing the goals of management so that the crisis can be resolved.  This involves non-directive, non-judgmental, compassionate, empathetic listening, sometimes over two or more consultations over the course of weeks.  There is a legal obligation on those providing pregnancy counselling in Ireland, including general practitioners, to discuss all options in a non-directive manner where a woman wants information on abortion.<br\/><br\/>Third, there are three options available to the woman, continuing with the pregnancy, abortion and adoption, although the latter is relatively rarely chosen.  A doctor has an ethical obligation not to allow his or her personal moral standards to influence treatment of patients.  Where the doctor has a conscientious objection to a course of action, he or she must explain this to the patient and provide the names of other doctors available to the patient in a timely manner.  Effective communication in a crisis situation demands time, considerable patience and careful thought.  The GP must enable the woman to reach an informed decision, to minimise emotional disturbance, whatever decision is made, and to lessen the risk of further unwanted pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>In general practice, we hope and believe that women find space, are listened to, and can share, explore and address their concerns in a familiar setting with a physician who is very familiar to them in most cases.  Supporting this personalised care is a core value of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, so that these consultations, and indeed any other consultations involving the woman and the process of decision making, are all undertaken in a non-directional and supportive process.  The role of the GP and practice nurse is chiefly concerned with the provision of support, information, and clear commitment to follow-up care in the practice.  Sometimes specialist counselling is required.  For example, if a woman is younger, has poorer support structures or has an active, significant mental illness, she may benefit from specialist counselling services.  In this case, Irish GPs may recommend a specialist, accredited, counselling service, which offers accurate information.  These services are funded by the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme, and locations and descriptions can be found on <i>www.positiveoptions.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>If a woman chooses to continue her pregnancy, the GP will continue to provide compassionate antenatal care to the woman, ensuring adequate supports are present and addressing the important issue of postpartum contraception.<br\/><br\/>In the clinical vignette we have described, Sandra chooses to travel to the UK for an abortion.  GPs cannot actually refer to or make an appointment at a clinic in the UK on behalf of a woman who chooses an abortion.  We may provide a copy of the patient's medical records to the patient.  GPs would also encourage women to return to the practice after having an abortion if they have any concerns.  GPs would also discuss post-abortion contraception.  Irish GPs may need to consider a dating ultrasound if the dates of the pregnancy are uncertain.  Any GP who has a conscientious objection must refer the woman in a timely manner to another colleague.  Abortion is a relatively very safe medical procedure.  The ICGP understands that an increasing proportion of women will purchase online hormonal abortifacient medications.  In these instances, it may or may not become known to their GP in subsequent consultations.  There is clearly increased use of illegal abortifacients, both from anecdotal evidence from GPs and objective measures such as customs seizures, and a recent paper which suggests that more than 5,000 women requested abortion pills in this way between January 2010 and December 2015.  The trend is increasing significantly and rapidly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101200002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507813200,"counter":947,"content":"<p>I will talk about the impact on the health of the woman.  I will start with travel.  Reflecting on the vignette, one can understand the psychological cost to that woman, the stress, the loneliness and the psychological burden of travelling to procure an abortion.  There is also a physical risk to women who, as they travel, do not have access to post-abortion services that are available in the country where it was performed.  There are also logistical difficulties and financial costs.  Crisis pregnancy can have a profound effect on the woman's partner and wider family, but for this presentation we have focused on the woman only.  The logistics of travel also mean that women travelling from this country tend to have later abortions and a higher proportion of surgical interventions.  There are also women who cannot travel, including those who are disabled, without financial means, socially isolated and asylum seekers, who cannot leave this country for abortion.<\/p> <p>  We would like to bring to the committee's attention the harm that can be done by inaccurate information from unlicensed, unaccredited counselling agents, who sometimes give distressing and incorrect information.<\/p> <p>  I will address the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  It allows for lawful abortion when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  Most of the 25 terminations conducted under this legislation are performed by our obstetric colleagues and GPs are not involved, but we are in involved where the risk to life is a risk of suicide.  The clinical pathway in this context requires referral from the GP to local general psychiatry services.  Two psychiatrists and one obstetrician then need to agree that an abortion is lawful under that Act.  Very few cases have been performed under this arrangement and the experience of Miss Y needs to be considered.  This arrangement tends to lead to delays in accessing termination of the pregnancy and, if the second psychiatrist is outside the location, this adds to the difficulty.  Criminalisation needs to be considered.  This relates to the increasing numbers of women who procure abortion pills online.  They may be criminalised with the potential of a 14 year prison sentence.  This may prevent them from reporting to Irish doctors, which could seriously impact their health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karena Hanley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507813200,"counter":948,"content":"<p>To summarise and conclude, the ICGP is thankful that the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution invites our input.  Abortion is a divisive, difficult and polarising topic.  Irish general practitioners have debated this theme internally within college, and similarly to the broader population, we have witnessed conflicting opinions, concerns and beliefs among our own group.  The constitutional criminalisation of abortion in Ireland has made this a more difficult issue to discuss in public.  It has also made a significantly more difficult issue when attempting to provide care in the care setting.  However, crisis pregnancy is a large-scale reality facing Irish women.  Many Irish women choose to access abortion services, which we must deal with more effectively as a society.  The eighth amendment clearly raises difficult ethical and moral issues for the public and health care providers.  We hope that the ICGP has informed on how crisis pregnancy can impact the health of the woman, and how GPs currently care for such women.  We outlined the impact on the health of women, as requested by the committee.

If a woman had the slightest smidgen of an irregular cycle she was all right.  Later on we were allowed to make condoms available to people as long as they were married.  Now we can talk about termination but we are not allowed to make a referral.  From a medical perspective, there is objective evidence that abortion is a relatively safe medical procedure but the experience to which we subject women who travel for abortion is something else and it is traumatic to consider any sister, mother or daughter travelling to a UK abortion clinic in these circumstances.

There is the anxiety and stress associated with trying to find money to organise the travel.  It is often a real issue for these women.

There is no doubt, from the perspective of the ICGP, that members of the college do have the necessary skills.  A question mark lies over our total capacity, but as I said earlier, this does not particularly relate to capacity in this area but rather all capacity in general practice.  The country is quite short of general practitioners and very short of practice nurses.  It is a capacity rather than skills problem.  It is a relatively straightforward deficit to correct in the context of whole system management.<\/p> <p>  On the question of whether there is an impact on the GP concerned, we understand that at times this is actually quite stressful for individual GPs.  That is reflected in our system of peer-reviewed support, which is largely delivered through the CME network and is run by a series of tutors.  It involves a majority of GPs reflecting on a monthly basis.  Challenging and problem case management is something that we often discuss, and certainly this area of care is often reflected in those discussions.<\/p><p>Individually, general practitioners can be quite challenged and exercised, and occasionally, almost wounded by the experience.

How can we move forward to set a standard for crisis pregnancy counselling?  Rogue agencies have done a disservice to the country in terms of having information providers that are unbiased and give positive experiences.  Rogue agencies have left women in a fearful state.  Women are afraid to reach out and ask for help and advice.  We must ensure that women get the real advice and counselling that they deserve in that situation.  I hope that the delegation can provide a description of how GPs are trained to give non-directive and impartial information to women.  Please explain how the GP experience and training could be expanded to inform a national regulatory framework for pregnancy counselling to prevent rogue agencies from manipulating women.  <\/p> <p>  In his presentation Dr. O'Shea described the approach taken by GPs when their patients experience a crisis pregnancy.  I was heartened by the description.  The approach is positive, professional and compassionate.  I am concerned, despite the description of best practice, that does not mean that every woman gets support of such high quality from their GPs.  Based on anecdotal evidence that I have heard over the years I want to know how can a best practice model be imbedded into the national GP network?  How can we monitor whether the model has been adhered to?  Is there a mechanism in place to monitor what women experience when they approach their GP with a crisis pregnancy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101200002#M00900","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507813200,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>It is not our position to comment on rogue agencies and I might see if Dr. O'Shea wants to reply.  I want to talk about counselling in crisis pregnancy.  We have clear guidelines for such counselling.  Our published literature is available to everyone on the ICGP website, not just members.<\/p> <p>  In terms of counselling, the three main goals of the process are as follows.  First, establish rapport and gain the trust of the woman in crisis.  Second, help her formulate a clear definition of the problem, which can be very interesting.  Sometimes perspective can change when the matter is talked through, which is important to note.  Third, enable her to establish goals for the management and resolution of the crisis.  Our publication goes on to describe how one gives the woman space, and one gives her information about all of the alternatives that are available.  There is a list of websites at the back of the publication where a lot more information can be gathered.  One gives her the opportunity to explore the implications of each of the options.  We give the woman the opportunity to assess her feelings, wishes and circumstances, and also further supports.  Often one will have  us of the website.  IT development in general practice is very well advanced in Ireland and most of us will be able to show a woman where to go for assistance on the website.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of how the best practice model can be more uniformly distributed, that is always a challenge of medical education.  There are multi-factoral ways in which we handle this matter in all areas.  It is through our monthly publication forum, email shots and elearning platforms.  All GPs have a requirement to gather continual professional development points.  For example, the reading of our guide can be recorded as CPD points.  There are ways.  If it is felt that there is a need to promote this area then the college is in a very good position to do so. <\/p> <p>  Does Dr. O'Shea wish to answer any of the other questions?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101200002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karena Hanley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507813200,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>Senator Ruane asked the very important question of how can we know whether every woman and her partner gets the best care in these circumstances.  It is not all right to have fuzzy nice thoughts about that.  It is an important question but, to some extent, it is a difficult question to answer with a high level of satisfaction.  In general terms the considerations are as follows.  We do always pay attention in our activities and focus in on when patients do not get best care in a variety of different care settings.  This is a special care setting and it has got an additional complexity around it but it is part of what we do in the college.  Quality is built into our key core message and it is the foundation message of the college.<\/p> <p>  We do understand that patients get suboptimal care if the doctor is unwell so we have an active health and practice programme, run through the ICGP, and have done so for many years.  The programme is innovative.  We do look to the health of general practitioners to make sure that they are well.  If the GP is stressed or anxious he or she is more likely to be peremptory, dismissive, not in good form or otherwise receptive.  That is one plank that protects patients.<\/p> <p>  We have features of practice.  We have a practice management programme where patient feedback is built in.  As part of that we encourage general practitioners and advise them, as part of good practice, to solicit and ask for feedback from their patients.  We recognise that those in this patient group are especially vulnerable.  It is difficult to conduct themselves as enfranchised consumers given the experience that they going through.  Simple feedback on its own almost certainly is not enough.  In the college, during the past year, we have formally sought to see what are the additional ways that we can have patients or, really, people involved in our internal college processes.  That is an area that has been highlighted by the college's board.  Again, we hope that women and their partners who have gone through this experience may find a voice within college in terms of that.  It is important for the integrity of the college.  <\/p> <p>  There are other pieces that are relevant.  Again, in all areas of care we are required to conduct practice audit.

What about a woman who has a clotting disorder but is otherwise fit and healthy?  Obviously, a relatively simple, safe procedure such as a medically induced abortion or surgical abortion in the early stages would then have an added level of complexity.  I ask the witnesses, as medical people, to tease out the matter.  Can they explain how the barrier to GPs being unable to refer and send a woman carrying a photocopied chart under her arm that could be left on a plane affects such a case?  People often go to their doctors with something on their minds but completely forget to say what is wrong with them due to the stress of the situation.<\/p><p>The process of teasing out information may be affected and the information may not be disseminated properly to the practitioner abroad, for whatever reason.

From the perspective of general practice, we appreciate that whether or not to have greater availability of abortion in this country is a very important issue.  Many general practitioners believe the issue of contraception is arguably even more important and a critical part of the long-term solution.  I concur with Deputy Fitzpatrick that the stories of women who regret having had an abortion are quite important.<\/p> <p>  There is an evidence base on this issue, in particular a study conducted in the United States called the turnaway study, which looked at psychological sequelae in women who had or were denied a termination.  Its methodology is a little complex.  Two sample groups of women were recruited into the study from a variety of centres across the United States, and that has to be interpreted accordingly.  The women took part in the study close to the time of their making a decision on a termination.  Some proceeded to have a termination and others were denied a termination on grounds.  They were then followed for a period of five to seven years and the psychological impact of their experience was measured and examined.  That is not the exact issue raised by the Deputy but it is quite close to it.  The turnaway study found that the level of psychological symptoms and anxiety was greater in the women who proceeded to parenthood than in the group who had a termination.  It was also found that over a period of years the level of psychological consequence was equal between the two groups.  That is international peer-reviewed research that to some extent speaks to the issue raised by the Deputy.  However, we believed and were keen that the evidence we were asked to present to the committee should focus on the health of the woman, with no distinction being drawn between physical and mental health.  The focus of our presentation related to the process of unplanned pregnancy as we experience it in our surgeries and the immediate as opposed to longer-term consequences of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101200002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan O'Shea"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507813200,"counter":1041,"content":"<p>There are consequences for every action in life and there will always be a certain number of women who regret their decision and it will always be part of our role to support and help them.
