Much is said about the needs of young people in Irish society, but when it comes to young people returning to Ireland, either to work or further their education, having had to spend a period abroad because of economic failures, it seems there is very little sympathy for their plight.  We see this when young drivers are hit with massive car insurance premiums because they have been out of the country for a period and are not able to indicate a continuous period of claims-free driving.  <\/p> <p>In the area of education it seems the problem is particularly acute.  I have come across a couple of cases recently, one of which involves an Irish person who studied in Ireland, obtained her primary degree and then moved to Japan to teach English for five years.  She now wishes to return and study for a master's degree, but it is proposed to hit her with the full fee, not the fee an Irish person would normally expect to pay.  What is the reason for this?  According to the rules, she has not been resident in Ireland for three years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I know of another case in Galway where a carpenter had to go abroad to work for the past number of years.  He has therefore not been tax resident in Ireland for four or five years.  His son is thinking of coming home from America to study in Ireland and he has to contemplate the prospect of paying a full international fee.  This is simply not fair.  It does not seem to be clear what arrangements operate.  It seems to differ between colleges.  In some places, there is the prospect of people who have been resident in Ireland for three of the past five years getting the benefit of the free fees scheme, although even then they have to pay a student service charge which has continued to increase in recent years.  People who are European citizens and who have not been resident in Ireland for three of the past five years get an EU-level fee, which is higher.  People who are outside of the EU, including Irish people abroad who have not been resident in Ireland or the EU for the past five years, in some cases face the prospect of a full international fee.<\/p><p>This is no way to treat the Irish diaspora.  This is no way to attract Ireland's best and brightest home.  This is no way for Ireland to develop its economic future with the assistance of its people and its young people in particular.  I need hardly remind the Government that it is not the fault of these young people that they had to go abroad either to better their experience so that they could bring a better skillset back home or out of simple economic necessity.  It is not their fault their parents had to go abroad, leaving their families, friends and homes behind them so that they could earn a living and provide for their families.  It is absolutely wrong that young people, whether coming back themselves or whose families are still abroad but they wish to come back and study in Ireland, would be deprived of the same access to the free fees system that an Irish citizen resident in Ireland would enjoy.  <\/p><p>This is not the way to treat our diaspora.  There must be ways to deal with it.  In many ways, third-level education is seen as an income earner for Irish colleges.  Bringing in students from abroad is seen as a way of bringing dollars into the country.  Colleges spend increasing amounts of time and energy attracting people from abroad to study in the country because it is an income earner for Ireland.  This should not be done in the case of people who are Irish citizens.  They should not be exploited in that way.  They should have access to the free fees system.  If the argument being made is that they or their parents have not been paying tax in Ireland for the past number of years, at the very least it should be possible to address their situation through some kind of a student loan scheme, so that they are not in any way disadvantaged when they want to return to Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#A00400","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The Senator has made his point.

I am taking this Commencement Matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who cannot be here this morning.  Let me start by explaining the background to the current free fees scheme.<\/p> <p>Under the terms of the Department's free fees schemes, the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study which are a minimum of two years duration in an approved institution.  The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, meet the nationality clause of the scheme in their own right and, for study at level 6, 7 and 8 in universities and level 8 in institutes of technology, have been ordinarily resident in an EU-EEA-Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third-level course.<\/p> <p>Where students do not meet the eligibility requirements for free tuition fees, including the residency requirement, they are liable to pay the appropriate EU or non-EU tuition fee as determined by the third-level institution.  These institutions are autonomous bodies and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees scheme is therefore a matter for the relevant institution.<\/p> <p>Due to concerns in respect of the fact that in some cases the higher non-EU fee was being charged to students who hold EU-EEA-Swiss nationality but who did not meet the residency clause for free fees, the former Minister for Education and Skills requested that the higher education institutions charge the more moderate EU fee to such students who have completed at least five academic years of study at primary or post-primary level in Ireland, EU-EEA countries or Switzerland and who commence their first undergraduate course of study in an approved institution here.  This position took effect from the academic year 2014-2015 onwards.<\/p> <p>The particular concern related to people who for occupational or economic reasons have had to move abroad, requiring them to take their children out of the Irish education system in the process.  If, after a period, they return to live in Ireland, in some cases their children may not have met the residency criteria necessary to qualify for free fees.  In addition, they may then have found themselves doubly disadvantaged by being charged the higher non-EU rate of fee designed for international students rather than the more moderate EU rate.  The Department was anxious to ensure that children who move out of the Irish education system in such circumstances and subsequently return would not be so doubly disadvantaged by being charged the higher non-EU rate of fee.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#B00400","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  As always with these matters, it is a prepared response.  It is not the Minister of State's fault that this is not nearly comprehensive enough to address the nature of my query.  What of the student who is an Irish citizen who has been outside of the EU?  It is quite clear from the Minister of State's script that it is only in the case where they have been getting their second-level education in the EU that they would qualify for the more moderate EU fee, as the Minister of State described it.  What of people returning from abroad to do a Master's degree?  If they were in the Irish system, they would proceed to free fees on the Master's programme.  They are being deprived of that.  The Government needs to rethink this whole area and to look at the injustice being done to Irish citizens returning from abroad who wish to study and who should be availing of that study at the same rate as an Irish person who was educated and studying at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#B00500","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I again draw the Senator's attention to the main conditions of the scheme, which include the condition that students are first-time undergraduates.

I am aware that one area of her responsibilities is rural development and planning for the future of rural Ireland.  In that regard, my motion is pertinent.  It concerns the Government's future plans to maximise the number of farming families in this country over the long term at a time when all in the agriculture industry are very excited about the end of the milk quota regime.  This is a very positive development and it should be portrayed as such.  We have projected figures for future dairy production, future dairy herd numbers and future employment, both on-farm and off-farm.  They are very positive.  We are all very much aware of the difficulties which will arise in respect of the fluctuation in milk prices but, it is hoped that everyone working in the industry, working with the financial institutions, the dairy co-operatives and the dairy processors, will be able to plan for the rainy days as well as the sunshine in that regard.<\/p> <p>My question goes a little beyond that however.  One of the disappointing projections in respect of the positive milk quota news is that over the next number of years it is expected that the number of people in dairy farming will fall.  The scale of it will be much bigger but we may well in ten or 15 years time have fewer dairy farmers in this country.  In respect of not just dairy farmers but farmers right across the spectrum, and in particular farming families, is it not time that we as a nation and the Minister of State and her Government colleagues would try to put a figure on the number of people they want on the land of Ireland in five, ten, 15 and 20 years time?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Bradford:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I accept that is a difficult thing to do but it is something we should plan for.  It is not something which we have previously planned.<\/p><p>Clearly we plan for the future of agriculture, we plan for the future of production and we plan for expansion.  Rural development since Ireland joined what was then known as the EEC in 1973 has been very positive from the production and agri-industry points of view.  However, the number of people on the land and farms of this country have dropped quite dramatically.  Much of that is understandable but some arises from choices taken by various Ministers and Departments down the years.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State, and her colleagues across the agricultural portfolio, must make a decision over the course of the next year.  Who knows, it may be her party and others again who will be in Government.  In the next five or six years we must decide to set a minimum target for the number of people who will farm the lands of Ireland, and farming our townlands, parishes and counties.  Every farming family adds to the economic infrastructure of the country and adds very significantly to the social infrastructure of rural Ireland.  One could, in theory, greatly expand Irish agriculture while simultaneously see the number of farmers and farming families drop by 50%, which would not be a desirable outcome.<\/p><p>It has been great to see an increase in the number of students attending agricultural colleges  over the past number of years.  It shows young people want to be farmers again.  We must state to them that we are trying to maximise options, from a policy perspective, in order that they can remain in farming.  The dairy industry, no matter how progressively it expands and we all wish it well, cannot employ every single interested farmer on this island.  Therefore, we must look at other agricultural sectors.  We must look again at pig and sheep production which have big problems and there are also problems in the beef sector.  While I use the term \"micro sector\" I am not being dismissive.  We must look at the micro and organic sectors and do more work on a REPs-type expansion, etc.  <\/p><p>I do not have a solution for the Minister of State and I do not think anybody does.  However, I seek to learn her thinking, and that of her colleagues in Government, on this issue.  It would be helpful if we could ensure there is a strong long-term future for the maximum number of farming families which would be good for farming.  It would also be good for rural Ireland and the community life which is the social fabric of this country and the economy.  I seek her initial observations.  I appreciate that this is a medium to long-term issue but it is one we need to work towards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#B00800","speaker":"1189","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and understand his proposal.  To be fair to the Minister, I do not think he would necessarily disagree with him in any way.  Forward planning is always desirable, whether it is in agriculture or any other sector of the economy.  Anticipating what is going to happen over the coming years is desirable.<\/p> <p>Yesterday marked one of the biggest changes in the history of Irish agriculture.  With the Senator's permission, perhaps I might skip to the policy part of my answer.  It is quite detailed and I am conscious that I shall use up my time with same.<\/p> <p>The CSO census of agriculture data shows that the number of farm families has remained reasonably stable between 2000 and 2010 which was when the last  census took place, accounting for around 141,500 family farms in 2000, to almost 140,000 in 2010.  I shall skip party of my reply because the Senator is interested in hearing about policy.   <\/p> <p>During the period 2009 to 2013, the Department operated an annual scheme for new entrants to dairying whereby successful applicants were allocated a milk quota of up to 200,000 litres at no charge.  The scheme was aimed at introducing the best and brightest into the sector and allocated some 70 million litres of quota to over 400 new entrants.  Last year, the Department built on the scheme by operating an Exchequer-funded knowledge transfer programme referred to as cash plan 2014.  Over 600 recent entrants participated in this programme which was designed to emphasise the importance of farm planning, cashflow and the true cost of producing a litre of milk, and how to manage the factors that influence this cost.<\/p> <p>The next item is agri-taxation measures.  One of the policy objectives behind many of the recently introduced agri-taxation measures, in budgets 2012 to 2015, was to encourage farming as a career for young people.  Measures were introduced to increase land mobility, assist succession and the transfer of farms to younger farmers.  They included new stock relief incentive for farm partnerships; reduced stamp duty on agricultural land transactions; 100% stock relief on income tax for certain young trained farmers; a stamp duty exemption on transfers of land to young trained farmers; and establishing a new register of farm partnerships to address land mobility and smooth intergenerational succession.<\/p> <p>The new &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector.  One of the issues which strongly emerged from the consultation process was the need to support young farmers and intergenerational renewal in the sector.  Accordingly, there are a number of measures within the RDP that directly address this issue.  For example, the substantial new agri-environment scheme, which is commonly known as GLAS, gives continued strong support for farmers in areas of natural constraint, support for knowledge transfer, and targeted support for the beef sector via the highly innovative beef data and genomics programme.  Also, &euro;395 million has been allocated to provide support for a wide range of capital investments on Irish farms across various sectors.  A general rate of 40% aid is available to farmers under TAMS II, with an increased rate of 60% aid available for farmers under 40 years of age.<\/p> <p>A further RDP measure that incorporates a targeting of the age profile of Irish farmers is the support for set-up costs of farm partnerships.  Supporting farm partnerships in this way will provide a further channel of entry for young farmers.  Under Pillar 1, young farmers will benefit from the both the young farmer scheme and the national reserve.  Relevant young farmers will also be eligible to apply under the second phase of the national reserve to be given new entitlements or be given a top-up on the value of existing entitlements.  Applications will be made available in early April 2015.<\/p> <p>This Government has had a continuous focus on the strategic development of the agriculture and food sector.  This strategic focus has borne fruit as, through the implementation of Food Harvest 2020, the value of primary production has almost met its 33% target, agri-food exports have grown by 27% and gross value added or GVA has risen by 29%.  These figures have been taken from the 2012 data which is the latest available.  Notwithstanding the substantive progress achieved on the smart green  growth vision of Food Harvest 2020, the continually changing and challenging global environment means that the sector must be kept under continuous review if we are to sustainably expand production and gain maximum value from the new and existing opportunities.  To this end, a new 2025 Agri-Food Strategy Committee has been appointed which will report back to Government by the end of June with its key strategic recommendations and actions for the sector up to 2025.<\/p> <p>Finally, a good indication for the successful operation of future family farms lies in the tremendous increase in the numbers attending agricultural colleges.  The numbers involved have almost doubled since 2008.  Teagasc, typically, enrols around 3,500 new learners annually in its education programmes with about 5,000 participating in its shorter continuous professional development courses.  Teagasc expects that the demand for full-time courses will be sustained at current levels for the sustainable future.  This is concrete proof that the Government's focus on supporting farm families, through its strategic vision and a range of measures, schemes and development programmes, is the best way of sustaining the numbers of traditional family farms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#C00200","speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","time":1427967000,"counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#C00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I am glad that my commencement matter has been selected for today.

The local youth caf&eacute; which was recently opened and only through the voluntary efforts of many in the local community, was burgled of its televisions and other equipment which had been generously donated and paid for by the local community through fund raising.  Local businesses, including hairdressers, barber shops and pubs - there was a burglary last night in a local licensed premises - have been burgled and there is considerable fear and anxiety in the community.  The garda&iacute; do their best and we all have a good relationship with the local superintendent who does his best.  However, we do not have a full-time Garda station.  I have been asking for a full-time Garda station for a long time.  The number of garda&iacute; tend to vary between three and four for this village and clearly this is not sufficient.

The Minister has no function in the matter.  This allocation of resources is constantly monitored by the Garda Commissioner and her senior management in the context of demographics, crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a district,divisional and regional level, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources.<\/p> <p>Duleek Garda station is in the Meath Garda division.  The Minister is aware of concerns about incidents of burglary in rural Ireland and in particular its effects on the most vulnerable in our society, in particular, the elderly.  The Minister finds it difficult to fathom how anyone could perpetrate such cowardly crimes against our elderly citizens.  Operation Fiacla was set up to combat instances of burglary and related criminality.  This operation has proven to be successful nationally, with several thousand arrests and prosecutions for burglary offences.<\/p> <p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to work closely with communities through Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and other organisations, to provide expert crime prevention advice and support to communities.  The Garda commitment to this approach was underlined in the new guidelines for communities wishing to set up community crime prevention schemes which were launched by the Commissioner and the then Minister for Justice and Equality in 2013.  That work is ongoing with respect to the establishment and revitalisation, where appropriate, of a number of community alert schemes as part of overall crime prevention strategies.  As I have stated, decisions relating to the provision and allocation of Garda resources, including personnel and vehicles, are a matter for the Garda Commissioner in light of her identified operational demands.<\/p> <p>The Minister has been informed by the Commissioner's office that 278 garda&iacute; are assigned to the Meath division, of whom four are assigned to Duleek Garda station which is a sub-district within the district of Ashbourne.  When members attached to Duleek Garda station are not on duty, the sub-district is patrolled by garda&iacute; from Laytown Garda station and assisted, as required by the district headquarters station at Ashbourne.  Local Garda resources are augmented by the divisional traffic unit, community policing units, detective unit and the regional support unit, where necessary, to meet the service demand.  Residents in Duleek are assured of a 24-hour response to calls for assistance.  All non-999 or 112 calls are diverted to Ashbourne Garda station, which is open and manned on a 24-hour basis.  All 999 or 112 calls are received at the divisional control room at Navan Garda station and passed to the appropriate patrols on duty.<\/p> <p>Last September this Government oversaw the first recruitment of new garda&iacute; since 2009.  The Garda College was reopened for new recruitments and the Government is committed to not letting it close again.  To date, 300 new recruits have entered the Garda College, with the first of these to join the force as sworn members in May.  The Minister is happy to confirm that she has received sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, for the recruitment of a further 250 new garda&iacute; over the coming months.  She promised seamless ongoing recruitment and she is delivering on this promise.  The additional recruitment will bring to 550 the total number of garda&iacute; that will have been recruited by this Government between September 2014 and October 2015.  It signifies the determination of the Government and the Minister to deliver an effective, responsive police service to protect our communities.<\/p> <p>Responsibility for the efficient deployment of Garda vehicles in each division is assigned to the divisional officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances.  The Senator will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.  The Minister recently secured a further &euro;10 million for investment in the Garda fleet of which &euro;7 million was made available in 2014.  This funding brings the total investment in the Garda fleet in 2014 to &euro;11 million.  The remaining &euro;3 million is being made available for the purchase and fit-out of additional Garda vehicles in 2015.  In October 2014 an order was placed for 370 new vehicles.  These vehicles were delivered towards the end of 2014 and following fit-out are being deployed in accordance with the Garda Commissioner's operational requirements.  The Minister has been advised that the needs of the area referred to will be fully considered when new Garda vehicles are being allocated.<\/p> <p>The Government, the Minister and the Garda Commissioner are committed to putting in place the necessary resources, systems and operations to support the effective delivery of the best possible policing and security services not just for Duleek and the Meath division but for all of our communities across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#D00200","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister of State to inform the Minister of the details of the situation in County Meath.  The Garda division based in Ashbourne covers the area from the Kilcock bridge on the Meath-Kildare border up to the outskirts of Drogheda, across to Laytown, including Stamullen and Duleek and almost over to Navan and including the Rathfeigh area.  It also includes the busy N2 road which is also the scene of much crime.  If there is a burglary or an incident down in Dunboyne, the garda&iacute; from Laytown are driving down there to try to catch the criminals.  The other night a shop was robbed in Dunshaughlin.  The same people then drove up to Duleek.  It seems to me that the garda&iacute; are chasing around the place looking for these criminals.  They are doing their very best and I fully support them but they need more support.  It is not acceptable that a garda from Laytown must drive to Dunboyne.  One would not ask a garda from Blanchardstown to drive to Drogheda but it is exactly the same distance.  This situation needs to change.<\/p> <p>There was a separate Garda division for east Meath to cover just Laytown, Duleek and Stamullen but this division was abolished under Commissioner Callinan when this Government came into office.

My request is to ask the Minister for Health to sit down with the parents of the narcolepsy victims, the parents of the children who have contracted this terrible affliction and lifelong disease as a result of a State-sponsored vaccination programme.  I cannot understand why the Minister cannot meet them at the earliest opportunity as this situation has been ongoing for five years.  It is incumbent on the Minister to sit down with the parents.

It is bad enough that has happened.  It is a terrible tragedy.  However, it compounds the problem and adds insult to injury to refuse to meet the parents and to live up to our responsibilities and obligations to the children affected, to support them now and for the rest of their lives.  I am appalled to report to the House that families have been threatened by elements within the Department and the HSE that if they countenance legal action the meagre supports available to them will be withdrawn.  Who is representing that position?  It is certainly not our position.  Who would dare to do that to a child?<\/p><p>I predict that the State is sleepwalking itself into the nightmare of a queue of protracted High Court legal cases.  The parents and children to whom I refer do not want to go to the High Court but the HSE and the Department of Health are now washing their hands of the matter and they have referred it to the State Claims Agency.  The latter body never seems to want to discuss a matter and to settle it, it favours litigation.  Time and again we have seen children wheeled out on \"Six One News\" after four or five and up to ten years in court.  Instead of supporting children and spending the money to help them and support them in their lives with medical care, education and quality of life, the State would rather pay millions to barristers to drag things out for a decade.  Very often by the time the help and compensation comes it is useless and pointless and more damage has been done.<\/p><p>The powers that be must intervene because we cannot have children dragged through the courts unnecessarily.  There is no need for that.  We administered the vaccine, which was a blanket one rather than a targeted one.  We made a second strategic error when the HSE indemnified GlaxoSmithKline from any responsibility, which landed the full burden on taxpayers and the State.  The liability has been established beyond dispute.  We have a responsibility and a moral obligation to the families affected, instead of dragging children through the courts and running up a bill of tens of millions for taxpayers over years.  More than 70 cases have now been filed and the number could reach 100.  I am ashamed to say the State has any hand, act or part in this approach and strategy.  Why are we going to the State Claims Agency with the matter?  There is nothing in dispute.  In some instances all the parents and children want is, for example, a medical card so that they do not have to worry about the cost of medical card; education supports and lifelong assistance.  This is a lifelong affliction, a burden from which they will never be free.  Had they contracted swine flu they would have recovered by now.  This was a terrible mistake.  We should learn from our mistakes.  This is the hepatitis C scandal ready to play out all over again.  We should not add to the trauma and distress of the families and children.  We all know the terrible burden it would be if it was any of our children.  I implore that the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, would meet with the parents support group, SOUND, at the earliest juncture to nip this in the bud and to bring common sense to the situation instead of resorting to the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#D00400","speaker":"1143","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Whelan for raising this very important issue.

Senator Whelan will understand that I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and I will undertake to pass on the Senator's concerns about meeting the support group.  Senator Whelan provides me with an opportunity to update the House on this matter.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has consistently acknowledged the impact narcolepsy has, both physically and emotionally, on the lives of those affected and on their families.  He is aware of 73 people with narcolepsy who received the Pandemrix vaccine.  They can experience excessive daytime sleepiness; sudden and temporary loss of muscle tone, intense, vivid and sometimes terrifying hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.  Dealing day-to-day with this illness affects not just their lives, but also those of their entire family.<\/p><p>Immunisation is a simple, safe and effective way of protecting people against certain diseases.  Immunisation against infectious disease has saved more lives than any other public health intervention.  In spite of the obvious benefits that come from vaccination there can be serious adverse outcomes for some people.  The priority for the Minister for Health, and the priority of the HSE, is that individuals and families affected in an adverse way by vaccinations receive appropriate health care and supports.  The Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills have worked together to provide a range of services and supports for people who were diagnosed with narcolepsy after receiving the pandemic vaccine on an <i>ex gratia <\/i>basis.  These services and supports, which are co-ordinated by the HSE national advocacy unit, are intended to provide tailored assistance to address their individual requirements.  The HSE regional co-ordinators for narcolepsy liaise with primary care services and hospitals to help narcolepsy patients access the health services they require.  Where services are not available in the community, the regional co-ordinators assist narcolepsy patients and their families to identify private service providers.  They also liaise with schools and the special education section in the Department of Education and Skills regarding educational assessments and supports.<\/p><p>I understand that the HSE continues to meet with SOUND and recently updated it on the development of a centre of excellence at St. James's Hospital.  The centre will include a nurse specialist and dietary service and will facilitate the transition from child to adult services.  Legal action has been initiated by 26 families alleging personal injury in which they are claiming the development of narcolepsy resulted from the administration of the Pandemrix vaccine.  I am sure Senator Whelan understands that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the cases.  I wish to again acknowledge the impact on the lives of these people and families affected by narcolepsy and reiterate the Minister for Health's commitment to the ongoing provision of appropriate services and supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#E00200","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I accept that the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, is here on behalf of the Minister for Health, whom I also believe to be a sound and fair man.

He should do so and his intervention could be very fruitful for the parents and children, their siblings and extended family but also for the State as it could save it the shame and humiliation that would surely be visited upon it for dragging those families through the courts.  I read into what was outlined that the HSE is going to earth on the basis that cases have been filed but there is still an opportunity to stop the cases going to court.  They do not need to go to court.  The 26 cases are only the tip of the iceberg.  There will be more.  There is no need for the matter to proceed to court if common sense and fairness prevail.  What is going on should be stopped now.

It was in this Chamber that the first legislation was tabled to deal with the issue.  The Seanad has done a great deal of work in that regard and it would be useful to engage in a review.  The Minister of State probably has responsibility for this issue.  I would, therefore, welcome a debate to look at the progress of the scheme and how we might be able to improve it.  The previous Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, had committed to doing this, but, obviously, he has now left for bigger and better things.  However, I do not want us to lose focus as the issue is still affecting thousands of homeowners, mainly in Dublin but also along the east coast and the west coast.  We must keep our eyes on the ball.<\/p> <p>I had the pleasure today to launch a public order Bill for Dublin with my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, to initiate a specific public order unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that would focus on the city centre.  While I welcome the additional garda&iacute; who will come through the college in Templemore, we must look at how current resources are being used.  Large swathes of the capital city are fast becoming no-go areas both for citizens and visitors.  I hope, therefore, that the Government will see fit to support the legislation published today by my colleague which would put an onus on the Garda Commissioner to establish a specific unit to be charged with dealing with public order offences, including drug-taking, alcohol misuse and anti-social behaviour, in Dublin city centre.  Such legislation is badly needed, as I am sure colleagues across the House or anyone who has used the Luas to travel to Heuston Station at any time during the day or the DART will be aware.  We have had debates on policing, but I would like the Government to look at the Bill for what it is, namely, an attempt to provide a partial solution to the problem.  There were 700 offences in the capital city against tourists last year.  There are, therefore, 700 individuals who will have a very bad impression of it.

The Labour Court heard matters to do with Dunnes Stores last October, but the company refused to participate.  I urge both sides to the dispute to avail of the services of the State to resolve it.  It can only be resolved through dialogue between both sides.  The Government is preparing new legislation to provide for an enforceable remedy where employers refuse to negotiate as part of the collective bargaining system.  The commitment to this legislation was reflected by both the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach in a statement in July.

The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has officially announced a posthumous presidential pardon which will be signed by the President in the coming days.

It is 75 years since Tipperary man Harry Gleeson was executed for a crime he had not committed.  His life was extinguished in the most questionable of circumstances and it was definitely a gross miscarriage of justice.  Mr. Sean McBride who had defended him always saw it as such, as did the ordinary people who were familiar with the case.  On each occasion when I raised it in the House I always harboured the hope official Ireland, when contemplating the base of justice, would take the opportunity to declare the innocence of Harry Gleeson, for which many had campaigned, including Marcus de B&uacute;rca who produced a book on the case.  The documentary produced by TG4 also played a role in this regard.  I commend the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, for the interest he took in the case and progressing it.  The President of Ireland is also familiar with the case and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has recommended to him that he exercise his power to grant a pardon.  Given its nature and that it is the first time in the State that there has been a posthumous pardon, it would be good if there was a certain formality and solemnity when it was being granted.  I hope the President will consider bringing together in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in the people who took an interest in the case.  Its exceptional nature requires solemnity.

She has since passed on to her eternal reward.  How did I become associated with her?  At the time I was presenting a radio programme on RTE and she was a big fan of country music, particularly Brendan Shine.  My production assistant, Ms Maggie Stapleton, and I used to visit her regularly.  She was bedridden and never talked about the night of the murder.  She had confided in a nurse who used to tend to her regularly but very little specific information emanated from these conversations.  During the time I was visiting her I was not aware of her background, even though we had talked to her about her family and her background in County Tipperary.  We received no information specific to the murder.  As she was in the house on the night her mother was murdered, she knew what had happened, even though she was only a young child.  Marcus de B&uacute;rca made contact with me at the time when he was writing his book in the early 1990s and I remember interviewing him a couple of times on radio.  I am particularly pleased, therefore, that Harry Gleeson has been exonerated.  Once I became aware of the story and its detail, it was perfectly obvious that there were other forces at work.

Virgin Atlantic is one of the stakeholders involved in considering the impact a takeover would have on the business, but of more concern is the fact that there is an interline agreement between Aer Lingus and Virgin Atlantic.  Aer Lingus is the main feeder airline of the significant numbers of Irish consumers who are accessing transatlantic and long haul flights out of three UK airports - Manchester, Gatwick and Heathrow.  More importantly, they promote packages which involve travel to Ireland with Virgin Atlantic, which is boosting the economy.  Irrespective of what happens, if the outcome of the discussions is a takeover of Aer Lingus by IAG, it is certain that the interline agreement will disappear, which would have detrimental effects for the tourism industry.  In that context, Virgin Atlantic is contacting the European Commission.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister that the issue of interline agreements has been raised.  In the ongoing discussions with IAG and Aer Lingus, if the takeover goes ahead, the interline agreement should remain as it is in the interests of the consumer, the economy and the vitally important tourism industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#M00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I support the workers of Dunnes Stores.

It would not be appropriate to be drawn into a debate on whether cash or EFT, electronic funds transfer, payments are better.  That is a matter for customers to decide.  The question for the Department of Social Protection is what works best for welfare clients and how can we deliver, while also serving the taxpayer and the national economy as a whole.<\/p> <p>I will provide the backdrop to the recent trial mailshot.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A few weeks ago a small number of recipients of State contributory and non-contributory pensions received letters from the Department.  They had been selected at random from our database and consisted of men and women who were single and married, living in rural and urban areas and were older and younger pensioners across the country.  It was a very small trial which was aimed at determining the best means of communicating with people about payment options.  These customers were asked to consider whether they would like to receive their payment directly into an account.  The account could be in a bank, a building society, a certain credit union account or An Post savings account.  It was entirely up to the customer to switch if it suited him or her.  Customer engagement was entirely voluntary.  There would be no negative consequences for customers who chose not to respond or engage.  Customers could ignore the letter and continue to be paid in the current manner if they so wished.  However, if they decided to take up this option, the Department would facilitate their request.<br\/><br\/>Let me put the matter in context: the majority of clients who are claiming State pension for the first time choose to be paid directly into an account.  The majority of existing pensioners are already receiving their welfare payment by direct lodgement.  For those who receive the payment in cash, they are free to continue so doing.<br\/><br\/>During the years many welfare clients have been receiving their payments in cash as a habit, despite the fact that they already have accounts in financial institutions through which they could receive other electronic lodgements or transact their financial business.  These customers may now want to consider direct lodgement as an option for the benefits - there are benefits - it can offer.  It might be useful to remind ourselves of them.  Direct lodgement can provide 24 hour access to online and telephone banking, access to point of sale in a multiplicity of retail outlets in rural and urban areas, for the option of cash-back as part of a purchase and the capacity to draw cash through a network of more than 3,000 ATM machines throughout the country. <br\/><br\/>Cash payments limit the options for our clients to make onward transactions.  That is the reality.  When one has cash, one can only make payments in cash.  If one has an account, one can avail of options in respect of direct debits, standing orders, purchasing online, drawing cash from an ATM and getting cash back at a point of sale.  Not having an account limits the scope for welfare clients to avail of cheaper prices online and limits their financial inclusion.  Moreover, electronic payments can mean cheaper utility bills for our clients, including their routine gas and electricity bills.  This point was most recently displayed in a survey undertaken and published in the<i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  Not holding cash can also provide improved personal security by not holding large amounts of cash on their person or in their house.  Notwithstanding these benefits, our clients are free to continue to avail of their existing payment arrangements such that it suits their personal circumstances and needs.  In this context, we must ensure we continually provide a high quality service for our clients and inform them of the various payment options available to them.<br\/><br\/>I am not here as an advocate for the banks, credit unions or any financial body, including An Post.  My focus is primarily on serving our customers.  We need to be aware that 60% of payments to clients in receipt of the State pension are currently paid directly into an account in a financial institution.  Every year we have clients contacting us to revise their payments arrangements.  The aim of the current intervention is to tap into these potential changes among our clients to ask them to consider whether they want to be paid electronically.<br\/><br\/>I turn to the very important role of the post office in our society and around the country.  We all know about its importance, not only in respect of social welfare payments but also in the extent to which it is now a one stop shop where people can pay bills, use the passport application facility, pay local property tax or Garda fines and carry out a range of banking and other financial services.  Successive Governments - this one most notably - have consistently stated their commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in their programmes for Government.  It is important to remember that not only do financial transactions take place but there is also social interaction and social awareness in providing the service.  It is a wide ranging service that is not always connected with a financial transaction but of the postmaster knowing whether Mary or John has been in to collect his or her money.  There is a large social element.<br\/><br\/>It is Government policy that An Post remain a strong and viable company which will be in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focused network of post offices in the community.  An Post has the largest unified retail presence in the country and Ireland has one of the most extensive post office networks per head of population in the EU 27.  The latest figures show that there are 1,139 active company and contractor-operated post offices and a further 131 postal agents.  The commitment of the Government to the post office network becomes very apparent when we look at the trends in post office closures.  In the past four years only 24 An Post operated and contractor operated post offices closed.  By comparison, in the previous four years the figure was 198.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the post office network is manifestly obvious.<br\/><br\/>The Department&rsquo;s support for An Post is equally apparent.  It is the only Department with a contract for services with a total value of over &euro;62 million this year between the contract for welfare payments and costs for postage services.  More than &euro;50 million of this figure relates to the contract for cash payment services for welfare customers this year.  In this regard, the strong working relationship between An Post and the Department is undeniable. <br\/><br\/>For all of this, we each have respective business agendas to follow.  In issuing some 83 million payments annually the Department of Social Protection is a key player in the payment services sector in Ireland.  The manner in which payments are made to customers impacts on the State, taxpayers and customers.  As with all of its activities, the Department is compelled to look at any scope for efficiencies in how it delivers its services to customers.  This includes examining the costs associated with delivering payments to customers to ensure the service reflects customer needs and wants and provides value for all of its stakeholders, as well as for the economy at large.<br\/><br\/>Last year more than &euro;8.5 billion was paid out in cash to welfare clients at post offices.  This accounted for 40.5 million transactions and cost the Department just under &euro;62 million, including internal processing costs.  I need to make the comparison with direct lodgements.  Some 38 million payments were issued directly into accounts in financial institutions by electronic funds transfer, EFT, at a fraction of the cost.  These 38 million EFT payments cost the Department just under &euro;10 million.  In short, cash payments are an inherently more expensive means of paying clients.  It costs approximately six times more to issue a payment in cash than it does to lodge it directly into a customer account.<br\/><br\/>Regardless of the level of support from the Government to An Post, the trend towards electronic payments in society is undeniable.  It creates a challenge for the current business model of An Post.  The economic downturn of recent years provided some buoyancy for post offices, with high levels of unemployed customers receiving weekly welfare payments at their local post office.  When we came into government, the unemployment level was 15.1%, whereas yesterday it was 10%.  Naturally, this has an impact on the level of business at An Post as people collect their entitlements at a local post office.  However, the reduction in unemployment has created challenges.<br\/><br\/>I understand the network is also well positioned to become a front office provider of choice for the Government and the financial services sector.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These services will involve electronic transactions in addition to more traditional over-the-counter transactions.  In this context, I am pleased that An Post is planning for the future and has tendered for the provision of a new transaction account for customers.  This will be significant, not only for An Post but also very much for the customer base.  The account will allow our customers to gain access to much cheaper utility services.  The new service will afford alternative banking opportunities to Departments, customers and many others.<\/p><p>I understand Ulster Bank announced a new partnership with An Post.  This will allow personal and business customers to carry out certain transactions through An Post's network.  Members may be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, formally launched the post office network business development group in February under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Bobby Kerr, to whom I have spoken only recently.  I anxiously await the group's report which could be very significant.  I understand the group will engage with a variety of stakeholders, including those in the public sector, commercial bodies, post office customers and other interested parties.  The group's work will be of strategic importance to the future of the post office network and I look forward to seeing the report which I am informed will be available later this year.<\/p><p>To allay the concerns of Senators, the Department has no plans to issue further letters at this stage.  However, it is not proposed to limit the freedom of the clients concerned to amend their payment arrangements if they so wish, be it on foot of the trial letters issued or in other circumstances.  The Department will continue to offer its clients in receipt of State pensions the choice of receiving their payments at the post office or directly into their accounts.  I am happy to reassure Members that assisted payment options will continue to remain in place in order to reflect the different circumstances and needs of our clients, as has always been the case, and in the interests of serving our customers in the best way.<\/p><p>I very much look forward to listening to the contributions of Senators.  An Post certainly is facing a very challenging period.  We all need to co-operate and work together to try to ensure post offices will continue to operate around the country.  I refer not only to the commercial element of the business, as conducted by postmasters, but also to the social element.  The post office has a very important social function, not only in urban areas.  <\/p><p>I thank Senators for their attention.  I look forward to the debate and the opportunity to respond later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#R00200","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I again welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys.  It is always a pleasure to have him in the House.  Before he made his presentation, I was going to frame my response with a simple one line question: \"Why was the letter sent in the first place, creating all sorts of concern?\"  I am sure the Minister of State will remember that when rumours started to circulate some time ago suggesting free travel would be affected, it caused enormous hassle across the country.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State has explained, on the face of it, the letter seems to be innocuous enough, yet it is rather interesting that the Irish Postmasters Union issued a statement indicating postmasters slammed the Department's letter encouraging the payment of welfare payments through bank accounts.  It refers to the cost being pushed on to the consumer and the electronic payment of welfare payments.  It is obvious that the Department's letter did not state it at all but offered options.  I wonder what the point of it was.  From what I can remember, the form for most social benefits highlights the option of receiving payments by direct mandate.  It does not give equal prominence to the option of receiving payments through one's post office.  That might be partly responsible for what is happening and the Minister of State may correct me if I am wrong.<\/p> <p>There is a trend towards electronic transfers.  The Minister of State is absolutely correct about this, as I know from having had exchanges on this issue with the boss of his Department, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, on a number of occasions.  Interestingly, AIB has an arrangement with the An Post network and now Ulster Bank is entering into an arrangement with it.  That leaves only one other major pillar bank, Bank of Ireland, apart from permanent tsb.  In my home town, for example, there is only one bank branch, that of Bank of Ireland.  There used to be an AIB sub-branch, but there was no Ulster Bank branch.  It is obvious that AIB customers have probably transferred to the post office network and are probably receiving their payments therefrom.  It seems that is the way to go, but it still leaves the reality that post offices are relying to a large extent on the Government contract.<\/p> <p>The post offices have a figure of &euro;57 million for last year.  The Minister of State also has a figure.  Postmasters were paid approximately &euro;25 million of this sum in transaction fees, which represents approximately one third of their income.  One can understand, therefore, the rationale for their concerns about any erosion of their business.  The other aspect, about which I did not know, is that An Post returned &euro;65 million in uncollected benefits to the Department of Social Protection in 2013.  Some of these moneys may have been paid subsequently.  However, there is no return of uncollected payments via electronic funds transfer, leaving the Department potentially exposed.  It has a figure of up to &euro;65 million, but I am sure it is putting a spin on it.  It is a point of note that &euro;65 million has been returned, but I do not know why.  Is it in unpaid benefits?  Why is it not the position in the case of the banks?  Payment through the An Post network deters fraud, which is acknowledged by the Department.<\/p> <p>The postal network comprises a major industry.  There are 3,700 people employed, while &euro;2.1 million is paid in rates to local authorities.  Wages exceed &euro;64 million which is spent in local economies and the national economy, with a total contribution in PRSI payments in excess of &euro;10 million.<\/p> <p>It is interesting that the Irish Postmasters Union states in its submission that it fully appreciates that some people may find it more convenient to receive their welfare payments by electronic transfer but that there is the opportunity to develop an electronic system through the post office network to accommodate this.  It states no further transfer of post office transactions to the commercial banks should be pursued until a long-term solution which includes using the post office is found.  The inference throughout is that the Department's letter is forcing people to make a choice.  The Minister of State has clarified that matter.  I am curious to know why the Department bothered sending the letters in the first place as the Minister of State has made it quite clear that people have a choice.  One can understand the concerns of the post office network that when a letter is sent, there is a covert conspiracy theory behind it.  Perhaps those concerned do not trust the Department, perhaps because they are blaming it for what effectively is the phenomenon of people voting with their feet.  They are increasingly opting for EFT, but, at the same time, there is a need to develop some system that could mirror the EFT system through the pillar banks.  I am not sure how it would work in practice.<\/p> <p>If I had a bank account and wanted to opt for payment through the post office network, how would I do it in a cashless context?  Would there be a facility that would allow for the transfer of the money from the Department to my account in the post office which, in turn, would transfer the money to my account in the bank?  There is a very real challenge for the post office network.  I do not want in any way to rain on its parade, but it is increasingly obvious that we are moving towards a cashless society.  Ireland is unique in Europe in that its citizens use the largest number of cheques.  Ireland has the lowest number of cashless transactions relative to other European countries and we are now playing catch-up.  Owing to the closure of various bank branches, I am sure the Minister of State will agree that there is now a continuing opportunity for, apart from a challenge facing, the post office network.  It has AIB on board and it is now getting Ulster Bank to do so.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paschal Mooney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I hope that perhaps other services provided by Government would be channelled through the post office network.

As the Minister has outlined, post offices are the largest retail network in the country with 1,150 post offices employing 3,700 people, 1,100 of which offices are operated by postmasters who are locally based SMEs providing employment, facilitating economic activity and community engagement.  It is vital now more than ever that the post office network is supported.  A total of 30% of all post office business is derived from delivering social welfare cash payments, but the State is moving towards electronic payment, and utilities are moving towards electronic billing and payments.  Stamp sales are falling as more communication is done electronically and the network is under considerable pressure.  In that light, the appointment of a review group led by Mr. Bobby Kerr is most welcome.  It will report shortly to the Government on what services could be offered through the post office network.  I hope suggestions emanating from the group will be received quickly, examined thoroughly and implemented quickly.<\/p> <p>In addition, the Department of Social Protection will pay more than &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers this year.  Approximately half of all welfare payments, amounting to more than &euro;8.5 billion a year, go through the post office network, benefiting more than 800,000 customers.  This money represents almost 20% of Government day-to-day spending, showing the significance to An Post of this very important contract and the importance of the network to the State.  The contract will support jobs and communities throughout the country.<\/p> <p>It must be repeated time and again that a rural post office is not just a commercial office.  It is something of a social service.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, acknowledged that today.  People meet and greet in post offices which offer a service to communities and which might be the only bricks and mortar service for miles around.  We have seen recently the closure of the only bank in a midlands town.  The banks are retrenching in terms of their branch network and An Post is considering the alternatives.  Rather than put all its eggs in the one basket, An Post should actively and aggressively try to grow its business.  In this context I am pleased to note that some effort has been taken to do just that.  An Post has tendered for the provision of what will be akin to a banking current account.  That is something that should have been done long ago.  It will be another very useful service it can offer.  In addition, Ulster Bank will shortly commence offering services throughout the post office network.  Ulster Bank&rsquo;s customers will be able to make cash deposits, have cheques accepted and pay bills.  Other services could include motor tax, driver licence renewals, and the payment of rates, rents and other local authority charges.  Lodgement and withdrawal services for credit unions should also be considered.  In addition, other options to consider relate to hospital charges, electronic form generation, insurance quotations and pension savings.  An Post already offers some very good services that are not well publicised.  More could be done to advertise its services.  It has for instance a household budget scheme whereby recipients of a wide range of State payments can arrange to have their usual household bills paid by regular deduction.  That is a very convenient way to manage a household.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State adverted to the recent issuance of letters to randomly selected recipients of State pensions as a trial.  It was done to determine the best means of communicating with people about payment options.  It was a limited trial in that letters were sent to just under 1% of customers.  Customer engagement with the trial was entirely voluntary, as the Minister for Social Protection has promised the Department has not introduced changes nor does it intend to do so.  While the State will do all it can to help support the post office network, in particular in rural areas, there must be local support.  It is very noticeable that a majority of social welfare recipients choose to have their payment made through electronic transfer.  This is obviously done for a variety of reasons, including privacy, which is understandable.  The Government cannot force people to have their payments made through the post office network.  The very straightforward situation is that if local communities do not choose to use post offices and if An Post does not provide the services that are needed and advertise them properly, the network is at risk.  The Government can only do so much and it will play its part.  There have been very few post office closures in recent years.  The Minister of State stated that compared with when Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats were in office, the Government is fully committed to the post office network.  We have commissioned a review of State services that could be offered through the network.  I hope such services will be offered very soon.  We cannot do it alone, however.  Rather than criticise the Government, which has done more than has ever been done to support the network of post offices, the Opposition should urge communities to take their business to their local post office.  That will go a long way to ensure the survival of the post office network.  Senator Mooney referred to correspondence from the Irish Postmasters Union.  I would welcome the comments of the Minister of State on its correspondence with the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#U00200","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Reilly for allowing me to contribute at this point.  I also thank the Leader who was very quickly on the case when I raised this issue last week.  Concern about the post office network and the threat to its long-term viability is one of the issues that is supported by Members from all parties and none.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, is aware of the value of the service and social aspect from an inner city perspective.  I am from a rural town.  The post office network is one of the remaining services in rural towns, especially smaller rural towns.  I come from a rural post office in Kilfinane, County Limerick.  The bank used to be across the road but it has closed and the nearest bank is a number of miles away.  When the bank went, a number of businesses followed because they took their business elsewhere.  In many towns in rural areas one is left with very little more than a shell.  Anyone who is from outside the main Dublin commuter belt is aware of that.  Little goes on in such towns and it is difficult to attract anyone to them.  In my area we are trying to fight back.  We are trying to develop a tourism product to attract people.  We need services such as post offices.  We have lost banks, Garda stations, creameries and other businesses that have gone to larger towns.  It is difficult in those circumstances to provide any form of employment.  The recent issuance of letters undermined the post office network.  The closure of post offices would be regrettable due to the effect on rural society in smaller towns and villages.<\/p> <p>Reference was made to the social service aspect of post offices.  Rural isolation is a major issue.  I accept that many recipients of social welfare payments, including old age pensioners, will opt to have their money paid into a bank account.  I do not think the Irish Postmasters Union argues against that, as it is the way things are going, but the post office should be able to provide an electronic funds transfer facility.  At the moment that service is not provided by the post office network.  When older people who come from a town&rsquo;s hinterland meet on one day of the week, namely, pension day, they generate a buzz in an area.  The post office is a great place to meet people, catch up on what is going on, feel part of one's local community and meet people one would not otherwise meet.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Heffernan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2362\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2362&amp;amp;pid=JamesHeffernan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Some of the letters sent out were a bit over the top.  They stated if a person was away on holidays or was unwell, they did not need to worry because their pension would be lodged into their account.  This is telling people not to worry, the Department is here to look after them, they can stay inside and watch television but they will not have any human contact.  The letter also informed people that the majority of the Department&rsquo;s customers get their contributory State pension paid directly into their bank accounts.<\/p><p>I concur with Senator Mooney on the &euro;65 million in uncollected payments, such as where a pension recipient passes on, that are returned to the Department.

Several Senators requested a debate on this matter only last week.  It is good for Members to outline their views and air their concerns, as well as providing reliable and accurate information on this issue.  There is no evidence to suggest the Department of Social Protection, much less the Government, is attempting to undermine the post office network.  On the contrary, it could be argued it is shoring it up.  I agree with Senators Heffernan, Mooney and Naughton that one cannot exaggerate the vital and strategic importance of the post office to its community.  It is a hub of social and economic activity, as well as being vital to the sustainability of rural communities and smaller towns.<\/p> <p>By the same token, however, there have been many misconceptions and misrepresentations as well as much mischief around this debate.  No one values the importance of the post office network on the ground as much as I do.  My local post office in Timahoe, County Laois, closed two years ago.  County Laois has also lost a post office in Ballacolla.  Of the 24 post offices closed during the lifetime of this Government, two have been in County Laois.  Putting it in context, however, almost 200 post offices were closed during the lifetime of the previous Government.<\/p> <p>This should not be a question of keeping score, however.  I got involved in trying to keep these post offices open.  I used to sign on for my social protection payments at my local post office.  As it was so close, I could cycle down to it and enjoyed having a chat with the postmaster, Mr. Arthur Kerr.  His family gave a dedicated service, six days a weeks over the years, an extraordinary commitment.  The reason the post office closed was because he was retiring.  After giving ample notice, however, no one else in the entire area was willing to take up the function of postmaster and run the post office because it is an arduous commitment, particularly with modern lifestyles, family commitments and changes in career attitudes.  While everyone was clamouring to keep it open, there was not the sufficient number of people using the service or people willing to operate it.  This is part of the challenge in keeping a post office network running.<\/p> <p>Attempts to solve the problem have been flawed.  There has been an overreaction to the mailshot from the Department with some mischief around it.  It caused concern because it affected pensions.  When elderly people get a letter from the State, alarm bells tend to ring.  The letter was well-intended, not an attempt to undermine the post office service.  However, one can see how it could have caused unnecessary alarm.<\/p> <p>The difficulties for post offices cannot be solved in isolation.  I welcome the involvement of the Bobby Kerr review group.  There is no better man to come up with suggestions to make the post office network more attractive, feasible and sustainable.  Senator Naughton hit the nail on the head when she spoke about making the post office more vital, relevant and potent as a service provider.  We need the co-operation and the involvement of the Department of Finance to expedite the proposal to scale up the banking capacity and financial services rendered by the post office network.  We cannot continue to rely on social protection payments to sustain the post office network.  The Minister of State mentioned this himself.  The advantage and benefits of the economic recovery are not necessarily good news for one aspect of the post office's services.  The fewer people who will require social welfare payments, the less turnover for the post office network.  While I wish this will continue for a long time, it means less business for the network.<\/p> <p>The Department of Finance must become involved with the Departments of Social Protection and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to come forward with a coherent collective response.  One cannot strip out the post office issue without taking account of rural schools, transport and bus connectivity, GP services and rural broadband.  All these services make it possible to ensure rural services and facilities are attractive and can compete on a level that will retain people in the community and maintain a critical mass of population in rural areas.  This in turn will allow the post office to have a vibrant, vigorous and prosperous future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#V00500","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I will keep my contribution brief as much of what I was going to say has been articulated by previous speakers.  The core of the discussion relates to the fact that the Department wrote to a number of social welfare recipients encouraging them to have their payments made directly to their bank accounts and making them aware of the option of that facility.  Only yesterday, a Minister of State said the Government is undermining its own plan to save post offices, which is concerning.  A Grant Thornton report last year highlighted how up to 557 out of 1,550 post offices would close if the social welfare contract was removed from An Post.  The letters that were sent, therefore, were concerning for the postmasters, given they are struggling to survive in a difficult environment.  The letters caused a great deal of distress for them.  If people felt they were being actively encouraged to have payments made to their bank accounts, it would have a negative psychological impact on the postmasters.<\/p> <p>Post offices cannot be discussed in isolation without considering other rural services that have suffered over recent years, whether that is Garda stations or small rural schools.  Rural post offices are coming under a great deal of pressure and they have been threatened with closure over recent years.  Post offices are central to local communities and it is important to ensure the services they provide are protected, given they are a focal point for social interaction.  Closures are regarded as increasing the level of isolation and loneliness experienced by people.  If that one activity of going to collect a payment is removed, people might find they do not have day-to-day interaction with anyone from end of the week to the other.<\/p> <p>We support the retention of local postal services throughout the State and the retention of social welfare payments through them.  That is important as part of a wider range of financial services to help ensure their viability.  As many Members mentioned, there is a great deal of potential for post offices to provide a range of services to communities and we should not undermine them.  It is regrettable that the letters to which I referred issued in the first instance.  We should move to give post offices a greater arsenal of functions to serve rural communities.  If we do that, it will help their viability and enhance the social fabric of communities not just in rural Ireland but in urban neighbourhoods throughout the State, which also depend on postal services.  I thank the Minister of State for attending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#W00100","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>A total of 60% of payments to social welfare clients are made through direct payment.  When innovative technologies are used or promoted by the Department, it should be highlighted at the bottom of all correspondence with clients in a note stating \"Please note that this new facility is available if you would like to avail of it\".  It is an optional extra and it would be good advertising by the Department.  Notices are regularly sent by Departments and it would be a good way to circulate this information rather than sending a letter to a few clients.  If people get a letter and their neighbours do not, that will scare them.  They will wonder why they were singled out and that is enough to scare people.  However, the letter at the centre of this debate should not have scared people and there were unintended consequences.

Ireland has suffered from bad planning for a long time.  The death of rural towns is a serious problem.  I have travelled the country for the past six months engaging with people and I have seen the empty shop units in small rural villages.  I am proud that the Government has taken this issue seriously and that is why a Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, has been appointed with responsibilities in this regard ranging across Departments to ensure joined-up thinking to tackle this serious problem.  It is such a serious problem because of lack of proper spatial planning or appropriate planning and, in some cases, because of corrupt planning which has crucified the country.  There has been poor planning in this country for decades.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Mooney for his contribution.  He raised the issue of the social welfare payments returned by the post offices to the Department.  I am sure, like me, he has dealt with many queries in his clinic from people who spent the previous two months in hospital and did not receive their payment.  The money was returned to the Department and they want to know how they can get their payments.  If the money had been paid directly into their bank account, it would not have been returned to the Department.  I do not say this is the reason in every case of returned money but it is an example of how money is returned.  The payments are time limited and, therefore, if the money is not collected in the post office, the money is automatically returned to the Department.  Every Member has probably has dealt with this issue where a person fell ill or was delayed returning from a holiday and their money was returned to the Department.<\/p> <p>I have read the letter at the centre of the debate a number of times and, unless I am missing something, I do not see any threat in it.  However, the Department must learn how to communicate well with its customers and this was an effort to do that.  A small sample size was used.  I like to think of myself as an open and accessible Minister of State.  I try to respond immediately to everyone who contacts me, whether they are a councillor, Senator or Deputy.<\/p> <p>With regard to Senator Heffernan's comments, this was an opportunity or a trial to communicate with our customers.  He touched on the very reason we need to learn how to do that well, which is to put systems in place for future changes.  As he said, one of the future changes could be the transaction account for customers.  If that is introduced, we need to know the best way to communicate that to customers such as whether we need to write to everyone or set up call centres.  The best way to do that is to take a small sample size of customers, communicate with them and monitor the reaction.  The transaction account would be a positive development if it were introduced because it would help the customer base in many ways that Members have probably not even thought of.  If it is introduced, how will we notify our customers?  How many calls will that generate?  We wrote to 0.3% of customers in this case and we can scale up based on the interaction generated.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is annoying that, for their own reasons, people have reacted in a certain way.

There was nothing frightening in the letter sent, but there has been a great deal of scaremongering in press releases, as well as in the letters and e-mails I have received.  I find it funny - actually, it is not funny since it is serious in many ways - that the people who were upset and antagonised sent their complaints by e-mail.  They want to maintain An Post's services, but they used e-mails instead of going to their post offices and buying stamps.  A number were post office employees.

It involves radical, comprehensive and sweeping reform of the freedom of information provisions.  In particular, the creation of the reverse presumption was hugely welcome.  The presumption that had applied under the 1997 Act was that a public body had to be specifically included in the FOI regime, whereas in the new regime the Minister introduced under the 2014 Act it was stated a public body so defined would automatically be subject to FOI legislation unless specifically exempted.  That is a hugely welcome and progressive change in favour of transparency and it is in that context that we are ooking at these orders.

I will be brief.<\/p> <p>At a time when there is a need for greater transparency in public bodies, some have found it perplexing that for bodies such as the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal there will be an effective date for freedom of information requests, as mentioned, of 14 October 2014.  The issues that it is claimed are driving this change are, first, the protection of sensitive personal information against third parties and, second, that if the records remain subject to release under FOI legislation, each record will be subject to review, giving rise to a substantial administrative burden.  However, the substantial administrative burden referred to in favour of the passing of the motion might perhaps become obsolete, given that a cost will still be incurred, albeit from a later date.  I do not believe the conepts of transparency and fairness should be punished because of a fear of incurring administrative costs.  I know that ensuring accountability, transparency and adhering to human rights has a cost, but we should be willing to meet it.<\/p> <p>Concerns have been raised that this could be seen as the latest move in a trend that has been developing.  For example, prior to this, the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner was not allowed oversight of direct provision centres in spite of the all-party Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight endorsing the request.<\/p> <p>Senator Ivana Bacik has mentioned an e-mail we all received this morning from the Irish Refugee Council urging us to oppose the motion on the grounds that no reasons had been given for proposing the date of 14 October 2014.

There was an freedom of information request yesterday that concerned my secretary's name.  My secretary is a lady who came to me after I was elected, looked for a job, went through a formal interview process and got that job.  Her employment with me is private to her.  If she chooses to make her name known, I welcome her doing so but it is outrageous that any journalist anywhere in the country would start making freedom of information requests for the names of people who work in my office.  If they want to know whether I hired my wife, daughter, son, granny or anyone else, they can just ask me.  They can pick up the phone and ask me.  Some clown sought information about my salary under freedom of information.  I am sorry if I have referred to them as a clown but my salary is on the web.  If they want to see what I earn, they should look on the web.  If they want to see what my expenses are, they should look on the web.  Let us stop wasting the time of public servants answering what I regard as vexatious freedom of information requests.<\/p><p>When the freedom of information tool was introduced, it was commendable.  It opened up Government and made it available to the people.  Departments and decisions made by Ministers have been made available to the people.  Is it important to know whether I hired Mary Murphy, Julia Maguire or John O'Dwyer?  Does it really matter?  If I took a flight to Brussels on behalf of the State or for some work associated with it, is it really that important?  People can make those types of requests under freedom of information if they wish.  Where we are talking about individuals employed in this House who are not public representatives and have not put themselves before the public, there is an onus on the Data Protection Commissioner to protect their identities if they want to do that.  If someone wants to know whether I have employed relations, they should ask me straight out.  I will be writing to the Data Protection Commissioner about this issue.  I regard it as a gross intrusion into my secretary's life.  If I was to write to Bank of Ireland, IBM or Microsoft and ask for a list of the secretaries there and the managers who employed them, would I get that information?  Would I have any reason to get that information?  Is it any of my business?<\/p><p>Will the Minister, as the Minister with responsibility for this, support me on this issue?  If someone wants to know about relatives working for Members of the Oireachtas, they should ask straight out.  Incidentally, I am not condemning that either.  I am not saying it is wrong where a Member of the Oireachtas may have an unemployed son or daughter who would be capable of taking on the work.

I was looking at the regulation of lobbying website that will be piloted in the next few months and that will become live on 1 September 2015.  It will change the way all of us are lobbied.  I do not think people are quite prepared for the changes that will come in.  That is part of the new regime that it is right for us to bed down.<\/p><p>The most important part of the process we are undergoing here is that an intrinsic part of the new freedom of information regime is that everyone is in unless both Houses put them out.  This is why I must explain if there are any exclusions from any public body.  It is a great help to me to resist calls from so many bodies which would like to be excluded either whole or in part.

We said that ten years on from that is the effective date.  This will apply to the 500 or more bodies that will now be encompassed by freedom of information.  A number of bodies made submissions to me about practical issues relating to that level of backdating.  The only ones that could convince me beyond doubt are before the House today.<\/p><p>The Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal are coming in for the first time.  The Refugee Applications Commissioner has four million paper files so one can imagine the administrative burden if all those had to be open to third party freedom of information requests.  My fear was that we would delay the processing of genuine applications and, for that reason, I decided that we would commence it from a date that is practical.  As Senator Bacik rightly said, there is no limit regarding applications from refugees who wish to access their own files.<\/p><p>The other date change concerns the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  Why did I pick 2012 as the operable date for that?  It is because 2012 was the year it created electronic files.  Before that, it dealt with paper files and had 1.2 million files per year, so that would grind to a halt if we did not make a practical decision relating to that.  Therefore, the date of the creation of electronic files in 2012 is the operational date.<\/p><p>I hope that explains the situation to the House.  I should mention the <i>cri du coeur<\/i>from Senator Craughwell.  If I go to important meetings with a member of the European Commission or the Council of Ministers, I often hope I might get a freedom of information request about the contents of the discussion.  I never do but I will get a freedom of information request about the cost of the flight and where I stayed.  Perhaps that is the nature of things and perhaps we will mature beyond that some day.  Apparently, there are one or two people who do nothing else but make freedom of information requests about expenses, and I think we will see their names cropping up with the freedom of information requests that are coming in.  From my perspective, most Departments are putting everything on the web so people can simply look at the web.<\/p><p>Open and transparent administration is a requirement of regaining the trust of the people.  We will mature in the way we deal with freedom of information requests.  In parallel, we will look at the open Government partnership arrangements where we will have open data in order that an increasing number of data sets will be available as a default mechanism so there will be no need to ask specifically for them because they will be available for public scrutiny.  I said that the retrospective date for all of the 500 or more bodies would be April 2008.  This applies to new bodies.  The effective date for all existing bodies goes back to 1998, which was the date of operation of the original Act.  I thank Senators for their support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#AA00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427967000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Act 2014 (Exempted Public Bodies) Order 2015: Motion","time":1427967000,"counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#AA00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>That Seanad &Eacute;ireann approves the following Order in draft:Freedom of Information Act 2014 (Exempted Public Bodies) Order 2015,copies of which Order in draft were laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 12th March, 2015.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#AA00500","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427967000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>When it is proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#AA00700","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>It is proposed to sit again at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 15 April 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015040200002#AA00800","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427967000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 2.50 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 15 April 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
