In an interview on RTE recently the new Chief Justice acknowledged a basic problem in the justice system, namely, the cost of engaging in litigation in certain cases was beyond the resources of many.  There is little point in having a good courts system if a great many people find it difficult, if not impossible, to access it.  That is true both for citizens and small businesses.  The 2016 District Court rules which I downloaded yesterday indicate that it costs approximately &euro;3,000 to hire a solicitor specialising in the area of intellectual property, while it costs approximately &euro;1,000 to hire a barrister.  Therefore, it would cost a total of &euro;4,000 to take to court an infringement claim for &euro;1,500.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister of State will note that it involves a disproportionate cost for many small businesses to bring actions under these circumstances.

It is clearly a justice issue and one for the Minister for Justice and Equality.  If we want to be a country that encourages people to be entrepreneurial and to start their own businesses, they must have access to the courts system.<\/p><p>There is an EU ruling on this area.  Ireland is in breach of an EU ruling to allow a small business person to take a claim to our courts and to represent themselves.  Failing our allowing a small business person to represent themselves, we should provide them with free legal aid, but it would be much more cost-effective to allow small business persons to represent themselves in our courts system.  It is within the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality to allow this.  This issue has been dodged for two years.  I am seeking action today rather than platitudes.  Urgent action needs to be taken if we are to encourage the development of an entrepreneurial society.

The Minister appreciates the Senator's interest in this subject and apologises for not being able to be here due to a commitment in Dublin Castle.<\/p><p>First, on behalf of the Minister, it is not accepted that the State is in breach of EU law in regard to the matter the Senator has raised.  Council Directive No. 2004\/48\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights has been transposed into lrish law by the European Communities (Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights) Regulations 2006, Sl 360 of 2006.  Proceedings may be brought in the District Court for damages for breach of copyright where a claim falls within that court's threshold, which is a maximum of &euro;15,000, and legal costs recoverable in the District Court are fixed by a scale in the District Court rules, which measures the costs in proportion to the value of the claim.<\/p><p>By contrast with remedies under EU law such as those falling within the European small claims procedure, the directive on enforcement of intellectual property rights does not mandate that remedies relating to intellectual property claims under the national law of a member state be the subject of a small claims procedure, nor does it mandate that corporations be entitled to represent themselves when bringing an intellectual property claim before the courts.<\/p><p>In so far as self-representation is concerned, this has been the subject of a detailed report in March 2016 of the Company Law Review Group, a statutory advisory expert body that advises the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on the review and development of company law in Ireland.  According to the report, the review group remains to be convinced of the need for a radical overhaul of the law in this area.  Although it remains sympathetic to the plight of the many companies that fell victim to the collapse of the property market and recognises that in the absence of available funding a number of companies have been unable to have their objections to summary judgment heard, the review group recognises that the courts retain the discretion to hear from non-lawyers where justice requires and are best placed to determine whether justice so requires in the case of companies which are party to court proceedings.  In particular, the review group does not recommend that legislation should introduce a blanket permission to companies to be represented by their shareholders, officers or others, or a general entitlement to so act where they are in financial difficulty.<\/p><p>The review group observes that the general rule against <i>pro se <\/i>representation of companies in court is well-established in Ireland and almost universally followed in other jurisdictions.  There is no suggestion that the Irish approach is significantly out of line with the approach in most other jurisdictions.  While the strict application of the rule may on occasion lead to apparent or real hardship, such consequences can be considered the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for the concession of separate legal personality.  As &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh CJ stated in Battle <i>v<\/i>. Irish Art Promotion Centre Ltd. in 1968, the creation of the company is the act of its subscribers.  The subscribers, in discarding their own personae for the persona of the company, doubtless did so for the advantages which incorporation offers to traders.  In seeking incorporation, they thereby lose their legal right of audience which they would have as individuals, but the choice has been their own.<\/p><p>I hope that clarifies the matter for the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#B00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to be brief in his supplementary question.

EU law demands that we must either let companies represent themselves or increase the costs that are recoverable, or give legal aid.  That is quite clear. The Minster spoke about the review.  The Copyright Review Committee put forward sensible proposals in line with our EU partners.  For example, in the Netherlands, companies can bring claims of less than &euro;24,000 without a lawyer, in Germany, they can bring claims of less than &euro;5,000, in England, there is no limit, in Sweden, no lawyer is required, and in Scotland, they are planning to introduce measures with respect to intellectual property, IP, rights through the small claims court, a system on which the Chairman has just commented.<\/p> <p>The response the Minister of State has given is contradictory to the view the Taoiseach gave seven years ago when he raised the same issue regarding enforced representation with the then Minister, Mary Coughlan, and that was questioned with respect to item 213 of 2010.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to ask for the Department to correspond with me in a factual manner.  There are a number of inaccuracies in the reply I was given.  The way the system is operating protects large businesses and gives no support to small businesses, with the effect that the only people making money out of this are solicitors and barristers.  If small business people want to take a claim, they will be at a loss.  Most of the time they cannot afford it, so no claim is taken.  If we want to encourage people to set up small businesses, we must allow them access to the courts and at the very least they should be allowed to represent themselves.  I find such onerous costs of up to &euro;4,000 for a claim of only &euro;1,500 unacceptable.

I first raised this issue with the former Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, in the context of a wider debate on mental health and before she moved on from Department of Health.  I raise it this morning for a more parochial reason, namely, that there is considerable concern in the local area about the future not only of the hospital and the activities within it but the site on which it is located.  The Central Mental Hospital has been located in Dundrum for more than 150 years.  It sits on a 34-acre site with an immediate local population of just over 12,500 people.  I am aware that it is in the ownership of the Office of Public Works.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Neale Richmond:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have a number of questions relating to the future of the hospital and what will happen.  Those questions relate to the timing of the departure.  The hospital and its activities are due to move to St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane in north county Dublin, however, the dates for an expected move have shifted a number of times due to various planning concerns and concerns over construction times, so could the Minister of State elaborate on when the hospital is due to move or give us an earlier estimation if possible?  <\/p><p>When the hospital does move, that leaves this 34-acre site in the middle of a very populous area up for grabs.  The Minister of State is substituting for the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, this morning but I know it is of particular interest to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  What is the future for this large site in the heart of peri-urban and suburban Dublin?  First and foremost, the site, which is covered by my forming stamping ground of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, is zoned for institutional use but there is an allowance for an element of residential use.  There were a number of local protests during the summer from a certain fringe group that wanted the entire site to be converted to social housing - estimated at up to 1,200 units.  I would imagine that this would be quite large and go against the whole idea of balanced housing strategy but I would like to hear the Minister of State's personal insight if that was possible.  <\/p><p>The future of the hospital has been up for grabs.  We heard at one stage that it was a possible site for a foreign country wanting to host its ambassador's residence.  We have heard that it might revert to the Irish Prison Service or stay within the HSE but, ultimately, what is needed with a large site in the middle of a well-populated area is that it opens up to the community.  For over 150 years, it has been closed off to the community.  Very impressive large granite walls are all most people know.  I have contacted the powers that be to request a tour.  It was very common under the Eastern Health Board but it has not been done recently in terms of reaching out to the community.  We know about the patients who are resident in that hospital and we know a lot about the crimes they committed in the past but going forward, this is an opportunity to open it up to the community and develop it as a central part of Dundrum.  A lot of people are looking to re-imagine Dundrum and we want people to know that Dundrum is far more than a shopping centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#B01000","speaker":"1399","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Richmond for raising this issue and apologise for the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, could not be here to take it because, as the Senator knows, he is interested in this following on from the work of the previous Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  The development of all aspects of mental health, including the national forensic mental health service delivered by the Central Mental Hospital, remains a priority for the Government.  Opened in 1850, the Central Mental Hospital was the one of the world's first facilities to balance the needs of a therapeutic care environment in a secure setting.  Although currently in use, it has been obvious for some time that this Victorian building is not suitable for 21st-century mental health care.  Therefore, in accordance with the Government's commitment to implement A Vision for Change, we prioritised this year significant capital funding to provide a modern forensic mental health complex at St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane.  The new facilities recently commenced construction and are due to become operational in 2020.  That is the most up-to-date position.<\/p> <p>The Central Mental Hospital admits patients from both the prison service and mental health approved centres.  In order to meet increasing demands, a unit within the hospital has been refurbished to provide an additional ten beds for those referred primarily under section 21(2) of the Mental Health Act.  The HSE is currently in discussions with nursing unions via the Workplace Relations Commission regarding opening this unit as quickly as possible.  Managing the competing priorities of all those who have been assessed as requiring admission is being done on the basis of assessed clinical need and is monitored on a weekly basis by the Central Mental Hospital.  In addition, the national forensic mental health service provides prison in-reach clinics at Cloverhill, Mountjoy and the D&oacute;chas Centre along with Wheatfield, Midlands, Portlaoise, Castlerea and Arbour Hill prisons.  <\/p> <p>Following the signing of a contract in June 2017, construction of the new 170-bed national forensic mental health complex started at Portrane.  The new national centre will provide psychiatric care in a modern and high-quality facility that rivals the best abroad.  The new 120-bed national forensic mental health hospital at Portrane will replace the existing 93 beds at the Central Mental Hospital and will also provide a new ten-bed forensic unit for children and adolescents and a new ten-bed unit for mental health intellectual disability.  In addition, the new complex will include a new 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit, the first of its kind in the country.  Such a facility has long been called for and will help relieve pressures both on the main forensic hospital and on the prison system by enabling greater diversion of low-level offenders with mental health issues away from the justice system to appropriate mental health care.  In common with the recognised excellence of the Central Mental Hospital, the new complex will augment the concept of recovery in a modern and clinical setting.  <\/p> <p>The disposal or otherwise of the site of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum cannot proceed until such time as the hospital is vacated following the completion of the new national forensic mental health service facilities at Portrane.  However, I think it makes total sense, as Senator Richmond noted, for us to have this discussion and make plans for the future because 2020 is not that far away.  As the Department responsible for planning, that is something on which we would be happy to engage with the Senator, no doubt through his local authority.  We recognise that the Central Mental Hospital is part of the State property portfolio under the Office of Public Works, which is a State Agency of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It would make total sense to look at this site and, as the Senator rightly notes, involve the community in that conversation, including the needs of the Dundrum area and how they can be serviced.  <\/p> <p>Regarding housing, as the Department responsible for housing and planning, we are under a lot of pressure to deliver housing in key areas like Dublin city and the surrounding areas.  We would be interested in looking at that site but delivering a development of 1,200 social housing units anywhere is not in our plans.  We are very clear on this.  While we are trying to tackle the housing crisis and deliver social and private housing, we do not believe the development of large-scale social housing on one site is the way to solve this.  Naturally, in those decisions, one looks at the entire area and sees what the percentages are.  In respect of sites that are State-owned, we are looking at mixed developments and having a mixture of social, affordable and private housing in different percentages and other services.  It strikes me that this is a conversation that must be held locally and the Senator is right to approach it from a community point of view in terms of what is needed in Dundrum.  That might involve some residential development but that decision would generally be up to the local authorities.  In March 2017, we looked at all State-owned sites throughout the country that could be used for land.  I do not think this site was included on that for housing but we have 800 sites throughout the country that we are looking at and we will bring forward plans on those sites that are suitable for housing.  It could be looked at in that context.  The OPW would be the main body that would own the site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#C00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Senator Richmond might revisit the matter in the spring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#C00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and commend him on his work.

The need for solar farms to have planning guidelines is an important issue in so many locations throughout Ireland and it affects most local authorities.  It is becoming very important because we have had 225 planning applications for solar farms throughout Ireland in the past 24 months.  This issue needs to be dealt with and is one of the core issues relating to our renewable energy policy.  We have targets we hope to meet by 2020.  Renewable energy is a very important part if we are to reach those targets and solar farms will play a role in that.  How big the role will be will be determined in many ways by Government policy.  In particular, I note the White Paper on energy that was published a few years' ago.<\/p> <p>We need national Government to move into the frame and put planning guidelines in place so that communities, developers and local authorities have the ability to plan around the national guidelines.  There is frustration among local authorities, developers, communities and even An Bord Plean&aacute;la about the lack of that national framework.  We have seen some decisions that have been made in the past few months.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la famously stated at the start of the year that it was extremely worried about the sudden wave of applications coming forward without national guidelines.  We have seen decisions by local authorities, one only a few weeks ago, where planning permission was refused because of the lack of national guidelines.  Everybody is saying that there is a lack of such guidelines.  Communities, developers and local authorities would welcome them.  It is a very important sector but it needs to be regulated.  In so many ways we are over-regulated but in this area we are looking for a Department to bring forward guidelines.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->To me, they are essential if we are to have proper, sustainable development.  The real guideline is that a developer sees a generation station or substation in a location and knows that it is the location where it would be more financially beneficial for him or her to locate a solar farm.  It has nothing to do with planning guidelines, quality of soil or the level of the land.  These are big issues that we need to consider.  A total of 225 planning applications went through the system without these guidelines and there are more coming.  There is a wave of them coming.  Until there is clarity on tariffs, we will continue to have a wave.  That is an issue the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, needs to clarify at some stage.  <\/p><p>I raised this issue on 15 November and have seen very little progress since.  I raised it with the Minister on 7 December and have seen very little progress since.  I am raising it again now, nearly one year later.  In many ways, this is the time we need planning guidelines to be put in place in order that the local authorities which have to make decisions will have the ability to make fair decisions.  At present, it is a case of one decision at a time.

I am glad that I am here in a different building but in the same office to discuss this issue.<\/p> <p>There are no specific planning guidelines in place for solar farms and, as matters stands, I have no proposal to bring forward such guidelines.  We discussed the issue before and, if need be, I will not hesitate to act in this area.<\/p> <p>Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, each planning authority&rsquo;s development plan is required to set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, among other things, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities and infrastructure.  Many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context, rightly so, and I encourage others to do the same.  Proposals for individual solar farm developments are also subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments.  Planning applications are required to be submitted to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p> <p>In making decisions on planning applications planning authorities and the board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, submissions or observations received and relevant ministerial or Government policies, including relevant guidelines issued by my Department.  Planning authorities must then make their own decision, based on the specific merits, or otherwise, of individual planning applications.  I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments.  I am very clear that the lack of national guidelines is not a reason for refusing a solar farm application.  We can have discussions about other reasons, but the lack of national planning guidelines is not an appropriate reason for refusal.<\/p> <p>The matter will be kept under review  in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and his Department, the lead Department on renewable energy policy, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Energy Policy which was published in December 2015, the development of a renewable electricity policy and development framework, REPDF, and the launching of a new subsidy support scheme for renewable electricity by the Department which was recently published for public consultation and is expected to be in place in 2018.  It will greatly help the conversation we are having.  The subsidy support scheme is required in order to assist in meeting our renewable energy targets, as well as to facilitate greater diversity of supply and foster community engagement in renewable energy projects. <\/p> <p>The energy White Paper sets out a vision to accelerate the development and diversification of renewable energy in Ireland.  A draft REPDF has been formulated, aimed at optimising the opportunities for producing electricity from a variety of renewable energy sources in projects of significant scale on land.  It will be subject to further public consultation prior to its adoption.  A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to facilitate the development of solar energy projects in Ireland that builds on the energy White Paper and recognises that solar energy also has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby further enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future.  Consequently, solar technology such as solar farms is one of the technologies being considered in the context of the new subsidy support scheme for renewable electricity generation being developed by the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  In this connection, it is recognised that the new subsidy support scheme is required in order for the development of solar farms to become economically viable, which is not the case in most circumstances.  The new subsidy support scheme will require Government approval and state-aid clearance from the European Commission before it can come into operation.<\/p> <p>I have no proposals to bring forward specific planning guidelines for solar farms  However, the matter will be kept under review.  Certainly, on foot of the work being done by the Minister, it is something on which we can follow through, if need be.  What the Senator raised is often cited locally as an issue, but it is not a reason.  Planners in local authorities, if they have the co-operation of those authorities and their members, are well capable of making these decisions to allow us to move forward in this area.  Naturally, if we have to act following the work of the Minister, we will do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#D00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>That was a very comprehensive response.

The real guidelines will apply when the actual tariffs are set by the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, as they will determine what will be built.  Developments will be built according to what is financially viable.  If the tariff is too high, every development might be built, but if it is too low, we will have none built.  In many ways, what could actually emerge is that the planning guidelines will be associated with the actual tariff announced by the Minister after the consultation process he announced last month.  I will still be pressing for planning guidelines which have to be produced. Having developments of the scale in question, on 200 acre sites and no national guidelines, does not make sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#D00400","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I support and encourage solar farm developments.

With regard to respite services, there are over 360,000 people who act as carers.  They have been very badly affected by funding cuts and staff shortages.  The result is that many carers are often left in a position in which they have no time off, which is having a negative impact on their physical and mental health.  The report by Family Carers Ireland reveals that the lack of support, including the reduction in respite services, was leaving many carers struggling.  In June of this year, our colleague, Senator Colm Burke, said the crisis in respite care will worsen if people live longer and as carers age.  Lack of respite was, as he said, an accruing problem that will not go away.<\/p> <p>HIQA inspections have resulted to date in respite centres closing down as they are not fit for purpose.  No alternatives have been offered by this Government to these families, who really appreciate these vital services.  The Taoiseach has spoken about giving back in the budget and I hope that some of the most vulnerable, the home carers, will be acknowledged and that their incredible hard work will be recognised through increased funding for respite care.  Home carers take a large amount of pressure off the HSE and this should really be recognised by the Government.  I ask the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach to come to this House to outline exactly what they intend to do to meet the needs of those who use respite services.<\/p> <p>We all know the pay negotiations between Irish Rail staff collapsed at the WRC and that rail strikes look like they are coming down the tracks.  Strikes could begin as soon as the October bank holiday weekend and this, as we know, will cause serious disruption over the coming weeks.  The two main drivers' unions are seeking pay increases of 3.75% without any associated productivity measures, and this is in line with the pay increase given to Dublin Bus workers, which seems fair enough.  It is understood that the workers were offered an increase of 1.5%, accompanied by 19 different measures, including the outsourcing of work, loss of contracted hours, relocation of staff, closure of booking offices, and new performance management systems.<\/p> <p>Mr. Dermot O'Leary, one of the chief negotiators, said that unless the staff get a credible offer, they want to see a ballot paper.  This issue has been coming down the line for a long time and it is incumbent on the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, to address it.  He has sat and done nothing for too long, and I do not believe it is credible for him not to intervene at all in this industrial relations disaster.  I call on the Minister to come to the House to explain exactly what he is doing to address this matter as doing nothing is not an option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#G00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I hope the Leader will organise a debate on national rehabilitation services in Ireland.  I have raised this on a number of occasions.  The Leader's colleagues, on the other side of the House, have raised it.  We now have a serious problem.  We have had commitments given to us in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on the delivery of beds.  There were ten beds closed at Christmas in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  We were given commitments.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, was in the House.  One will remember that we refused to approve the Order of Business for the day and eventually the Minister of State had to come in after tea on the day in question, at the Leader's request.  I thank the Leader for organising and facilitating it at the time.<\/p> <p>This matter was discussed in January and again in April, May and June of this year.  We have seen commitments that there would be a phased reopening of the ten beds.  If one examines the capacity, one notes there are fewer than 100 beds in the facility.  Therefore, some 10% of the beds were closed down under the watch of this Government this year, in January.  The bottom line is that we were then told that they would be re-opened on a phased basis, four by the summer.<\/p> <p>Yesterday I received a telephone call again from contacts in the hospital who work there who say they are totally frustrated about all the excuses and arguments about recruitment, resources, etc.  What is really more critical and a great scandal is that patients are waiting in a queue for beds trying to gain access to the national rehabilitation services in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is a pathetic debate to be talking about re-opening four of ten beds that were closed in January.  All the beds are required.<\/p> <p>There has been a plan for years about demolishing the place and building a new hospital.  Despite three or four Ministers for health and three or four relevant Ministers and Deputies in the constituency, nothing has happened.  We need a greater debate on the rehabilitation services for the whole country and on how regional services are fed into the national service at the rehabilitation hospital.  Excuses and re-opening four beds, when ten were closed in January, are an absolute disgrace.  This is an indictment of our health service.  It needs to be addressed.  Given that we now have time on our schedule in our Seanad in which to do business, we could address this important matter.  I ask that the Leader arrange for the Minister with direct responsibility for this area of government to come into the House to explain the rationale for the closures in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and, more important, the short, medium and long-term plans for a roll out of a comprehensive rehabilitation service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#G00400","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I want to say how dismayed I was yesterday over the hysterical rant from Mr. O'Donovan to my request that capital expenditure address the huge infrastructure deficit in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#G00500","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506591000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Senators"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>It was totally unacceptable and it should never happen again in this House.

Instead he engaged in a huge rant against Sinn F&eacute;in.  He should be able to come into the House as a Minister of State and address these very important issues.  I will leave it to the people of rural Ireland and the people of the west to judge how competent he is as a Minister of State making vital decisions that affect our future.  It should never be allowed to happen here and I hope it never happens again.<\/p><p>Speaking about infrastructure in the west of Ireland, I was very disappointed to read today in the <i>Tuam Herald<\/i>about Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's endorsement of the greenway between Tuam and Athenry.  We and the western rail corridor action group have been campaigning for years to bring back the train services to have proper connectivity all along the west coast.  Fianna F&aacute;il might be throwing up its hands at this and stating it will not happen and that the investment in infrastructure is not needed in the west but we in Sinn F&eacute;in will keep up the fight for rural Ireland to have proper infrastructure and proper rail services.  The excuse is used that not enough people are using the rail services but if the timetabling is not right the investment is not put into it and it is not there to suit the public.  That means the people are not able to use it.  It is just another example of Fianna F&aacute;il kowtowing to Fine Gael's neglect of the west and it is not acceptable.<\/p><p>The other issue I want to speak about today is physiotherapy.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, for bringing forward today our prebudget submission on rights and equality and prioritising people with disabilities.  We must be on the side of people with disabilities.  The measure I wish to speak about is the employment of 600 additional front-line staff, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists, and the expenditure of &euro;32.76 million to engage these extra staff who are needed.  This is vital for all areas, including the west and Mayo.  At present, we see where we do not have the physiotherapy or occupational therapy needed for children with disabilities and adults with disabilities.  They have been clinically assessed as needing weekly, and sometimes twice weekly, physiotherapy and they are not getting it.  In my area people have to do a round trip of 100 miles just to access a physiotherapist.  This is not right and it needs to be addressed.  I am very glad it is addressed in our prebudget submission, which is fully costed to show how it can be done if the Government will is there to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#H00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The first issue I wish to raise relates to articles I have read in recent days on a French law to be enacted next month.

The law will stipulate that images of models who have been altered in any way to make them appear thinner in magazines and the media must come with a caution in the text.  Getty Images has gone one step further and banned photoshopped pictures.  It is an important conversation to have because it feeds into a wider debate on the narrative and message we send young women about how they should and should not look.  Magazines should be transparent with regard to their use of photoshopped photographs.  It would be an important discussion to have.<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the issue of young people entering education through paths other than the CEO system.  A young girl contacted me recently.  The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has paid for her to study in the film academy because it believes she has talent.  The problem is the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has removed her jobseeker's allowance and will not allow her access education.  This young woman from west Tallaght is trying to work her way out of poverty, but she is left with no alternative but to give up the course or continue it without any payment to survive.  This begs the question as to how we move people off the live register.  Instead of looking to the Department of Education and Skills perhaps we could bring in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to discuss its role in access to education and moving people out of poverty.

The term of Philip Gaffney, chairman of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, expired on 8 July 2017.  The term of Aidan Murphy, chairman of Bus &Eacute;ireann, expired on 9 July 2017.  The term of John Fitzgerald, a member of the National Transportation Authority, expired on 31 May 2017.  The term of Vivienne Jupp as chairman of CIE expired on 9 July 2014, which is a bit worrying.  The term of John Power, chairman of the Railway Safety Advisory Council, expired on 30 September 2017.  These are very concerning.  It has been flagged since we had strikes in the Luas that there is huge dissatisfaction in transport, on the very basis that we have a Minister who is quite happy to spout on about public appointments rather than make them.  Three of those posts were dealt with at the most recent Cabinet meeting, but the appointees have yet to go before the committees.<\/p> <p>We have ended up with a Minister who has no interest whatsoever in being the Minister with responsibility for transport.  He is either inept or incompetent or he just does not care.  We need action because people depend on public transport to get to work every day.  We need a good public transport service if we are to deal with the climate crisis facing Ireland.  The transport sector has been increasing its carbon footprint over the past two years but we have seen little or no action.

It could be a very interesting debate to have.<\/p><p>The annual report of the National Office for Suicide Prevention was launched yesterday.  It was stated that while the number of suicides has stabilised in recent years, there is still an alarming number of people taking their own lives and self harming.  I came across an interesting model that has been introduced in Michigan in the United States called a zero suicide model, which has been introduced in hospitals and clinics, whereby once people present themselves in a clinic or hospital, even if it is for a broken ankle or some sort of a virus, they are assessed by being asked a few simple questions, which would be indicators as to the state of their mental health and if any issues are identified they are then referred on.  It is just part of the overall process.  According to UNICEF, Ireland has the fourth highest rate of teen suicide in the European Union.  In recent years there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of suicides among mental health patients, lowering well below the national average in Michigan.  In just over a decade, the implementation of this model has resulted in a drop in suicide by mental health patients from 89 people in 100,000 to 16 people in 100,000.  That is a very significant reduction and many health insurance companies have given it their backing.  I think it is a very interesting proposal.  By assessing all patients as having potential mental health risk, whatever their reasons for being in hospital, suicide prevention can receive a significant boost.   If the Minister of Sate with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Jim Daly comes to the House, this would be an interesting aspect of mental health to discuss with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#H00700","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>As Members will be aware, this week has been designated Positive Aging Week.

It seems to me that we have a rash of proposals for constitutional change now.  Stephen Collins in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today queries whether we should scrap the Constitution completely as there are so many amendments being proposed to it.<\/p><p>The Constitution is not some kind of message board for a Government that floats ideas to distract us from the real issues.  The Constitution is the basic set of rules by which this society is operated.  It does not need to be tinkered with constantly.  Let me take one example, and I am sure I will offend some people in the House who are on the side of political correctness, the idea of giving votes to people at the age of 16 years is rubbish.  If it is illegal to sell a person of 16 years a scratch card for the national lottery, if they cannot go into a public house, if they are incapable of entering into a contract in law, and if the asylum seekers of 16 years are counted as children, the idea of giving children a vote is nonsense.  It is a distraction.  Furthermore it will be defeated comprehensively in the same way as the foolish idea of reducing the age of the presidential candidates from 35 years to 21 years was defeated by the people.  We need less of this gimmickry nonsense.  The proposal to abolish the Seanad was not taken out of any conviction, it was a pure voting getting stunt at a particular time in Fine Gael's internal politics, nothing more.  I suggest that instead of taking all of these proposals seriously and talking about rafts of referendums in the next number of years, we get on with governing this country under the present Constitution.  The present Constitution is preventing us from doing nothing at the moment that we want to do.  There is no provision in the present Constitution, perhaps with the exception of the eighth amendment, which we are dealing with, that is impeding the proper governance of this country.  All of this projecting on to the Constitution wish lists of socially desirably things is fundamentally mistaken.  To give to the Judiciary any function whatsoever in determining the allocation of resources between housing and health is probably one of the most stupid ideas that has ever been canvassed by anybody.

There is a major problem in that some of the works have now resulted in the closure of a road between Rush and Skerries and this is providing very difficult.  In conjunction with Irish Water, they put in place a shuttle bus service, but I would like to know why Dublin Bus is not bringing the bus to Rush which it used to do historically and turn around down near the health centre.  What has really upset people is that there is no shuttle bus to link the Nitelink to Rush and all the people who are working on shift work in Dublin Airport and many other areas now have no means of getting home late at night.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Perhaps when the Minister is here he might address that issue also.

Many Members know that we are only due to sit for two days next week.  In that context, surely before the Government side moves the motion, we should have a debate on the issue.  This is a debating chamber, is it not?  It was the last time I checked.  To use a phrase the Leader likes to use, I do not wish to divide the House.  If he is willing to grant us time next week to debate the matter, we will not push our amendment to a vote.  It is entirely inappropriate to push a motion such a this without debating it.  It makes a mockery of the eighth report of the Convention on the Constitution.  Senator James Reilly mentioned the importance of debate in the Chamber.  Surely, therefore, we can all agree that before the eighth report of the convention is pushed to the finance committee, effectively to consider the important matters referred to on a cost basis, we should have a debate on the matter.  I ask the Leader to be reasonable and recognise the fact that we have an extra day for debate next week.  Will he allow a debate to take place so as not to divide the House on the matter?  We disagree fundamentally with the proposition put forward by the Government.

If I am wrong, I am sure the Leader will be generous enough to say we can debate the matter next week with the extra time available.

It is the very pressing matter of farm safety and farm-related deaths.  Unfortunately, last week there were two more fatalities, bringing the total to 17 for the year gone by.  As somebody who is very involved in the national ploughing championships, it is telling that on the first day of that event, one of the deaths was of Mr. Martin Kehoe, a former ploughing champion.  I extend my sympathy to all of the families that have suffered a bereavement through a farm accident, particularly the Kehoe family in County Wexford.<\/p> <p>I tried to have the issue of farm safety examined and discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food.  I was told that it was not possible to discuss it as the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, came within the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  I do not want to use the phrase too loosely, but on the day I got the impression that we were playing football with such a serious issue which to an extent has been kicked to touch by the agriculture committee as apparently it falls to be discussed by the Minister with responsibility for enterprise and employment.  It might be unprecedented, but I ask the Leader to bring both Ministers to the House for a full and frank debate on the matter.  We must stop kicking the ball and receive an action plan from both Departments.  The HSA may come within the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, but this is an agricultural matter.  It is no longer acceptable to be told on going to one side that we should be at the other.  There have been 17 deaths and we have not yet reached 1 October.  Something must be done.  I have raised the matter on numerous occasions.  A previous committee which was chaired by the Cathaoirleach produced a fantastic report that I have read and it included an action plan to promote farm safety.  However, it is sitting on a shelf somewhere and no action is being taken.<\/p> <p>When the Leader meets the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I ask him to plead strongly with the Minister to extend the slurry spreading deadline from 15 October.  This is related to my last point, as issues such calendar dates and deadlines put farmers under pressure.  We are all aware of the extremely inclement weather conditions we have had in the past fortnight and three weeks, in particular.  They put farmers under pressure to do work that is unsuitable.  Slurry spreading must be carried out by 15 October, which increases the risk of accidents and fatalities occurring.  Elements such as this could be changed as they are not major milestones.  Moving a date on the calendar would eliminate the added risk in farmers having to finish a job by a certain date which they cannot do because of weather conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#K00600","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Tac&aacute;im leis an leas&uacute; a chuir an Seanad&oacute;ir Gavan.

We might debate the matter if the Leader agrees, but just in case he does not, it is baffling why such a comprehensive report would be referred to the finance committee alone.  What is it going to examine the issue of cultural and linguistic rights, for example?  There is a much more appropriate committee to which the report should be referred.  It should be broken down into the various appropriate elements to be referred to committees.  As Senator Paul Gavan rightly pointed out, we are due to sit for only two days next week and we only came back this week.  Members of this Chamber rather glibly and in an ill-informed fashion have told Sinn F&eacute;in to get back to work in the Assembly in the North.  We need to get back to work properly in this institution.  It is not good enough that, as a House of the Oireachtas, we will sit for two days next week after only returning this week.

Five years is not sufficient time to allow them to plan for the identification of the local community's school needs or to devise an appropriate response strategy, including the design and delivery of training and development programmes for teachers and the wider school community at local level.  Nor is it enough time to build capacity to ensure good governance and effective financial management of the centre, or to manage centre staff to allow them to reach their potential and contribute meaningfully to the development of the centre.<\/p><p>Building and developing networks and sustainable relations and organising continuing professional development for teachers and education personnel are core to the work of a director so I am looking for a debate on this.  I will put down an amendment to change the provision under which a secondment cannot exceed five school years, with a section saying the position of education centre director is a seconded position for leading and managing CPD provision within the Department of Education and Skills CPD framework.  Secondment will be for an initial period of five years with the right to reapply for a consecutive further five years.<\/p><p>The Minister for Education and Skills has already granted this principle with regard to teachers because, in reply to a parliamentary question, he said such extensions may apply where a seconded teacher is engaged in a leadership role and has a specialism or expertise where retention is necessary for continuity, quality planning and management.  He said that the implementation of this policy is a matter for the services concerned and the relevant sections of his Department.  The parallel with teachers and the education centre director is very clear and the Minister has stated, on the record, that the reappointment of a director of a public body for a second term is consistent with Government policy applying to public bodies generally.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to make provision for debate so that this matter can be discussed and the appropriate amendment tabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#K00800","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I wish to raise something that is connected to debate in general.

We live in a democracy and a major issue will be facing the electorate in a referendum next May or June, according to the Taoiseach.  The referendum should go before the people in a manner that is acceptable to everyone.  The debate should be considered, all views need to be taken into consideration and no one's opinion should be greater than another's.

There has been talk that he is considering upping the rate from 9% to 10% or 12% but I have serious concerns with this.  This is a sector that has been a really great story for the Government, which has had great success in the way it has handled it.  There are some problems and some hotels will not be happy until they eat the goose that lays the golden egg with their prices, and there are some rogue hotels in this regard.  This is very evident in the reduction in numbers from Britain.  There have been fluctuations in the currency and Brexit, among other things, has had an effect but the pricing of hotel rooms is a major factor.  I call on the Leader to talk to the Minister about this.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland has professionally costed a 1% rise from 9% to 10% and learned that it would cost 6,000 jobs - a substantial number.  If rogue hotels are overcharging, the Minister could tackle this in better ways than upping the VAT rate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#L00300","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I support Senator Freeman's call in respect of 16-18 year olds in our mental health service with nowhere to go.

I met the very fine people that are in a group, Unbroken, this morning.  All of them have a personal story to tell that connects in with the horror of rape and the very difficult subject of abortion.  To think that people who generously give of their time and courageously tell their story, which is not an easy thing to do, would be denied the opportunity of doing so in a public space, like a hotel, because of highly manipulative and abusive campaigning behind the scenes to deprive them of a platform is horrific.  The situation does connect in with a wider problem in western society, and it happens here in Ireland.  I refer to the tendency to give no platform to people one disagrees with.  I happen to know that the Gibson Hotel, the Spencer Hotel and I think, in the context of another gathering that touched on the abortion issue from a pro-life perspective, the Ashling Hotel, have all found themselves cancelling events and denying space in recent days to groups.  I do not think any of those groups were in the business of saying or doing anything disruptive.  They were telling their truth, as they see it, according to the facts as they have them.<\/p> <p>I intend to take this matter further.  I will try to talk to people of goodwill, who may or may not agree with my point of view on these issues, to see can we draw attention to the danger of free speech and respectful debate that does exist when something like this happens.  I personally feel that the media is lacking.  If the shoe were on the other foot and the media was on a different side of the argument this situation would be all over the Joe Duffy show.  Whether I am right or wrong on that aspect, I ask people who disagree with me to at least join with me in saying that people must be allowed access to public space.  Campaigns of this kind, that are designed to deprive people of a platform, pressurising hotel managers using social media, and perhaps telling untruths about the groups that propose to meet, are utterly unhelpful and is not going to be good for our society. <\/p> <p>I will briefly outline what I came here to say today.  There is something tragic about the fall from grace by Aung San Suu Kyi.  Even more tragic is the plight of the Rohingya Muslims and the horrors that have taken place.  In Myanmar, some 400,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled.  We have heard stories of soldiers raping women, decapitating children and setting whole villages ablaze.  Ms Aung San Suu Kyi was a hero of democracy and in many ways is still the best hope for democracy in that country.  She has found herself unable to stand up to the military to the point of being disingenuous.  She has condemned human rights abuses in general but failed to talk about the specifics.  It is a tragedy for her and it is a tragedy for Myanmar.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has spoken on this issue.  It is of such importance that we should debate it in this House.  I hope that a debate can be arranged in early course with the Minister attending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#M00400","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I will begin by referencing the ridiculous comparison drawn by Senator McDowell between gambling and alcohol with voting.

I am happy for him to come to the House to discuss a variety of transport issues as Senator Reilly asked.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of respite care and struck a very important note with which I completely agree.  In the forthcoming budget it is absolutely important that the emerging fruits of the economy are spent on people in a way that has tangible benefits and, in particular, for carers, whether family members or paid carers, and also those who require respite care, as mentioned by the Senator.  There is an absolute need for further investment in that area.  I know from discussions with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, that the issue of older people is being considered in the context of the budget because it is important, as Senator Murnane-O'Connor rightly said, that we acknowledge the contribution that senior citizens have made to society and the community.  All Members know people in respite care or in need of home care and who have needs that are not currently being met.  We must ensure that the moneys we have in an economy that is now growing is spent wisely and prudently on people.  The point that is being made and should be made is that now, if one looks at what the Government has done in terms of budgets in recent years, is that the Oireachtas,  without the support of the Seanad because Members of the Opposition did not support Senators being included on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, has a long-term vision for health and investment in it.  It is important to note that all ESRI reports reference the demand on our health service.  The former Minister for Health, Senator Reilly, was very clear in his approach about people being treated at home, living longer at home in their own environment and it is important that we address that.  It is equally important that strategies and plans are put in place in terms of the carer and respite care aspects of health care.  Senator Devine referenced disability and it is also important that we spend money in that area.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, as has Senator Hopkins in the past.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to address that issue.  I cannot give Senator Boyhan an answer on the issue of beds in that hospital but the point he raises regarding rehabilitation and a national rehabilitation plan needs to be actively pursued.<\/p> <p>I am not sure if Senator Conway-Walsh wants me to bring the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy O'Donovan, back to the House.

As Members know, that plays on people's minds and the Senators are right to raise the issue.  Senator Warfield referenced young people's issues yesterday and today.  It is important that there be a debate in the House on youth services, young people and issues that affect them because those will be huge issues for society.  If one looks at what is happening on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter - the latter to a lesser degree because young people do not use it as much, although I may be in trouble for saying that - both Senators are correct that it is a huge issue that requires discussion and an action plan because it has an effect on of how people see themselves.  I welcome Senator Freeman back to the House.  She is working in this area, to which I will return.  I would be happy to have that debate.  It is urgently required.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane also referenced the issue of access to education.  I am a former director of education, and spoke last week at the third UNESCO international conference on learning cities which took place in Cork city and was attended by delegates from over 80 countries.  I am aware of the importance of returning to education or empowering people to go out to the workplace and better themselves and get a job.  I do not have the details the Senator mentioned but if they are given to me, I will pass them to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, because people must be allowed to be progress.  The issue raised by the Senator is disappointing and I would be happy to pursue it for her.<\/p> <p>Senator Noone also made reference to the issue of mental health and Senators Freeman and Devine referenced the issue of 16 to 18 year olds not being catered for.  A Seanad Public Consultation Committee report is soon due on the issue of mental health.  All Senators will agree there are many factors, including the good work being done by the charitable sector, including Pieta House, in the area of mental health and suicide.  It is important that we invest and try to prevent the tragic deaths of young people in our communities.  I would be happy to have a debate on that issue when the report is completed.<\/p> <p>Senator Murnane-O'Connor spoke on promoting Positive Ageing Week and that it is important the budget be a fair one that reflects the needs of our older citizens.  I am sure the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will do that in his budget speech.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell made a very eloquent address on constitutional reform.

In saying that, Senator McDowell is right that there are referenda that can be held that are meaningless and pointless, and that will be the debate we will have on the different propositions being put to the people.  I do not think we can be afraid to amend the Constitution if we think it needs to be amended, but that is a debate we can have.

I am all for freedom of speech and assembly and I cannot answer for the hotels.  In our own case, as a political party, a hotel cancelled an event that we were having.  That is part of the life we live, unfortunately.  Senator Mullen said that there is a need to have a respectful debate on any issue to allow for different viewpoints, in particular on the issue of the eighth amendment, which he referenced.  That is about the language we use and the way we present arguments.  That applies to all sides, whether in committee meetings, on the airwaves, in this Chamber or at public meetings.<\/p> <p>On the point made by Senators Ruane and Noone about young people and magazines, it is equally important that we behave in a respectful manner on social media and do not drive people away from debate and encourage them to be involved in debate.

We should have that debate in a respectful, tolerant manner.<\/p> <p>To reply to Senator Davitt, the VAT rate is one that the previous Government introduced to act as a catalyst to get the economy moving.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland, RAI, has a lobby day today in advance of the budget.  We should reflect upon the value of the 9% rate in the context of a post-Brexit scenario where we have seen a decline in tourists from the UK.  What would happen if we got rid of or amended the 9% rate?  Those involved in the hospitality sector also have a duty with regard to pricing, whether accommodation or menu prices.  I think Senator Davitt will agree that he has seen an increase in prices of hotel rooms and menus and one wonders where the 9% VAT rate is going or who it is going to.  We will have that debate in advance of the budget.

I know how hard he works and it is important that we all work together to ensure homelessness can be sorted.  It is a year since the Government launched its Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  Recent trends include the lack of progress on new social housing construction, continued rent inflation, reduced rental supply and house price inflation in 2017.  The figures in the Government's social housing construction report suggest fewer than 800 new social homes will be constructed in 2017, when the action plan targets 5,000.  Only 24% of housing units in the construction pipeline are actually on site, meaning it will be 2021 before the full total of 10,072 units come on-stream.  This compares with targets, which are, frankly, too low, of 26,000 new units by 2021.<\/p> <p>The Government strategy is to rely almost exclusively on the private rental market to provide all social housing through the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rent supplement.  I addressed this with the Minister this morning.  I have massive concerns about this.  Of course, the very negative downside to this strategy is that no new housing stock is being added and that existing housing stock is being taken from the private rental and owner-occupier markets.<\/p> <p>In terms of total housing supply, Ireland now needs to build 40,000 to 50,000 new homes per year to make a dent on the increased demands and make a noticeable impact on affordability.  Clearly there is a market failure in housing and new interventions are required to stimulate supply, but the Government seems reluctant to make any interventions in the housing market and seems to be determined to stick to its message that all will be well by 2019, when it expects the output of new housing to reach 20,000 units.  This attitude has to change if the real challenges are to be tackled.<\/p> <p>The number of families and children living in emergency accommodation continues to rise.  Meanwhile rents continue to rise at a dramatic rate.  While house prices are rising quickly, they are still 40% below their 2007 peak, whereas rental prices have long surpassed their peak, with average rents now more than 12% above 2008 levels.  The rent pressure zones should be nationwide.  All local authorities should have them.  The emergency housing crisis needs to be addressed.  With regard to the cap to qualify for local authority housing, if people do not get on the housing list they either need to get support through a mortgage from the local authority or be able to go to their local credit union and get a loan.  We need to ensure people do not fall between the local authority housing lists and paying private rent every month of up to &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,500, which they just cannot afford.<\/p> <p>I want to ask the Minister about NAMA.  What is the status of NAMA?  I do not know and I hear different things.  Is it holding on to properties and sites and not releasing them for social housing?  Can we have a full update on what exactly is happening with NAMA?  I would appreciate it.<\/p> <p>I urge fast action.  The current social housing policy needs to be changed.  We need to look at why it is not working.  We need common sense, decisions and plans.  I and my Fianna F&aacute;il party colleagues urge a sense of urgency.  Many times over, barriers have been placed to housing the most vulnerable in our country and these barriers need to be removed.  We have empty houses, delays and long waiting lists.  Years pass and people's lives change, as do their needs.  These barriers become our enemies because of this timescale.  People are waiting and waiting.  It is like an enemy.  I often say that plans are great but that by the time we get to their fruition more problems exist.  We have a homelessness crisis and our biggest enemy is time.  Nobody needs to die on our streets and we need to work together fast to ensure it does not happen again.  We need to deliver positive outcomes for people and we need to do it now and not down the road.  We have committee meetings every week and I know from working with various Departments there will be change, but slow change.  The people unable to qualify for local authority housing lists are crying out for help and I do not think they receive it.  I ask the Minister to ensure everybody is entitled to a home and that we give the people of Ireland a chance to ensure they have a home they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#W00300","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>There are many different factors in the housing shortage and homelessness issue confronting us at present, but one I want to particularly emphasise is one which I do not see echoed anywhere in any of the Government statements thus far, and I hope it will be looked on and some attention given to it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> One of the major problems we face is housing and rebuilding the city of Dublin.  That is where the major problems exist.  People will say I am taking a Dublin-centred view of the matter but homelessness and the pressure on rents, land values and the like in Dublin are probably the most acute in the country.  The Ballymun regeneration plan was not a success.  It was an exercise in town planning by Dublin City Council which has not succeeded.  Although the problems in old Ballymun such as they were have been addressed to some extent, Ballymun is not now functioning as a new quarter in which to live in Dublin successfully.  Retail units are boarded up.  It is not working.  The message I took from that is that it is all very well for Dublin City Council to look at its own estate, for instance, Charlemont Street, Dolphin House, O'Devaney Gardens or other places, and say that they can be redeveloped and that it has plans for them.  It is all very well to do that, but concentrating only on publicly owned lands and decaying public housing projects is not the answer to getting Dublin to function as a city.  We need a body - I believe Dublin City Council cannot do it for various reasons to which I will return - the job of which will be to regenerate the entire city of Dublin, to look at entire blocks, precincts, neighbourhoods, places where there is dereliction and places where the density in housing is far too low and to come up with plans such as the wide street commissioners did in the 18th century to plan out new streets, new developments and plan for the social infrastructure that is in place.  That is what is needed now.  We have the schools, theatres, shopping precincts and all the rest of it in Dublin, yet I saw in one of today's newspapers a major development by the Hines company planned for Cherrywood.  It is building a whole new town with hundreds upon hundreds of apartments, which it will keep under its control, running to thousands of dwellings.  That is all very well but where we need regeneration is in the city.  Putting people out in Abbottstown or at the end of the Luas line is not the way to rebuild Dublin.  <\/p><p>The second point I want to make is that private property rights under the Constitution are no barrier whatsoever to the kind of thing I am talking about.  The third point I want to make is that no decent city such as Paris or wherever was ever built entirely by leaving it to market forces.  I have no problem with the Government looking at the land that is most easily available and going for the low hanging fruit in the midst of a crisis, going for lands like the Glass Bottle Company site and for space that seems to be derelict, but if we want to address the problems of Dublin as a city, we need an urban regeneration body for Dublin.  We need a process whereby people can be compulsorily bought out and entire parts of Dublin city can be redeveloped to a different standard and to different models.<\/p><p>I will return to the point of why Ballymun regeneration was such a failure.  Dublin City Council had all the powers, owned all the land, had all the opportunity to rebuild a successful suburb in Dublin.  It is depressing to look at how much of a failure it was.  I have always been sceptical about Dublin City Council's capacity to plan anything.  We should remember that Charlemont Street flats, which Senator Humphreys and the Minister visited the other day, were built in my lifetime and they are being knocked down now.  Who were the geniuses who put them up to knock them down?  I believe I am younger than Dolphin House but not much younger than it.  Those were all built within two generations and they are all being knocked down now.  Dublin City Council's own head office is a monument to appalling planning.  Ballymun is a monument to its failure.  We need something other than Dublin City Council to plan and implement a regeneration of Dublin city.  <\/p><p>It is important for the development of this country that Dublin should be regenerated at its heart.  If we want the IFSC to function properly as a capital city and to bring in people to live in Dublin, we cannot have a situation where a person who is contemplating coming to Dublin to live has to fork out &euro;1 million for a fairly modest house close to their place of work.  The success of this country depends on somebody with a vision taking a look at Dublin and saying this is how the city will be developed over the next ten, 15, 20 or 30 years.  That is not being done, and will not be done.<\/p><p>The Minister correctly called in all the city managers and asked them for progress reports.  I hope he laid down the law to them in private, namely, that they had to do more.  They engage in the usually bellyache that they have no resources.  Resources are not the problem.  The resources will come.  If we have a regeneration body which can parcel out land and give building leases, the resources are not the problem.  Resources, for instance, were not the problem in Charlemont Street where the Minister visited recently.  Resources will come and society has to decide whether it will have X% or Y% of new developments, social and affordable housing or purely social housing.  Those are resource issues but they are not the reason nothing is happening, and they are certainly not the reason so much of Dublin is run down, derelict and under-developed.  The one body whose job it was to make sure that did not happen is Dublin City Council.  It is ironic that it is the owners of all the worst areas in the city and that they are the people whose plans and developments in the past have been the shortest in terms of their duration and the worst in terms of their social outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#W00400","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House for this important debate.

I listened with interest to Senator McDowell's contribution which was Dublin centric.  There are many housing issues right around the country, but they are most concentrated in the largest urban area.  I have often compared Dublin to an economic vortex where a great deal of the activity in economic terms is happening, and that is rightly so as our capital, but it needs to happen in a planned and sustainable way.  I hold out great hope for the new national planning framework 2040, which the Minister is due to announce shortly.  It is my hope that the vision in that plan can be implemented in a sustainable way that will allow Dublin to develop to accommodate the needs of our people into the future and that it will also allow for other regional centres to drive the regional economies.<\/p> <p>On the planning issues Senator McDowell mentioned, I certainly would be in favour of more high rise appropriate developments in appropriate locations in Dublin, not in the Georgian quarter but there are areas in Dublin where high rise developments would be acceptable and the Minister and his officials should consider where there is sustainable development and where the services already exist.  Interventions could be made immediately in that respect.<\/p> <p>The housing crisis needs the collaboration of many stakeholders.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not need to tell the Minister that.  It is important that officials in the Minister's Department and in the Department of Finance, are aligned with the objectives he is setting out.  Members of the Oireachtas, including members of committees, play an important role in shaping and formulating the policies that emerge and enablers of those policies - local authorities and approved housing bodies - must be given the resources to deliver housing through direct build and other initiatives.  That has been happening in the past couple of years but we need to see more of it.  The delivery must be measured so that we know it is being done in the most efficient and coherent way possible and in accordance with the policy handed down by the Oireachtas and the Minister.<\/p><p>The NGOs and voluntary agencies play a role, as do elected members of local authorities.  Councillors around the country have called for more resources for housing but then, when it is allocated and ready to move, there are objections from those very same councillors.  We need to decide which way we want to go, to align all our support and push forward so that we can build the houses that are so badly needed.<\/p><p>The construction sector is a very important stakeholder.  As we know, it has been destroyed over the past number of years.  There is a huge potential for builders to access credit to build but to this day many still cannot get it from the various finance houses and banks.  Some interventions are needed to assist builders to get building and enable them to do what they do best.  It must be done in a sustainable way and we must not go back to the unsustainable practices of the past.  The new planning framework and the capital investment plan contain the tools to drive that type of development where it is most needed.<\/p><p>I welcome the recent housing summit and the re-evaluation of the Rebuilding Ireland plan because for any plan to work, it needs finances and resources.  The Minister is looking at this and I welcome some of the initiatives he has already announced, not to mention those he is due to announce.  We need to prioritise areas that can give us the earliest possible delivery of housing and vacant housing stock, in both local authorities and the private sector, needs to be focused on.  Huge progress has been made since 2014 in unlocking vacant housing stock in local authorities around the country but more initiatives are needed.  The serviced land initiative is also very important to unlock the potential of serviced lands to build houses on.  We need priorities and homelessness has to be the main priority for all of us.  Those who are at risk of losing their homes must get the support they require to stay there if possible.  The new initiatives around the mortgage-to-rent scheme are welcome but we need to constantly measure and evaluate them.<\/p><p>We also need to continue to support the homeless through wraparound services involving the HSE and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, to ensure people in complex long-term homelessness cases are getting the supports they need.  The establishment of the interagency homeless group is very welcome, because we need greater co-ordination and coherence in the deployment of taxpayers' funds at the coalface.  I understand that over &euro;100 million is being allocated to homeless services through various avenues and that a very high percentage of it goes into the voluntary sector, which does a great job.  We need further analysis of how that money is being spent, however, because despite the huge resources going into it we are not, unfortunately, seeing enough progress.  We need to measure how local authorities, approved housing bodies and any agency that accepts taxpayers' money are delivering social housing and housing solutions in a timely and efficient fashion.  We need to recognise that building does not come overnight but requires planning, funding and physical building.  We need to remove the blockages and bureaucracy about which people have spoken and continue to evaluate it.<\/p><p>I have concerns about the whole area of affordability.  We often hear about homelessness, and rightly so, but we do not hear about what I believe is a silent cohort of citizens who cannot afford a house in the current economic environment.  They are people who are working and cannot qualify for a mortgage to buy or build their own home.  They earn so much that they do not qualify for a social house through the local authority.  These people are falling between stools and they need a voice.  I want to be a voice for them.  It is important we look at housing initiatives to assist them where rental pressures are greatest, namely, in the rent pressure zones.  When they are competing for housing in those areas they also impact on the housing assistance payment, HAP, cohort and young professionals now cannot afford the rent in these areas.  We need to think outside the box and come up with new initiatives for affordable build, purchase and rent.  If we get those solutions they will bring immediate benefits, in the shape of another tier of housing provision for those who are working and by taking the pressure off HAP tenants who are also looking in the private sector.  It will also create a demand and provide funding for the builders who cannot get credit to build, unlocking their potential to increase the housing supply.<\/p><p>I do not envy the Minister his job of work but I offer him my full support.  I have been in his shoes in the past and I recognise the enormity of his challenge but I believe he is making strong progress in putting in place his plans and finance.  He will need all stakeholders to be pulling the same way with him if we are going to achieve the progress we want in social and all types of housing.  I wish him well in his endeavour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#X00400","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506591000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Here we are again, making statements, but I am really not fond of statements as we should be here for legislation.  Since the last statements in the Seanad on this issue, the homelessness figures have continued to rise, especially among children.  I am disappointed we are back to listen to the Minister accept how dreadful these figures are, to promise to do more and to undertake to come back to the Seanad at a later stage to update us on progress.  Given the urgency of the crisis, I would have expected to be here to discuss much-needed legislation to set in motion the change in policy and direction promised by his Government.  The Government is doing nothing different from three months ago and there is no major change in attitude or application.  The most worrying aspect of it is that the Government still does not fully grasp the extent of the national disgrace that is childhood homelessness.<\/p> <p>I am reluctant to use up too much time in laying bare the extent of the problem but I feel I must.  In almost every single indicator, the housing crisis is getting worse, with 8,000 people sleeping in emergency accommodation, 3,000 of whom are children, many of whom are born into homelessness not knowing anything else, such as the security and comfort of their own hearth and kin gathered around.  Many of these families with children will spend more than two years in inappropriate emergency accommodation and I have reminded the Minister repeatedly that those figures do not include adults and children in domestic refuges funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, those in step-down accommodation, the families who are couchsurfing or living in sheds or those trapped in direct provision.<\/p> <p>There were 90,000 households on the council waiting lists as of last September and I am sure those figures are rising.  In many local authority areas the length of time families are waiting  for local authority allocations can be 15 or 18 years.  Thousands of people are stuck in an affordability trap with rising rents, rising house prices and land values.  At this moment, next door to us in the National Library my party colleague, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin, is hosting a conference advocating the immediate building of social housing.  It is ironic that an Opposition party has had to gather together the relevant stakeholders and experts to discuss the best way of advancing one of the most fundamental duties of this State, which is to ensure its citizens are housed safely and securely.  More is happening outside Government circles than within them in the area of housing advocacy.  The campaign entitled, \"My Name Is\" which was organised by the inner city action on homelessness group was a brilliant visual manifestation of what the Government's failure leads to, which is young children who have no home to go to after they leave school.<\/p> <p>Also on the subject of taking up the slack, I wish to mention the wonderful initiative of Sinn F&eacute;in councillor, Shane O'Brien, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown Council where agreement has been reached to work together on the development of the innovative proposal for the Shanganagh urban village co-operative on housing development, consisting of 200 social housing apartments and 340 affordable homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017092800002#Y00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1506591000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
