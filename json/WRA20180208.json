In addition, the NTPF focus over the last two years has been on addressing Inpatient and Daycase waiting times.  However, the HSE and NTPF are working together to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2018. October's Budget announced a total 2018 allocation of &euro;55m for the NTPF for 2018.  This significant increase in funding more than doubles its 2017 total allocation of &euro;20m. <\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that the Outpatient Waiting Lists generally remains a challenge that needs to be addressed.  It is worth noting that in 2016 the children's hospitals recorded that approximately 13% of patients did not attend their Outpatient appointment.  This is something that must be tackled including through improved engagement with patients and families and ongoing validation of waiting lists.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  <\/p>  <p>  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination and can be a difficult diagnosis to make in cases which do not develop the characteristic rash.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection. These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease. <\/p>  <p>  Laboratories in Ireland generally follow the laboratory testing recommendations of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Disease Society of America, the European Federation of Neurological Societies, and the British Infection Association. Irish laboratories have their own quality assurance methods to make sure the tests are working correctly as well as being accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Body to perform the test correctly.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the UK's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory.  This laboratory uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities which involves a screening test followed by a confirmatory test.<\/p>  <p>  Testing which is performed abroad may be performed in laboratories which have not met National or International Accreditation (Quality Standards).  They tests may be more likely to give a &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; result. <\/p>  <p>   Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.

Their recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  NIAC is considering the need to expand the current recommendations for influenza vaccine, including the potential community wide benefit of extending recommendations to include all children.<\/p>  <p>  Influenza vaccine is most effective when circulating viruses are well-matched with viruses contained in vaccines.  Due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System &ndash; a system of National Influenza Centres and WHO Collaborating Centres around the world &ndash; continuously monitors the influenza viruses circulating in humans and updates the composition of influenza vaccines twice a year.  For many years, WHO has updated its recommendation on the composition of the vaccine (trivalent) that targets the three most representative virus types in circulation (two subtypes of influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus) and since the 2013&ndash;2014 northern hemisphere influenza season, a fourth component is recommended to support quadrivalent vaccine development.  Quadrivalent vaccines include a 2nd influenza B virus in addition to the viruses in trivalent vaccines<\/p>  <p>  The influenza vaccine purchased by HSE is based on WHO advice on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2017\/8 northern hemisphere Flu season issued on 2 March 2017.  It recommended that trivalent vaccines for use in the 2017-2018 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following:<\/p>  <p>  -  an A\/Michigan\/45\/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;<\/p>  <p>  -  an A\/Hong Kong\/4801\/2014 (H3N2)-like virus; and<\/p>  <p>  -  a B\/Brisbane\/60\/2008-like virus.<\/p>  <p>  This season (2017\/18) the HSE procured the trivalent inactivated Influenza vaccine (Split Virion) BP seasonal influenza vaccine for all those in the recommended at risk groups and health care workers and carers.  The trivalent vaccine used in Ireland is the most widely used influenza vaccine in Europe.  Initial evidence suggests that the vaccine provides higher protection against the Influenza A strains than recent years (H3N2 &amp;amp; H1N1).  While it is less effective against the B strains predominating this year, people who received the flu.  Vaccination remains the most effective means of preventing infection by seasonal influenza viruses and can reduce severe disease that can lead to hospitalisation and death.

Section 39 legally underpins the provision of services similar or supplementary to a service that the HSE may provide.  In 2017, the HSE provided funding of approximately<i><\/i>&euro;800 million to over 2,200 of these agencies.  The funding provided can range from high value, in their millions, to relatively modest amounts of just a few hundred euro.  <\/p><p>Staff in these organisations were not subject to the provisions of FEMPI legislation.  They were not a party to the Public Service Agreements and are not covered by the pay restoration provided for in these Agreements.  While it is understood that pay savings were made by the organisations, the precise mix of pay cuts or other savings measures will have varied.  Also, where there were pay cuts, it is not at all clear that they were applied in a universally consistent manner, as is the case in the public sector.<\/p><p>Therefore, the Government believes that we need a much deeper understanding of the funding position in these grant - aided organisations and the true extent of the pay reductions applied.  In establishing the position, I am obliged to have regard to the legitimate taxpayer and value for money issues that arise.  That is why I have requested that the HSE engages with the Section 39 organisations to establish the facts around what cuts were applied and how and when they were implemented.  A plan then needs to be developed in relation to possible solutions and their implementation.  I have asked that the Executive complete this exercise as soon as practicable, having regard to the large number of organisations concerned.  Officials from my Department and the Executive are continuing to engage with the relevant trade unions to ensure that this work is carried out on a consensus basis.<\/p><p>I am very mindful of the threatened industrial action in a number of these organisations, which is scheduled to commence with a one day work stoppage on 14 February 2018.

While this is under development, both the Department and HSE keep these services under ongoing review and are continuing efforts to incrementally improve the existing home care services.  As detailed in its <i>National Service Plan,<\/i>the HSE has begun work on streamlining home care services by moving towards a single funded home support service.  This brings together the funding for home help and standard home care packages which will operate as a single home support service from 2018 onwards.  This new approach will provide significant benefits for the service users, the public and the health system including: <\/p><p>-  making the services easier to understand; <\/p><p>-  streamlining the application processes resulting in only one application and decision being required for home support services for older people; and <\/p><p>-  facilitating service users to move to changed levels of services as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.<\/p><p>Home support services are a particular area of focus in Budget 2018, with an additional &euro;18.25m allocated.  The additional resources made available in 2018 bring the total budget for the direct provision of home support services to &euro;408m.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan provides for a target of some 17.094m home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people.  This compares with the projected 16.34m hours delivered to 50,000 people last year, home help and home hours combined.  This is an increase of 754,000 hours to 500 more people.  In addition 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.  <\/p><p>Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for Home Care continues to grow.

A majority of Committee members recommended that change is needed to extend the grounds for lawful termination of pregnancy in the State, and that in order to effect change Article 40.3.3 should be removed from the Constitution.  However, diverging from the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly&rsquo;s view which believed Article 40.3.3 should be replaced in the Constitution with a provision giving exclusive authority to the Oireachtas to legislate on the issue of abortion, the Joint Committee recommended that Article 40.3.3 be repealed <i>simpliciter<\/i>.<\/p><p>At a special Cabinet meeting on 29 January, the Government approved the holding of a referendum on Article 40.3.3 in early summer 2018 subject to the timely passage of a Constitutional Amendment Bill on the matter by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>I will now prepare a Referendum Bill to amend the Constitution.

In July 2013 a Working Group, chaired by Prof. Brian MacCraith, President, Dublin City University, was established to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structure.  The Group made 25 recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a focus on improving graduate retention in the public health system and planning for future service needs.  Initiatives taken on foot of the Group's recommendations include the launch of a  careers and training website, which gives information about each specialty, including details of training pathways and training duration, increasing the number of family friendly training places and the appointment of lead NCHDs across sites.  The MacCraith Implementation Monitoring Group continues its work and has identified the need to progress other key recommendations including protected training time, task transfer and better coverage of training costs incurred by  NCHDs.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to nurses, the number of nurses and midwives has increased by 942 in the 12 months ending December 2017 to 36,777 whole time equivalents and by 2,599 in the 4 years since December 2013.  In terms of the number of nurses required in public hospitals, the Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement, was concluded with the INMO and SIPTU Nursing last year.  This committed the HSE to increasing the number of nurses and midwives by 1,224 additional permanent posts across the health service in 2017.  Indications are that there has been significant growth in the appointment of nurses and midwives in recent months with 942 WTE of the 1,224 posts filled (including student nurses).

No regulatory action has been taken to date by Competent Authorities in any European country in respect of these devices.<\/p><p>The  HPRA has also consulted with a number of clinical experts in this field.  The advice of Dr. Suzanne O&rsquo;Sullivan, President Continence Foundation of Ireland (<i>www.continence.ie<\/i>) and Consultant Obstetrician and Urogynaecologist in Cork University Maternity Hospital is that &ldquo;The MUS [mid-urethral sling] has become the operation of choice in Europe, Asia, North and South America and Australasia for treatment of stress urinary incontinence with several million procedures performed worldwide.  Whilst each patient differs in terms of symptoms, background medical history, optimal treatment approaches may differ.  Relative to other procedures mid urethral slings have been shown, in large studies from all over the world, to be no less safe (and usually more safe) than other procedures and with improved short, medium and long-term outcomes.  These mesh slings have major advantages of shorter operating and admission times, and a quicker return to normal activities together with lower rates of complications&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The safety of surgical meshes used in urogynecological surgery has also been reviewed in Europe by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).  SCENIHR was requested to provide a scientific Opinion on the safety of surgical meshes used in contemporary pelvic surgery.  The Opinion of the SCENIHR was approved in December 2015 and is available, together with a summary of the outcome, on the website of the European Commission<i>. <\/i><\/p><p>The SCENIHR summary outlines that &lsquo;clinical outcome following mesh implantation is influenced by material properties, product design, overall mesh size, route of implantation, patient characteristics, associated procedures (e.g. hysterectomy) and the surgeon&rsquo;s experience&rsquo;. <\/p><p>SCENIHR states that &lsquo;synthetic sling SUI surgery is an accepted procedure with proven efficacy and safety in the majority of patients with moderate to severe SUI, when used by an experienced and appropriately trained surgeon.

There are many very valuable service providers in the mental health sphere, however, I feel accessing these services can be simplified by having one access point nationally.

The proposed service will focus on preventing mental health problems from developing and escalating, and on promoting good mental health through empowering people to self-manage their mental well-being.  There is strong evidence that those seeking information\/support are moving away from seeking help-line support and towards digital technologies.

The GP may then make recommendations which may include referral to the secondary care mental health services for full eating disorder assessment.<\/p>  <p>  Nationally, outpatient mental health services for adults presenting with eating disorders are provided by the General Adult Mental Health Teams across the country.  Similarly, children and adolescents with eating disorders are treated by the Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Mental Health Service teams.  Specialist training in the treatment of eating disorders has been provided to some clinicians from those teams as part of the National Clinical Programme in Eating Disorders.<\/p>  <p>  Although most people with eating disorders do not require inpatient care, where an individual&rsquo;s needs are more acute, inpatient admission may be required following the recommendation of the Consultant Psychiatrist or physician.  When the risk is primarily physical and the person is in need of physical safety monitoring while re-feeding, admission will be to a HSE acute hospital under the care of a physician or paediatrician.  Currently there are Specialist Eating Disorder services for adults (including in-patient bed provision) at St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in Dublin, and for children at Linn Dara Services also in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently developing a Clinical Programme in Eating Disorders.  The HSE recognises that although eating disorders are managed and treated by existing mental health services, these services may need support, particularly with high risk, severe and complex presentations.  The Clinical Programme will help to develop greater capacity to manage people with eating disorders in the community, in order to reduce the likelihood of acute hospital treatment.  As part of this Programme, a collaborative Model of Care was formally launched in January 2018.  This includes a stepped model of care delivery; a  specialist training programme for existing outpatient mental health services; a new  dedicated National Eating Disorder Network; specialised inpatient Eating Disorder programmes within  key  existing psychiatric units nationally; and additional  levels of care provided by the dedicated eating disorder network teams. <\/p>  <p>  When this new collaborative Model of Care is implemented, there will be a national network of specialist eating disorder community team-based services and access to an enhanced level of special treatment beds.

Section 6A provides that a person born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding his\/her birth.<\/p>  <p>  In such cases, proofs of lawful residence in the State are required to determine if a parent has the required three year residence.  For non-EU parents, permission to remain in the State recorded on passports, and\/or registration cards, as issued by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), are acceptable proofs of a parent&rsquo;s lawful residence in the context of a passport application.<\/p>  <p>  In this case, the applicant&rsquo;s parent did not provide proof of lawful residence in the State for the required time-period prior to the child&rsquo;s birth.  Without such proof of lawful residence, an entitlement to citizenship and therefore eligibility for an Irish passport, was not established. <\/p>  <p>  Citizenship &ndash; including naturalisation &ndash; comes under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality (Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service) and further information is available on the website www.inis.gov.ie<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800055#WRE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategic Communications Unit","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800055#WRE02700"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[6525\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800055#WRE02800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he, his officials or advisers have had meetings with the strategic communication unit since it was set up; the issues that were discussed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":286,"content":"<p>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 449 of 7 November 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Since then, officials and advisors from my Department have continued to engage with the Government Strategic Communications Unit [SCU] at the Department of the Taoiseach on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  Formal meetings have included those of the Assistant Secretary-level Delivery Team Network of all Government Departments chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, as well those in workshop format on themes such as overall Ireland-related messaging at international level and the visual identities of Government Departments.<\/p>  <p>  Informal meetings and contacts have also taken place between officials and advisors from my Department and the Government Strategic Communications Unit at various levels on these and other communications-related topics. <\/p>  <p>  The SCU Director has also participated in events such as the Team Ireland conference &ndash; co-organised by my Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and involving a wide range of other Government Departments and State agencies - held at Croke Park on 16 November 2017.

A range of analysis has taken place within the Department of Finance, the NTMA and the Central Bank, and\u00a0through inter-institutional groups, of the impacts of changes in asset prices and the overall monetary policy stance. <\/p>  <p>  At its latest meeting in January 2018, the European Central Bank (ECB) made no change to its decision to reduce the scale of its quantitative easing (QE) purchases, whilst also leaving open the possibility of an extension beyond the expected end date of September 2018.  This response balances favourable short-run economic data flow and a generally positive outlook against possible market disruption that may occur in the event of an abrupt wind-down.  Its previous decision to downsize the rate of monthly purchases was based on a view that the euro area economy no longer needs the same level of monetary stimulus, a view that is supported by recent outturns in the euro area which showed a solid growth rate of 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter in Q4 2017, or 2.7 percent year-on-year.<\/p>  <p>  The United States Federal Reserve began unwinding its quantitative easing assets from its balance sheet in October 2017.  Similar to the ECB, this decision was based on the assessment that the US economy had strengthened enough to no longer require this additional stimulus.  The impact of the gradual unwinding, which has been well communicated to markets, is thus also expected to have a limited impact, though some degree of market volatility related to the inflation outlook has been observed of late.<\/p>  <p>  The Financial Stability Group, comprising senior management of the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the NTMA, acts as the primary vehicle for senior management in the constituent institutions to assess and manage the key risks to financial stability.  One of the risks discussed in 2017 was the effects on financial stability of higher interest rates due to the unwinding of QE and by extension the potential effect on asset prices.  The Group's view that any negative impacts of winding down the QE programme are expected to be limited, assuming the process remains orderly.<\/p>  <p>  My Department monitors changes in the global economy, as well as stability risks to the Irish economy.  However, we cannot control the international environment, and the extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy adopted by the ECB, with the associated decline in sovereign borrowing costs, cannot last indefinitely. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department published an analysis with Budget 2018 (last October) of the impact of the ECB increasing its policy rates.  These simulations show that a one percentage point rise in policy interest rates by the ECB would result in Irish output being one percent lower, and employment being 0.7 percent lower, after 5 years, relative to a baseline projection.  The debt to GDP ratio is projected to rise by 2.3 percentage points after 5 years. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has consistently noted the potential for a reversal in risk premia related to any faster-than-expected normalisation in monetary policy as a source of risk in the macro-financial environment (see for example, Macro-Financial Review 2017:II).\u00a0 This scenario has in the past, and will again during 2018, feature in the regular stress testing exercises carried out for Irish and European banks as part of the European Banking Authority EU-wide stress testing exercises.  The relative indebtedness of Irish households and firms is also regularly analysed and commented on by the Central Bank, especially the sensitivity of debt servicing burdens given shocks to interest rates.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank also occasionally publishes research in the Quarterly Bulletin that reviews developments in the Eurosystem&rsquo;s monetary operations and impact on money markets, in addition to broader market developments where global central bank monetary policies may have an impact.<\/p>  <p>  The NTMA has been contemplating the end of the ECB&rsquo;s QE programme since its commencement in March 2015.  Through taking pre-emptive action over the past three years, it has significantly improved our debt redemption profile and lowered our debt interest bill.  At end-November 2014 the amount of Government bond and EU-IMF Programme related debt that was scheduled to mature over the three year period 2018 &ndash; 2020 was some &euro;60 billion.  Through the early repayment of IMF and Swedish and Danish bilateral loans, together with the early buyback and switching of near-term maturing bonds for longer maturity bonds, that figure has been reduced to circa &euro;44 billion currently. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, reflecting the NTMA strategy of pre-funding, Exchequer cash balances were over &euro;17 billion at the end of January.  This means that this year&rsquo;s &euro;8.8 billion bond maturity in October has effectively already been funded.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  These actions offer significant insurance against the possibility of rising interest rates in the coming years.  They have also had a very positive impact on the cost of servicing our national debt.  The interest bill, which was as high as &euro;7.5 billion as recently as 2014, fell to just under &euro;6.1 billion last year.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is crucially important that we prepare our economy for any challenges ahead, including a potential shift in global asset values, and continue careful management of the public finances.  I would point out that while our debt-to-GDP ratio will continue falling in the coming years (on the basis of my Department's forecasts), this is solely due to rising GDP; in purely money terms, we will continue to increase public debt this year and in 2019. In these circumstances, prudent budgetary policies must be implemented in order to minimise debt interest payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800056#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[6664\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800056#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the impact of increasing oil prices on the economy; the mechanisms in place to tackle inflation while interest rates remain low; the risks to the economy and to competitiveness of increased inflation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>In general, as an energy importer Ireland has benefitted from the steep fall in oil prices since 2014.  While oil prices have picked up over the past couple of years and particularly in recent months, they remain well below their recent peak. Further, futures markets suggest that oil prices will remain subdued.  However, if there was a rapid rebound in oil prices then it could pose a risk to the economy&rsquo;s growth prospects.  For example, higher oil prices would reduce consumer spending power and lower corporate profitability. <\/p>  <p>  The pick-up in oil prices last year contributed positively to consumer price inflation.  For example, the annual rate of inflation for the energy component of the Harmonised index of Consumer Prices (HICP) averaged 4 per cent last year.  Despite this, overall HICP inflation averaged just 0.3 per cent last year, the fifth consecutive year of inflation below 1 per cent.<\/p>  <p>  By contrast, inflation in the euro area as a whole, on a HICP basis, averaged 1.5 per cent last year.  As a result, low inflation in Ireland has been contributing positively to Irish competitiveness.  As part of Budget 2018, the Department of Finance forecast a moderate pick-up in HICP inflation to 0.8 per cent this year.  While this forecast incorporated a lower assumed price of oil than currently prevailing, increased oil prices will impact inflation across all countries.  As a result, inflation in Ireland is expected to remain below the euro area average and thus inflation developments should again contribute positively to Irish competitiveness this year.  Inflation is therefore not considered a short-term risk at present. In fact, the challenge for the European Central Bank (ECB) in recent years has been that inflation in the euro area remains below its target.  This is why the ECB has maintained a policy of low interest rates in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  However, headline inflation developments are not the only factor contributing to competitiveness.  We must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements can reverse, as can be seen for example in the strengthening of the euro against the dollar.  In addition, excessive rent and house price growth are also a potential threat to competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  These factors have the potential to unwind some of the significant improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness in recent years.  For example, the latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland, show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe) has improved by 20 per cent between its peak in 2008 and December 2017. <\/p>  <p>  These risks highlight the importance of managing the public finances in a prudent manner and maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies so that the Irish economy is in the best possible position to weather any shocks that may emerge. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800056#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Data","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800056#WRF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[6892\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800056#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of freedom of information requests received by his Department in each of the years 2013 to 2017; the average time taken in these years to complete the requests by his Department; the number of requests to his Department for these years that ran beyond the deadline for the request; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>I have set out below in the following table the number of requests received in each year, those closed within the time limits and those closed outside the original\u00a0time limits:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Total incoming<\/th><th>Closed within time limit<\/th><th>Closed outside original \u00a0limit<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>220<\/td><td>126<\/td><td>94<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>166<\/td><td>106<\/td><td>60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>413<\/td><td>239<\/td><td>174<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>405<\/td><td>294<\/td><td>111<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>406<\/td><td>286<\/td><td>100<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>20 Freedom of Information requests from 2017 remain live. <\/p><p>Requests\u00a0may be\u00a0closed outside the original time limits in a variety of circumstances, including\u00a0-<\/p><p>- a deposit\u00a0being sought,<\/p><p>- clarification\u00a0being sought from the requester,<\/p><p>- where 3rd party consultation is required; <\/p><p>- where an appeal is made in respect of a proposed fee;<\/p><p>- where an extended timeframe is agreed between the requester and the decision maker.<\/p><p>The time spent in responding to freedom of information requests is not specifically monitored, other than in relation to estimated and actual search and retrieval time where a deposit is sought and obtained from a requester.

At present, there are over 120 persons active in IGEES roles (half recruited through IGEES recruitment stream and half from existing Departmental resources).  In terms of the IGEES recruitment, the average annual intake for the period 2012-2017 was just below 20.\u00a0 IGEES is currently concluding a round of graduate recruitment and in the middle of a round of middle management recruitment so numbers are expected to increase in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of those currently active in IGEES roles are economists by profession.

The policy informing QQI's application of fees was subject to extensive consultation and provides that fees will be comprehensive, coherent and reflect the amount and complexity of the work undertaken by QQI.  Fees had always been applied to providers in the higher education and training sector and QQI introduced fees for providers in the further education and training sector, thereby applying its policies equitably. <\/p>  <p>  In 2013 QQI published its policy for re-engagement with all education and training providers that had a quality assurance agreement with a predecessor agency.  Accreditation, including that provided by some of the predecessor agencies, is, by its nature, time-limited and subject to renewal. It is not a permanent status attributed to a provider.<\/p>  <p>  Re-engagement with such 'legacy' providers involves agreeing revised quality assurance procedures in accordance with specified requirements set down in the 2012 Act and in QQI policy. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding providers in the Community and Voluntary Sector specifically, it was agreed at a meeting hosted by my Department in December 2014 that there would be a lead-in time for the re-engagement process and that the issue of fees for community and voluntary providers would not arise until 2016 . This period was subsequently extended which has permitted QQI to hold more extensive engagements with providers from this Sector.<\/p>  <p>  Over the period in question, QQI established a Joint QQI\/Community and Voluntary Working Group involving\u00a0an independent facilitator with extensive experience in the community and voluntary sector.  This working group focused on a range of operational, developmental and strategic matters in the specific context of quality assurance and re-engagement which has informed both QQI and providers of the scope and nature of the requirements necessary for re-engagement.  To test these operational requirements, QQI is currently conducting a pilot exercise including providers from the community and voluntary sector which is expected to conclude in the coming months.  Further to these initiatives, QQI\u00a0also held a series of regional briefings over the course of 2017 for stakeholders to ensure that they are fully informed and prepared for re-engagement. <\/p>  <p>  The final level\u00a0of fee to be applied to legacy providers seeking to re-engage with QQI has yet to be determined and is currently the subject of deliberation between QQI and my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800056#WRF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts in Education Charter","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800056#WRF03800"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[6507\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800056#WRF03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason he has not sought to fill the vacant post of chairperson of the high level implementation group of the 2013 Arts in Education Charter.","asker":"1235","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":353,"content":"<p>The Arts in Education Charter, launched in 2013, is a joint initiative of the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht working in association with the Arts Council to promote arts-in-education.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The appointment of a chair to the Arts and Education Charter High Level Implementation group is a joint decision between myself and the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

From 2015, GYDPs have been co-funded under the Programme for Employability Inclusion and Learning of the European Social Fund (ESF) 2014-2020.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the funding and oversight of GYDPs is kept under ongoing review, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in the light of experience of operating the projects and with a view to the future development and direction of GYDP services.  In this context, and also to fully comply with ESF and other funding requirements, it is intended that a national Call for Proposals for the provision of these services (from 2019) will be issued by the IYJS in the first half of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800057#WRG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800057#WRG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":386,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[6475\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800057#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of a stamp 4 application in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":387,"content":"<p>I would refer the Deputy to my response to his Parliamentary Question No. 582 on 11 September 2017.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Stations of Swords, Balbriggan, Malahide and Lusk are all located in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the D.M.R. North Division on 31 December 2017 was 670 with 45 Garda Reserves and 39 Garda civilian staff also attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister Stanton outlined earlier today in the D&aacute;il, the Garda College in Templemore was closed in 2010.  It was closed by the then Government because of the severe and catastrophic economic crisis that the country was plunged into.  The closure of the College and the moratorium imposed at that time has obviously had an impact on numbers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When the last Government came into office, the initial focus was on stabilising the public finances and then returning the country to growth.  Once that had been achieved, one of the Government&rsquo;s first actions was to re-open the Garda College in Templemore.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 123 have been assigned to the D.M.R. North Division with 15 and 23 assigned to Swords and Balbriggan Garda stations respectively.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the D.M.R. North Division. <\/p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  I am informed that Lusk and Malahide Garda Stations are not training stations therefore new probationer Garda&iacute; are not allocated to either station.  However, it is important to note that the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Deputy had an opportunity to discuss these issues with Minister of State Stanton earlier this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800057#WRG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Service","counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800057#WRG03500"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[6552\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800057#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 545 of 16 January 2018, the legal and procedural issues that were considered incomplete in a report (details supplied); and the steps that can now be taken to conclude the issue for all parties involved in the investigation.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":408,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that in June 2010, the then Director General commissioned an external operational report into the circumstances surrounding the removal of a person from the D&oacute;chas Centre.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the operational report by the current Director General highlighted some legal and procedural flaws in the manner in which the enquiry was conducted.

These legal provisions strengthen the ability of Garda&iacute; to tackle drug driving. <\/p><p>I am advised by Garda authorities that a total of 52,395 MIT checkpoints were conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the legislation was commenced in April 2017 to the end of December 2017, during which 612 oral fluid tests were administered. <\/p><p>I am also advised by the Garda authorities that the following represents the number of positive roadside drug tests conducted each month since the commencement of the legislation on 13 April 2017 to 31 December 2017:<table><tr><th>Month<\/th><th>Positive Test Nos.<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>April<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>May<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>June<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>July<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>November<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>December<\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>90<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Of those 90 positive tests, I am informed that 89 persons were arrested, with one person having tested positive passing the subsequent impairment test.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the statistics provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provisional, operational and subject to change and are valid as of 1 February 2018. <\/p><p>The oral-fluid test is one of the options available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of the detection of intoxicated driving offences. Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may perform a roadside breath test to test for the presence of alcohol prior to making a decision to perform an oral fluid test. Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may also form the opinion that a driver is under the influence of an intoxicant from their observation of the person&rsquo;s driving or the behaviour and appearance of the person when stopped. <\/p><p>In addition, the power to conduct an impairment test is provided under Section 11 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, as amended, which permit members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to require a driver to perform a number of tests in order for the member to establish if the driver is committing an offence. These provisions were further extended by the Road Traffic Act 2016, which permits members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to perform an impairment test following arrest in respect of certain road traffic offences.<\/p><p>The addition of the drug driving provisions to the extensive range of powers provided by the Road Traffic Acts as a whole enable Garda&iacute; to further reduce the number of fatal and serious injury collisions on our roads and to prevent, apprehend and prosecute offenders. <\/p><p>Last year witnessed the lowest number of annual road traffic fatalities on record (159).  Every death on our roads is a horrific tragedy and I am also very conscious of those injured on our roads.  It is therefore imperative that the positive momentum across road traffic enforcement and road safety initiatives is harnessed towards further annual reductions in fatalities for the remainder of the life of the Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020. <\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na benefitted from considerable resource investment by this Government in 2017, which has contributed to the most welcome downward trend in road traffic fatalities. <\/p><p>The recruitment of an additional 150 Garda&iacute; to Roads Policing Units this year will contribute to a stronger road traffic enforcement capability nationwide. <\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also intends to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore and this will have a positive impact on enforcement and, as a result, safety on our roads. <\/p><p>Ireland has over a number of years developed a multi-agency approach to road safety through the involvement of a number of agencies working in partnership, under the aegis of the Road Safety Strategy.  Progress in relation to the actions and outcomes set out in the Strategy are monitored on an ongoing basis by the Road Safety Authority and the other agencies involved, and overseen by a Ministerial Committee on Road Safety, which I attend. <\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021) sets out key strategic objectives for Road Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Road Policing plans over the lifetime of the Programme.

These provisions have been further extended by the Road Traffic Act 2016, which permits members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to perform an impairment test following arrest in respect of certain road traffic offences.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Kildare Division on 31 December 2017 was 360, an increase of 48 since 31 December 2015, with 20 Garda Reserves and 30 Garda civilian staff also attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years in addition to the 2,800 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the re-opening of the Garda College in September 2014. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 80 have been assigned to the Kildare Division.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, funding has also been provided for a further 500 civilians to be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Kildare Division in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800058#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Data","counter":459,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800058#WRH03200"},{"type":"question","counter":460,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[6896\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800058#WRH03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of freedom of information requests received by his Department in each of the years 2013 to 2017; the average time taken in these years to complete the requests by his Department; the number of requests to his Department for these years that ran beyond the deadline for the request`; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":461,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Number of Requests<\/th><th>Number of decisions issued<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>550<\/td><td>573<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>920<\/td><td>864<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>941<\/td><td>950<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>583<\/td><td>591<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>796<\/td><td>780<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The number of decisions issued per annum includes a carryover of live cases from the previous year.<\/p><p>Dealing with Freedom of Information requests is part of the daily work of staff across my Department so the time spent processing requests is not recorded separately.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications.  GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system.  The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.<\/p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .<\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

Attendance at these meetings ensures my Department is up-to-date with both progress and challenges encountered by other EU countries that are seeking to progress electronic health records and digital health initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  We must be aware of the lessons learnt from other jurisdictions when developing our own solution for Ireland.  Experience from other countries demonstrates that the vendor markets supplying many of these services needs to be carefully managed in terms of capacity and capability to deliver working tailored solutions in a satisfactory manner.  My Department is currently evaluating how this might be progressed particularly in delivering an Electronic Health Record in the context of the work being planned for the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  The scale of the task in implementing a national electronic health record programme is very large and requires a complex procurement and approval process.  It is a five to ten year programme of work depending on the scale of resources deployed.<\/p>  <p>  The National eHealth Strategy along with the development of the Individual Health Identifier, through the Health Identifier Act 2014 are critical elements in ensuring that patients are empowered and can access their own data.  The HSE are currently progressing with a health portal initiative which will provide patients access to their information and support patients by involving them in their own health care.  The health portal will act as a digital gateway for patients to gain access to health information and to deliver targeted patient centric data to the general public.  The initial focus of the health portal will be on maternity service users and will allow patients access to medical reports and upcoming appointments.  The range of services available will expand as the Electronic Health Record Programme progresses.<\/p>  <p>  Ensuring patient and professional access to the right information, at the right place, at the right time supports more effective decision-making on the part of clinicians and can also empower patients to be more informed and involved in their own care or treatment. However, there is a need to strike an appropriate balance between using and sharing personal health information appropriately while continuing to protect rights to privacy and confidentiality.  Patients must be assured at all times that their personal health information is handled legally, securely, efficiently and effectively in order to deliver the best possible care.<\/p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into effect in all member states in May, involves a single set of data protection and privacy rules and establishes a legal basis for the processing of personal data based on clear and uniform principles.  The GDPR will replace the current data protection rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data.  The current focus of my Departments activity is to ensure that the legislative arrangements necessary to support the appropriate information environment exists when the new EU General Data Protection Regulation comes into effect this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800061#WRL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services Provision","counter":633,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800061#WRL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[6633\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800061#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11 has had their general practitioner changed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":635,"content":"<p>As this question relates to a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800061#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Capital Programme","counter":636,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800061#WRL02600"},{"type":"question","counter":637,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[6641\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800061#WRL02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the necessary resources will be provided to allow for the commissioning of the purpose built maternity theatre at Letterkenny University Hospital; when the facility will open for procedures to be carried out; the reason the facility has been lying idle since its construction in 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":638,"content":"<p>In response to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800061#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Screening Programmes","counter":639,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800061#WRL02900"},{"type":"question","counter":640,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[6642\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800061#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the waiting times for breast check; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":641,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[6643\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800061#WRL03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will increase the frequency of breast check in all areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":642,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 239 together.<\/p><p>The latest published waiting time figures (2015\/16) for BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, are provided as follows:<table><tr><th>Screening Programme<\/th><th>%<\/th><th>Target<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Women re-invited for screening within 24 months of invitation at previous round<\/td><td>63.50%<\/td><td>\u226590%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Women re-invited for screening within 27 months of invitation at previous round<\/td><td>94.40%<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Women eligible for screening invited for screening within 2 years of becoming known to the programme<\/td><td>92.10%<\/td><td>\u226590%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The current approach of two yearly intervals is considered to be the safest and most effective approach for a population-based breast screening programme.

In relation to Ireland, the term &ldquo;carbon credits&rdquo; may relate to allowances issued under the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) or the EU Effort Sharing Decision.<\/p>  <p> The EU ETS is a cornerstone of the EU's policy to combat climate change and is a key mechanism for reducing greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively.  It covers emissions from power and heat generation, energy-intensive industry sectors including oil refineries, steel works and production of iron, aluminium, metals, cement, lime, glass, ceramics, pulp, paper, cardboard, acids, bulk organic chemicals and aviation.  The EU ETS includes some 11,000 installations with an installed capacity of more than 30MW, with 101 installations currently in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The ETS works on the 'cap and trade' principle.  A cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by installations covered by the system.  The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall.  Within the cap, companies receive or buy emission allowances, or carbon credits, which they can trade with one another as needed.  They can also buy limited amounts of international credits from emissions saving projects in third countries.  The limit on the total number of allowances available ensures that they have a value.  An ETS installation must surrender enough allowances annually to cover all its emissions, or face penalties.  If an installation reduces its emissions, it may retain excess allowances to cover its future needs or sell them to another installation that is short of allowances.<\/p>  <p>  The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020.  These targets cover sectors of the economy that fall outside the scope of the ETS, including transport, buildings, agriculture and waste management.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005.  Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency (April 2017) indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's ESD 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. <\/p>  <p>  The legislative framework governing the EU&rsquo;s 2020 emissions reductions targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States.  Using banked emissions from the period 2013 to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018.  However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances, or carbon credits.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of credits required.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the two EU legal frameworks described above, carbon credits are also traded under emissions trading frameworks implemented under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change primarily aimed at supporting emissions reductions in developing countries.  There are also a number of voluntary or private carbon credit schemes within which carbon credits are issued and traded by individuals or firms who may seek to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by a real and verifiable amount. Such schemes do not interact with the frameworks described above and I have no plans to introduce such a scheme in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800062#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategic Communications Unit","counter":676,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800062#WRM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":677,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[6534\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800062#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he, his officials or advisers have had meetings with the strategic communication unit since it was set up; the issues that were discussed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":678,"content":"<p>I met with\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Concannon and a colleague from the Strategic Communications Unit\u00a0on 5 October\u00a02017.

Accordingly, in Budget 2018, I obtained an increase in funding for services experiencing sustainability issues (to &euro;1.7M in total).  My officials are currently developing policy priorities in respect of this additional funding; which I hope will be of assistance to many services in the coming year.

I would encourage Churchill Community Childcare CLG to apply should they consider themselves eligible and in need of the specific strands of financial assistance available.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of wider sustainability efforts, I have secured funding to increase the revenue of childcare settings through their standard programme funding, and also ensured that the provision of &euro;18m in Programme Support Funding in 2017 will be replicated in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  I am also keenly aware of the pressures on the sector with regard to availability of places and sustainability and, following on from significant investment in 2016 and 2017, my Department is providing &euro;6.86m for its capital funding programme under Budget 2018.

An increase for a qualified adult (IQA) is payable in respect of a person who is wholly or mainly maintained by the claimant.  This can be the claimant&rsquo;s spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant or a person over 16 years of age who is caring for a qualified child of the claimant.   <\/p>  <p>  Not all people who work on a part-time or casual basis can be classified as a qualified adult on their spouse&rsquo;s social protection payment as this depends on the level of their income.  The spouse of the claimant is only regarded as being wholly or mainly maintained by the claimant where the weekly income of the spouse is less than &euro;100 per week.  If the spouse&rsquo;s income is less than &euro;100 per week a full rate increase for a qualified adult is payable. <\/p>  <p>  Where the qualified adult has earnings or income in excess of &euro;100 and up to &euro;310 gross per week a reduced rate is payable for a qualified adult in the case of state pension contributory.  A person in receipt of a state pension non-contributory may receive a reduced rate pension where their spouse is in employment or self-employment depending on the level of the spouse&rsquo;s earnings.<\/p>  <p>  In some cases where a person is entitled to an IQA on their payment, it may be that that the couple would be better off if the qualified adult made a claim in their own right.  For example, it may be more financially beneficial for a couple if each of them claimed their own state pension.   <\/p>  <p>  Where a person is employed, including on a casual or part-time basis, they will be liable to PRSI once their earnings are over &euro;38 per week in which case there won&rsquo;t be a gap in their social insurance record.  <\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for state pension purposes. This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult to assess whether periods of time spent as a qualified adult on a person&rsquo;s social protection payment will impact on their own pension entitlement.  This will depend upon a number of factors including: <\/p>  <p>  - their PRSI record, from the time they first entered into social insurance;<\/p>  <p>  - whether they qualify for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - the legislation in place when they reach state pension age; and<\/p>  <p>  - their future entitlements under means-tested pension options.<\/p>  <p>  The fact of being a qualified adult on their spouse&rsquo;s payment may or may not have any impact on a person&rsquo;s eligibility for a state pension, depending on the person&rsquo;s individual circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800063#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Administration","counter":737,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800063#WRN00500"},{"type":"question","counter":738,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[6484\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020800063#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if persons working and-or providing services in the community employment sector are eligible for grants and or funding if they are pursing a PhD level of education; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":739,"content":"<p>Training on Community Employment (CE) is based on the personal and occupational needs of each individual and is identified through the tailored Individual Learning Plan (ILP), agreed between the CE Supervisor and the participant and approved by my Department.

Through consideration of the report prepared by the Committee, coupled with the extensive debate in the D&aacute;il over nine hours to which many Deputies contributed, from all sides of the House, the spirit of the legislative arrangements set out in the Bill has been respected, and we have carefully listened and taken on board many of the issues raised. <\/p><p>In addition, there has been an extensive wider consultation process, including formal engagement with the elected members of Regional Assemblies and Local Authorities, and the wide range of views received are being considered in finalising the NPF. <\/p><p>Having devoted a huge amount of effort on engagement and integrating views from across all parties into the final document, the priority now is to finalise and adopt this Framework, and the complementary 10-year Capital Plan so that there is effective strategic planning and infrastructure investment to meet the pressing needs of a resurgent economy and wider society.  <\/p><p>A formal vote on the final NPF was never envisaged under the legislation, rather that both Houses would have a formal chance to input to the drafting process.
