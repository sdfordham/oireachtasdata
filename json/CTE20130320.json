This demand is linked to global population growth.  In 1999 global population levels passed 6 billion for the first time, last year they passed 7 billion and in 2025 they will pass 8 billion.  In conjunction with changes in dietary habits and increased demand from Asia, this has led to a rapid rate of increase in demand for seafood.  It is generally estimated that global capture fisheries have reached the maximum sustainable output of approximately 80 million tonnes per year.  Demand for seafood at a global level will, therefore, increasingly be met through aquaculture production.  The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations estimates that an additional 42 million tonnes of farmed seafood will be required annually by 2030.  Aquaculture is already producing almost 50% of the world's seafood.  In 2010 global aquaculture production reached 60 million tonnes, with an estimated value of was $119 billion.  This was an increase of nearly 8% on the previous year.  Production is estimated to have increased further to 64 million tonnes in 2011.<\/p><p>  European aquaculture production now stands at approximately 2.5 million tonnes per annum.  This accounts for around 4.2% of world aquaculture production.  Countries within the European Union produce approximately 1.2 million tonnes of aquaculture product.  In the European aquaculture context, salmon has been the main species to be developed.  Demand for salmon has been growing very well.  The current size of the farmed salmon market is approximately 2 million tonnes.  Demand in this regard is still developing.  In Europe, which is considered to be a mature market, demand for salmon has been growing by around 7% per annum for the past ten years.  The Russian market for salmon is growing at 27% per annum.  Close to 60% of world salmon production involves farmed salmon.  Much of this comes from Norway, Chile, the UK and North America.  It is estimated that the Atlantic salmon market will continue to grow by 4% per year in the period 2013 to 2020.<\/p><p>  Norway is now the world's largest producer of farmed Atlantic salmon, generating more than 1.2 million tonnes in 2011.  More than 838,000 tonnes of that, with a value of 29 billion krone, was exported.  Norway has been developing its industry since the early 1970s.  It was targeted as a means of restoring the livelihoods of rural fishing communities whose economies have become depressed on foot of a decline in wild fisheries.  Norway's initial production was less than 500 tonnes.  This was largely generated by small family businesses and sold to local markets.  In recent decades the industry has developed very rapidly and some vary large multinational companies are now operating in it.  Farmed fish has become Norway's fourth largest export commodity after oil, gas and metals.<\/p><p>  Within the EU, the UK produces farmed Atlantic salmon in significant quantities.  The vast bulk of this is generated in Scotland, which is the largest farmed Atlantic salmon producer in the EU and the third largest globally.  In 2011 Scotland produced 158,000 tonnes of farmed salmon, worth &pound;584 million.  Scotland did not begin farming salmon until the 1970s.  In 1971 it produced 14 tonnes of farmed salmon.  This had increased to 40,000 tonnes by 1991.  By 2001 it had increased again to 138,000 tonnes.  Farmed salmon is now Scotland's largest food export product.<\/p><p>  To set the context for any discussion we might have on aquaculture, we must compare the situation in Ireland with those which obtain in Norway and Scotland.  Ireland commenced salmon farming in 1974 and in 2012 we produced just 14,500 tonnes of farmed salmon.  The fact that Irish aquaculture production has not grown but has a substantial opportunity for growth was recognised in Food Harvest 2020, which the Government has adopted as its food strategy document.  Food Harvest 2020 identifies ways in which the seafood sector can increase turnover to &euro;1 billion and employment to 14,000 full-time equivalent jobs by 2020.  Food Harvest 2020 also calls on the aquaculture industry to play its part by expanding the volume of its production by 78%.  It seeks that the relevant State agencies, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute, should continue research and development work in the areas of offshore aquaculture and alternative species aquaculture.<\/p><p>  In the context of the Food Harvest 2020 recommendations, BIM has begun to consider new fish farming production areas in deeper waters.  This is a response to the fact that the Irish aquaculture industry has previously been constrained, in part because more than 80% of its operations are located in inshore areas governed by EU environmental directives, primarily the Natura directives.  The concept is that situating the larger aquaculture operations in deep waters would place them outside Natura areas, thus minimising impacts, simplifying licensing requirements and taking account of the necessary environmental limitations.  This has led to an examination of potential sites by BIM and the Marine Institute and also to a consideration of oceanographic and other data which indicate what sites might be most suitable for allowing Irish aquaculture to expand, given the opportunity.<\/p><p>  BIM estimates that one deep-sea salmon farm could potentially produce 15,000 tonnes of organic salmon, generate more than &euro;100 million in exports and create 500 direct and indirect jobs.  In view of growing international demand for salmon, it is perceived that there would be significant interest on the part of operators to run such a farm.  In addition, there would be scope for expansion.  I am seeking here to establish an economic context for any discussion we may have in respect of aquaculture.<\/p> <p>The aquaculture operating in a marine environment is subject to a variety of regulatory regimes which seek to ensure that it is operated properly, is located well and that its impact is minimised.  In recent years, a key feature of aquaculture regulation has been compliance with the EU birds and habitat directives.  Those directives apply to special areas of conservation, specially protected areas, the latter having particular relevance for birds.  Most aquaculture in Ireland is carried out within either special areas of conservation or specially protected areas.  In 2007, the European Court of Justice declared that by failing to take all measures necessary to comply with the EU habitats and birds directive in respect of the authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive.  This required a significant re-thinking of policy.  In negotiations with the Commission to address the judgment, the process was agreed with the European Commission on how to move forward to implement a licensing system in those specific areas which would be in compliance with the Natura and birds directive.<\/p><p> That process includes data collection in 91 bays and estuaries around the coast.  That data collection was a major exercise.  It would not be possible otherwise to move to a situation where decisions could be made in compliance with the habitats and birds directive.  The data collection covered both the seabed, the water column and migratory species, whether fish, sea mammals or birds.  It required the development of a time series of data to allow for judgments to be made, the analysis of that raw data and the setting of individual conservation objectives for each of those areas by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.<\/p><p>  Appropriate assessments had to be carried out on each licence application or fishery plan against the detailed conservation objectives which were then set on the basis of the data available to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The completion of the appropriate assessments can then lead to determinations on the licences and on the management of the fisheries on the basis of the appropriate assessment.<\/p><p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, has been working with the Marine Institute, BIM and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, to achieve compliance through a multi-annual work programme to build up that profile of data.  A key factor of that work programme is the identification of prioritised bays, based on the number of aquaculture sites, the availability of scientific data and other factors.  That work is ongoing and is a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State seeking to resolve the issue and to move to a situation where aquaculture decisions can be made in compliance with the habitats and birds directives and to allow the continuation and, where appropriate, the development, of the aquaculture industry in those locations.<\/p><p> A regularly arising issue is the backlog of licences which has built up over a period of time, largely due to the decision on the Natura compliance.  The low number of licences issued since 2007 is a result of that decision and the requirement to build up a complex system which is in compliance with the Natura directives.  Initiatives were taken during the period.  Last year, 115 licence determinations were made by the Minister for licence applications in non-Natura areas.  This year, the expectation is that this number will be exceeded and that for the first time it will include determinations in Natura areas.<\/p><p> The appropriate assessments have been completed at this stage in respect of Dundalk, Roaringwater Bay and Castlemaine in County Kerry.  In respect of Castlemaine, the public notice phase of the licensing process has concluded and the process of finalising licensing determinations is at an advanced stage.  That largely affects the mussel industry in Castlemaine.<\/p><p> BIM has submitted an application to the Department for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of fin fish near Inis Oirr in Galway Bay.  That application and its accompanying environmental impact assessment statement is being considered under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act and the 1933 Foreshore Act.  They provide for extensive consultation with stakeholders and also for a general period of public consultation.  The public consultation stage of the assessment process in respect of the application is now closed.  A total of 410 valid submissions were received by the Department.  As the application is under active consideration as part of a statutory process, it would not be appropriate to publish the submissions in advance of a determination in respect of the case.  All aspects of the Galway bay application are currently being examined by the Department in conjunction with its scientific, engineering, technical and legal advisers.  All submissions received as part of both the statutory consultation stage of the process and the general public consultation stage, will form an integral part of the Department's consideration of the application.  There is extensive consultation associated with that process. <\/p><p> It is also important to clarify that as the application is under active consideration as part of a statutory process, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the merits or otherwise of the application, pending the completion of the formal assessment process by the Department.  The application process is governed by legislation and must not be subject to parallel discussions which could be misconstrued as indicating any predisposition on the licensing authority in respect of the application.  It should also be noted that the legislation provides for possible appeal of any ministerial decision to the Aquaculture Licence Appeals Board, an independent authority for the determination of appeals against decisions of the Minister.<\/p><p> I refer to other deep water sites.  A site off Inisturk in County Mayo is also being examined by BIM for suitability as a deep sea site.  Other aquaculture licences which have been the subject of recent comment include an application received by the Department from Marine Harvest Ireland, a large aquaculture company operating in Ireland, for an aquaculture licence in respect of a proposed salmon farm at Shot Head in Bantry Bay.  That application is under consideration by the Department in accordance with the legislatory framework.  As that application is under consideration it would not be appropriate for the Department to comment.<\/p><p> Another issue which arises about discussion on fin fish aquaculture in particular is that of sea lice, a natural organism living in the marine environment which lives on approximately 40 different wild species of fish in the sea.  Sea lice are a permanent feature.  Control of the sea lice is an issue for aquaculture and it continues to be part of the overall regulatory process applying to aquaculture.  Control protocols are in place and these are operated by the Marine Institute on behalf of the State.  These include inspections of farms by the Marine Institute, a total of 14 inspections per year.  The results of those inspections are made public.  The inspection regime is independent.  When the inspection finds a sea lice level on a farm or site is above what is known as a trigger level, a mandatory treatment is ordered.  The protocols have been the subject of detailed investigation and testing by the EU Commission in response to a complaint from a member of the public in respect of the effects of sea lice on wild salmon.  In October 2012, the Commission closed its investigation of this complaint in the State's favour, following its examination of all relevant matters.  The Commission also indicated it regards the sea lice protocols operated in Ireland as representing the best international practice.  <\/p><p> During the period when licences have not issued during the data collection process on the bays covered by Natura, a parallel process was done to upgrade the licence instruments that would be applicable once the new system came into being.<\/p> <p>The new aquaculture licence scheme provides a much more comprehensive set of obligations and rights for licence holders to ensure that operations are fully compliant with all relevant obligations.<\/p><p> I shall outline the key features of the new licences.  There is a move to a standing stock biomass for fin fish as a means of measuring production capacity at an aquaculture site.  There are enhanced provisions on environmental monitoring.  There is greater clarity on the requirements for operators with regard to operational conduct and monitoring.  There is the possibility of group marking of sites for navigational purposes so that a significant number of operators can work in tandem in an area.  Specific provisions cover company registration, dissolution, tax certificates, payment of fees, etc.  The new licence templates are also specific to particular sites so are a more targeted instrument than previous ones.  The Department held a number of information seminars for industry when the new templates were introduced.<\/p><p> I hope I have put things in context for members regarding the overall global aquaculture sector, the demand for aquaculture products, international development of the industry and the regulatory regimes in place to develop aquaculture in Ireland.  The sector will play a much bigger part in seafood production in Ireland and globally and that is what the Department has seen in all countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013032000003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cecil Beamish","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363796400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Beamish for giving us the background of the socioeconomic situation.

Can Mr. Beamish explain what discretion or policy options are open to the Irish Government regarding the six and 12-mile limits that would make allowance for small inshore fishermen and fleets?  They traditionally fished in these waters but the ban will make them part-time fishermen.  Are there policy instruments available to a national Irish Government?

Having examined the Norwegian and Scottish experience, I can see there is great potential to develop an aquaculture industry on the western seaboard of Ireland.  If the licensing framework and appeals regime is robust, independent and seen to be independent then I have no doubt the sector will provide employment over the next decade to 15 years.  It would particularly provide employment in areas that IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland would not go into in a month or in decades.  We must embrace the sector and its potential.  However, we must adopt a sensitive approach.  I welcome the work that has been done on the sensitive SAC and Natura sites.  Many of these sites are contentious and controversy will inevitably follow many of the proposals, whether they are from BIM or private industry.  Much inadequate information and misinformation has been circulated.  There is also a lot of genuine concern about the sites.  For example, there is a concern that traditional jobs and fisheries will be displaced, and we should not ignore such concerns.  When one is balancing books and saying that a provision will create X jobs, one must subtract the jobs that will be displaced, such as those in sea fisheries.  We should avoid that at all costs.<\/p><p>  Deputy Pringle mentioned the exercise on the 94 bays and harbours that are Natura sites.  Has that work been completed?  Roaring Water Bay, Dundalk Bay and Castlemaine Bay were mentioned.  Are they the only bays being considered for licensing applications at present?    <\/p><p>  The committee does not just focus on aquaculture.  We have a concern, which was touched on during our previous meeting, that some rural communities have suffered as a result of consolidation in the sea-fishing industry.  Can we explore the possibility of aquaculture being complementary to sea fishing?  Can we allocate a total allowable catch, TAC, improve licensing or create more favourable policy instruments to support island and remote rural communities that do not have access to fishery harbour centres on the west coast?  Can we explore how such communities can exploit resources on their doorstep to provide jobs, not just in the aquaculture sector but in the small inshore fleet?  I know that much of this subject requires a national discussion and a national policy.  Some of the challenges that lie ahead are the allocation of TAC from one sector to another and the controversies that could follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013032000005#D00500","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363796400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I shall first clarify the points made by Deputies Pringle and Harrington.  I sought to convey the position on the Natura sites and perhaps I did not convey it fully.  The process is long and detailed and one can only reach the endpoint if one has built all of the previous steps along the way.  The task was set to gather information on the pelagic environment, living marine organisms, migrating sea mammals and fish species, the tidal environment and migrating birds.<\/p> <p>Data has had to be collected across 91 bays and estuaries.  A one-year dataset on migrating birds, for example, is not adequate for an environmental decision.  One must build a time series.  Simply gathering information one year does not get one there.  The process has frustrated everybody involved.  It is very complicated and slower than anybody wants but it is what is required.<\/p><p> A significant part of the process has been a huge data collection exercise across bays and estuaries.  A bay may be 30 miles long and 20 miles wide.  It may be an even larger area of water.  The focus in the first number of years has largely been on data collection.  Analysis of the data has been carried out by the agencies of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, particularly the Marine Institute.  BIM has also worked on the data in relation to fisheries matters.  The data as analysed is provided to the National Parks and Wildlife Service to allow it to decide what the conservation objectives will be for a particular area.  Without knowing the conservation objectives, there is no target by reference to which one can judge the potential damage of any proposals to which consent is sought.  Creating the information and analysing it as required to set the detailed conservation objectives of designated areas has been the second stage of the process.<\/p><p> Once conservation objectives are set, the appropriate assessments can be made of every licence application and fisheries plan proposed.  At this point, appropriate assessments, which run to hundreds of pages and include detailed technical argument, have been finalised in relation to three bays.  It is not that we have got to the end point in relation to the 91 bays, but we have started down the road.  Other assessments are at various stages of being worked up.  The final step is to make decisions on the basis of the appropriate assessments which come out at the end of the process.  The Cromane-Castlemaine mussel fisheries are the first that will come out of the process.  They are almost there in terms of a decision.  The objective, clearly, is to work through all the other bays.  It goes back and forwards a bit.  One gets the data and when it has been reviewed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service it may transpire that all the data required to make a decision has not been obtained.  Further specific data collection on a particular species may be required.  It is an iterative process and is a very major undertaking.<\/p><p> At the conclusion of the process, we will have built up a dataset on all major inshore waters which are seafood producing.  The dataset will be equally applicable to any other activity proposed in a bay.  It does not just have a benefit for fisheries and aquaculture.  Any other development, including a pipeline, wind farm or marina, can be appropriately assessed by reference to the dataset to ensure compliance with habitats protection.  That should allow decisions on development to be taken much more quickly.  The ammunition will be there.  The data has a wider application than just to our work on fisheries and aquaculture but it must be done in this context.  It also means that when we get there, we can consider new proposals which arise for developments over and above what is currently in place.  While all of this process been going on, the position has been that aquaculture activities have continued at the same level where they already exist.  They have not ceased.  That people have not been stopped from continuing their activities has been an important element of the process.<\/p><p> There is a huge variety of inshore fishing activity in Ireland.  While it is technically the case that the Common Fisheries Policy governs all living marine organisms from the shore to a point 200 miles out at sea, management measures have not been developed for many species.  Only a certain number of species are subject to quotas, tax and other limitations.  For many inshore species, few if any Common Fisheries Policy positions exist.  There are provisions to govern the registration of fleet vessels but there are few at species level other than provisions on minimum sizes and other technical provisions.  We have many inshore fisheries which are not heavily impacted by the Common Fisheries Policy and it is very much open to debate as to whether that is a good or bad thing.  It is a question of whether they should be subject to further management.  Decisions in that context are dependent on the availability of information, the ability to manage and the ability to enforce.  We could go through a whole raft of inshore fisheries ranging from lobster and crab fisheries to whelks and crawfish.  There is a huge multiplicity of things that can be done and that fishermen are still able to do.  The specific situation in relation to area 6 is a result of poor white-fish stocks there and the need to rebuild them.  Poor stocks for many years led to the introduction of a so-called &quot;cod recovery plan&quot; which then led to a series of other restrictions on activity.  There is a great deal of detail as to how the situation in area 6 has evolved which can be provided.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin Ferris referred to the issue of sea lice.  I have not read the specific article he mentioned but sea lice are endemic.  They are part of the marine environment and hosted by many wild species.  The issue with fin fish farming is the extent to which concentrations of sea lice build up and are managed.  They cannot be eliminated as they are endemic in the environment.  It is a question of managing levels.  A great deal of work has been done in Ireland over the years to develop a stringent, independent and transparent system to manage sea lice on finfish farms.  It is a very open system and the results are available to everybody including on the Internet.  Farms are independently inspected and the consequences of inspections are clearly set out in the relevant protocols.  The protocols are procedures attached to the licences for farms and are legally enforceable.  In the event that treatment does not reduce sea lice levels, there is a racheting up of the actions which must be taken up to the point that the stock can be removed.  It is a stronger and more transparent system than we see in other major salmon producing countries.  In terms of the impact of sea lice, there has been a long and energetic debate between the angling and aquaculture community on the impact of salmon farms on wild stocks.  The Department takes its advice from the Marine Institute which is our scientific adviser and has expertise built up over many years.  Its most recent report is a paper published in March 2013 in the <i>Journal of Fish Diseases<\/i>.  The paper is the result of a nine year study on 350,000 migrating salmon and is comprehensive.<\/p> <p>Effectively, they inoculated one population of migrating salmon against sea lice and did not inoculate another population, and then measured the returning fish in both cases.  There was a 94% or 95% rate of mortality at sea beyond the range of the sea lice, depending on whether the fish had been inoculated.  It added 1% to the mortality rate.<\/p><p> To some extent, the target of the debate is often missed.  Both salmon farmers and anglers need sea lice to be controlled.  Not tightly controlling them in is in the interest of neither party.  Farmed salmon do not thrive if there is a build-up of sea lice.  Whatever one's view on the extent to which the risk to wild salmon exists, it must increase if the concentrations of sea lice increase.  It is in the interest of both parties that sea lice are controlled.  The regulatory system in place is designed to control the level of sea lice for that purpose in the interests of all parties.  They both have the same objective.  Neither party can eliminate sea lice, which are an endemic part of the environment.  It is a lively debate that will always be there as long as fish aquaculture exists.  It is simply a debate about how to effect controls.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013032000005#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cecil Beamish","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363797600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Mr. Beamish said that in one case there was a 1% difference in the number that returned.

I am interested in why the Department seems to be going for this huge \"big bang\" approach under the aegis of BIM, which is obviously subject to ministerial policy direction.<\/p> <p>That ministerial policy direction seems to be as follows: first, the ownership is not local; second, if anything goes wrong it is a big failure; third, environmental risks are huge from day one; and fourth, it is very unlikely to get general local acceptance.  This is as opposed to trying to get those who have done this at a sustainable level on a small scale to grow as their knowledge and capacity grows with the ownership staying local.  The basic nature of inshore fishermen is to work on their own rather than be employees of a big multinational, which can at the turn of a switch decide the game is over and all that is left behind is the waste.<\/p><p> What informs the Department's approach on a policy level given that we are trying to develop sustainable rural communities where as many aspects of people's lives as possible are controlled from within the community?  I am very proud of the local timber mill in my area.  One of the great advantages it has had from the outset is that the general manager and minority shareholder is a Galway person and the majority shareholder is Connacht Gold.  That has created a great rock of connection to the place and we know it will stick with it through hell and high water, whereas if a multinational company owned it, the mill would be the first place to close if it ran into any difficulty.  I am wondering about the policy approach of the Department reflected by BIM actions.<\/p><p> Inshore fishermen perennially complain that where there is considerable fish farming, certain species of fish that are basically scavengers, will scavenge all the food that falls to the bottom of the sea.  They then become very fat, soft and mushy, but are inedible.  I do not know if the scientists dismiss this, but the fishermen swear it is so.  I will need to go out with the fishermen someday to find out whether they are feeding me a lot of foolish talk, but it is certainly local perception among dedicated inshore fishermen as opposed to anglers.  If there are 15,000 tonnes of fish a year and even allowing for the fantastic conversion rates they were saying they were getting, it would be strange that only 20% of that goes to the bottom of the seabed, which is still 3,000 tonnes of feed.  All of that must get consumed - that is the nature of it.  We all know if animal feed is left out the rats will come out of nowhere fast enough.  If we are doing a development that is for inshore fishermen I am concerned that they themselves complain it interferes with their very basic livelihood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013032000007#FF01500","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363798200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>The way we approached this in committee was conscious that there are things that can be talked about and things that cannot be talked about.

All of that is equally covered by the context that was established for aquaculture.  There are specific markets and specific site issues affecting each of those types of aquaculture developments.  In many ways aquaculture is only in its infancy.  The committee deals with agriculture, which has been around for 3,000 or 5,000 years.  It has been refined and developed with different species etc.  Aquaculture is essentially a 30 or 40-year old global venture now producing some 60 million tonnes a year.  It is only in its infancy in terms of where it is likely to go in order to meet the food demands.  Debates on aquaculture often become focused on one species or one application.<\/p> <p>There is a multiplicity of things going on around the coast and across Europe.  Aquaculture for other species may become dominant.  The largest part of feed production in the Mediterranean is sea bream and three or four related species that have developed there over the past 20 years.  They are different from the species we have.  There is ongoing research into other species.  The Deputy is probably familiar with the work on farming cod in Connemara.  That work showed that Ireland could produce very fast-growing farmed cod.  The problem there is that the rapid expansion of the cod stocks of Norway, which are much larger than anything we have, has kept down the price in the markets at levels that make it uneconomic to develop farmed cod.  Biologically it has been proved that the species can be farmed.  This is an evolving situation and it is diverse.

The Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, is the overarching policy framework governing fisheries and the wider seafood sector in the European Union.  The policy was first put in place in 1983 after some agreement on principles in the mid-1970s.  Important elements of the reform process, which occurs every ten years, are expected to be concluded during the Irish EU Presidency.<\/p><p>  The reform on this occasion is different to others in that it is the first one to take place under the provisions of the Lisbon treaty.  In previous reforms, the Commission proposed the reforms, there was consultation and dialogue, the Council considered it and then decided on it.  Under the Lisbon treaty arrangements, the Commission makes its proposal and then both the European Parliament and the Council take positions on it.  When those positions are cleared and settled, the negotiations begin between the Parliament and the Council in the co-decision process to arrive at a new reform.  This is one of the first times the co-decision process has been used on a complex EU policy area, so it is very much uncharted territory.<\/p><p>  The process was commenced in 2009 by the then European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Mr. Joe Borg, when he published a Green Paper on reforms of the policy.  In it he suggested significant changes to the way the policy operated by moving to a system based on fishing effort while changing the current parameters which govern the policy.  In Ireland, the then Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with special responsibility for fisheries and forestry, Tony Killeen, appointed Dr. Noel Cawley to head the consultation process with the fishing industry and other stakeholders.  They generated a response document to the Green Paper which was published in 2010 and set out Ireland's position on the review.  Many other member states engaged in a similar exercise.<\/p><p>  Following this consultation exercise, the Commission changed direction and brought forward new proposals which moved away from the proposal to base everything on fishing effort to one now based on transferable fishing concessions or individual transferable quotas and a market-based system which privatised fish quotas.  Since this was announced, it has undergone consideration and substantial change.<\/p><p>  CFP reform deals with three policy regulations.  First, there is the basic policy regulation which sets out the framework, general principles and structure of the reform.  There is a regulation on the common organisation of the market.  Both these regulations are underpinned by a separate financial instrument, the European maritime and fisheries fund.<\/p><p>  The main potential benefit of the policy system for Irish fishermen is that it provides a system which aspires to the structured and sustainable management of international fishing activity in each of the key areas of interest to them.  Fishing in Ireland has been an international activity for many years, involving our and many other fleets.  In addition, the CFP provides stable arrangements for access to the large and most valuable seafood market in the world, the EU's.  Exports to this market account for over 80% of Irish seafood products.  Ireland's overarching goal for the new CFP is for a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver sustainable fisheries for future generations.<\/p><p>  The most recent development on CFP reform was at the last fisheries Council meeting in February.  At that meeting, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, as President of the Council, was successful in brokering a political agreement for the introduction of an EU-wide discards ban and reaching a Common Position on the overall structure of the CFP framework regulation.  The outcome was 26 member states voted in favour of the package while one voted against.  All the major fishing nations supported the package.  In the tradition of fisheries negotiations, it finished at 6.30 a.m., so it was consistent in that respect.<\/p> <p>The Common Fisheries Policy in the February Fisheries Council and the CAP result last evening are at the same point in the process.  In terms of the CAP result last night, the Council arrived at a common position on the proposal.  In February, the Council arrived at a common position in regard to the CFP.  <\/p><p> That historic decision in February was of critical importance to the future of fisheries and, aligned to earlier decisions taken by the Council on a wide range of conservation measures, was an expression of the collective will of the Council in terms of the reform.  One of the headline elements of the reform was the ending of the current discard practices in European fisheries and promoting a new regime of sustainable fishing practices in the European fishing fleet.  <\/p><p> February's decision in reaching a Council general approach on all aspects of a reformed basic policy regulation was also important in that it allowed the Irish Presidency, on behalf of the Council, to engage directly with the European Parliament and Commission with a view to reaching an overall political agreement on the reform Common Fisheries Policy during the Irish Presidency.  In advance of the Irish Presidency, the Minister set out the ambition to try to bring the Common Fisheries Policy discussion on the core elements to a political agreement during the  Irish Presidency.  As I said, the process has been going on since 2009.<\/p><p> In the January Council, the Minister set out a work programme for each of the Council's and each of the months of the Irish Presidency intended to deliver, if possible, political agreement by June.  The Council unanimously supported that work programme and that enabled the Irish Presidency to come forward in February with the proposal for the general approach.  The agreement on that has now enabled the negotiations to commence with the European Parliament.<\/p><p> While the Council has a clear position, the February agreement is simply the Council's position.  The European Parliament also arrived at its position in early February and that position differs from the Council's in many respects.  Some of the differences are minor and there is a reasonable possibility of getting political compromise on those.  However, some of the other differences are significant.  <\/p><p> In general, the Council is looking for a more demanding approach in terms of some of the key issues, such as the discard ban and achieving maximum sustainable yield in fish stocks.  Achieving a political agreement between the Council and the European Parliament on those core issues remains a very significant challenge.<\/p><p> Turning to the decision taken in February on the discards ban, which is probably the most high profile element of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy, the Council has decided for practical reasons to support a phased application of a ban across fisheries in European waters.  In terms of the Irish position, leading into that, Ireland published a discard atlas two years ago to show the scale and complexity of the problem associated with discards.  That discard atlas was intended to get people to focus on what was involved in reaching a decision on discards.  There has been significant discussion with industry and between member states on how, in practical terms, a discard ban could be agreed.  That discussion led to the decision of the February Council.  <\/p><p> The discard ban the Council proposes would be phased in across European fisheries starting in January 2014 with pelagic fisheries.  That will impact on the Irish fishing fleet targeting small pelagic species, such as mackerel, herring, horse mackerel, blue whiting and boarfish, in addition to those targeting tuna.  While any discard ban will be challenging, it should be less so in the case of the pelagic fisheries where one has targeted and clean fisheries.  Given that Ireland has its most substantial quotas in pelagic fisheries and, therefore, is a big stakeholder in regard to some of those stocks, it is in our interest that discards be eliminated from pelagic fisheries as soon as possible.  <\/p><p> In January 2015, the ban will be introduced in the Baltic Sea but that will have no direct impact on Irish fisheries.  January 2016 will see the ban rolled out in the North Sea and south western waters and for the Irish fleet, it will apply to cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, prawns, common sole, plaice and hake.  Other fisheries for species subject to catch limits will also be subject to a ban from 2016.  The ban that will come in, in terms of the white fish fisheries which will start in 2016, will apply to the main species that define the fishery.  For lesser species, it will have to be applied to all the species by 2018 and from January 2017 and not later than January 2019 for all other species in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, all Union waters and in non-Union waters not subject to third country sovereignty or jurisdiction.  Effectively, by 2019, if the reform is implemented in the way the Council foresees it, then there will be a discard ban in place for all species subject to catch limits or in the Mediterranean subject to minimum size by 2019.  That will be a significant change from practice heretofore.<\/p><p> The discarding issue has always been contentious and resolving it will be difficult given the divergent views on the associated management tools needed to make a discard ban a reality in practice.  Resolving this issue is a major step in securing the long-term sustainability of stocks in European waters.  The timeframe set for the roll out of the discard ban is ambitious, but practical, and will need to be implemented by specific management tools to ensure its delivery.  That has been clearly recognised by the Council which includes a number of tools to support the effective delivery in its general approach.  This involves areas such as selective fishing and essentially trying to avoid unwanted catches.  <\/p><p> The European Parliament has voted on a more simple approach without providing a similar range of tools in its proposal.  Effectively, the European Parliament does not envisage a phasing in within a fishery but that on a certain date all of the species within that fishery would be subject to the discard ban.  Finding a compromise between the position of both of the institutions will be a significant challenge which will have to be addressed by the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p> In the reform, it is also important from a conservation sustainability perspective to secure agreement on how the concept known as maximum sustainable yield, MSY, will be delivered.  This is essentially a target stock size which one is trying to achieve in regard to each of the fish stocks so that one rebuilds the fish stocks and is thereby able to sustain higher catches on a sustainable basis into the future.  The Council has taken a practical approach to MSY which is to manage the fishing exploitation rates at levels capable of producing MSY by 2015, where possible, and for all stocks by 2020.  Effectively, we will be going through a transition period up to 2020.  The 2020 date is an international obligation the EU has to achieve MSY and there is an alignment between finishing the implementation of the discard ban everywhere in 2019 and achieving MSY by 2020.  <\/p><p> The application of MSY means only taking a proportion of the fish in the sea that is the right size to let the stock grow and reproduce at their most productive level.  The European Parliament, in its position, wants fishing mortality which is the amount of fish killed in a particular year set by 2015 and, in its view, that should allow the fish stocks to recover by 2020 at the latest above levels capable of producing MSY and all recovered stocks to be maintained at these levels.  The European Parliament is, therefore, setting a  biomass target by 2020 rather than a fishing mortality level.  The Council is focusing on the amount of fish being killed, the percentage of the stock, while the European Parliament is setting a level for the biomass.<\/p> <p>That represents quite a difference in terms of fisheries management.<\/p><p> Total allowable catches are allocated among member states.  There has been traditional dissatisfaction in Ireland with the share of the relevant total allowable catches which Ireland secured at the outset of the Common Fisheries Policy.  That has been an issue through each of the reforms in 1983, 1993 and 2002, and it has been an issue which has remained relatively unchanged through that period.  The share that Ireland received of the quotas available at the outset was determined by what is known as the system of relative stability, based on the historical fishery patterns in the confines of the set management areas.  That system has continued and not changed through the reforms of 1993 or 2002.  There is no support in the Council for a change in the traditional quota allocations in the current reform either and the Commission has not proposed any changes either in the Green Paper or the Commission proposal.  This is equally true of the European Parliament.<\/p><p> However, on a positive note, under the CFP arrangements agreed in 1976, a system of so-called Hague preferences was put in place under which Ireland gets an enhanced share of certain key quotas on which we are traditionally dependent if the share falls below certain set levels.  The CFP reform proposals as agreed by the Council envisage retaining this system in the way it has operated previously, that is, the Council of Ministers must endorse the implementation of the Hague preferences each December.  While Ireland has been successful each time it has invoked the system of Hague preferences, it has proved difficult to achieve because of reservations and opposition from some member states which lose out from its implementation.  It only gets invoked when the stocks are low, and therefore everyone is allocated low quotas.  When it is invoked, it reduces the quotas of others and this is why it always meets opposition.<\/p><p> Ireland had sought that the Hague preferences be permanently built into the mechanism for setting annual fishing opportunities but there was no appetite from key member states at the Council and political agreement for this course of action was not possible.  However, we have succeeded in securing the Council position in retaining the Hague preferences in the way they have been included from the outset at the CFP.<\/p><p> The European Parliament's position sees the Hague preferences as a permanent feature of the total allowable catch setting exercise under a new CFP.  However, securing the agreement of the Council to the Parliament's view is a very difficult challenge in light of the strong opposition from almost all member states.  Clearly, the important issue here is not to lose the Hague preference provision that has been in place since 1983.<\/p><p> How will the process of CFP reform unfold from here?  Since the Council has now reached its political agreement on the full general approach on the basic regulation and on the common organisation of the market, Ireland, in its role of EU Council Presidency, has a negotiating mandate for discussions with the European Parliament.  Yesterday, the first round of trilogues, meetings between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission, took place in Brussels.  There is an intensive programme of negotiations set out weekly from here on into April and then it will resume again shortly afterwards.  The trilogues have also taken place on the common organisation of the market and we are moving to the second round in that area.  The trilogues are an intensive process under the Lisbon treaty whereby there is an attempt to negotiate the agreed Council position and the agreed Parliament position into an overall agreed text.  This is especially difficult given the difficulty experienced in getting the agreement in both the Parliament and the Council.  Anyway, the Parliament had a 500 to 100 vote in favour of the position it adopted while the Council has a 26 to one agreement on the position it has adopted, but there are approximately 300 points of difference between the two positions.  Therefore, trying to negotiate movement between these two positions is the challenge.<\/p><p> The Cyprus Presidency secured agreement on a partial general approach to the European maritime and fisheries fund at last October's Agriculture and Fisheries Council.  However, the vote of the PECH committee in the European Parliament on the fund has now been delayed until the end of May.  Given that timeframe, it is considered unlikely that the Irish Presidency will be able to commence negotiations with the Parliament during its course.  However the Irish Presidency will continue to work on the fund dossier following the vote in Parliament with a view to enabling the Lithuanian Presidency to commence its negotiations with the Parliament.<\/p><p> Given all the institutions involved, the timetable for the reform is changing on a regular basis.  At present the ambition in terms of the basic regulation is to try to conclude the negotiations with the European Parliament by June.  In terms of the Common Market organisation, the ambition is to try to reach final agreement in April.  Given that the Parliament will not have voted until May in its committee and will not have taken a plenary vote until June, it will be difficult to conclude agreement on the fund under the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p> I hope that gives an outline of the reform process to date and where we stand.  We are happy to take any questions that members wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032000003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cecil Beamish","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363789200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Beamish, for the comprehensive update on where the Irish Presidency has brought the Common Fisheries Policy in conjunction with the Commission and the Parliament.

It is important we get these regular briefs in respect of what is taking place.  At times it is difficult to decipher exactly what the practical outcome will be for ordinary people who must try to sustain a living from fishing.<\/p><p>  There should be a ban in Europe on any meeting going beyond 11:30 p.m.  It is totally outrageous.  This has been going on for years and years.  A great gaisce is made about going on until 6:30 a.m.  However, people's livelihoods are depending on decisions made by fatigued negotiators and the process inevitably leads to bad decision making.  It seems that these talks, no matter what way they are organised, have gone on for years with this great macho approach to negotiation.  These are people's lives.  Everyone negotiating should be fully awake and alert when the most crucial decisions are being made.  It is obnoxious that these decisions are made at 6:30 a.m.<\/p><p>  Let us consider what the delegation has said on the issue of the discards.  It goes without saying that the idea of discarding good fish is obnoxious.  However, the devil is always in the detail and I am interested to hear the views of the fishermen's and fisherwomen's organisations in respect of how discards will work in practice.  We have seen all sorts of regulations coming from the environment agenda to farming which are laudable in themselves but which have had various unintended consequences when they have been applied.  I seek reassurance on the issue of discards, which I support.  No one can argue against it but we need to know the answer in this regard.<\/p><p>  I am concerned about the European Parliament's input with regard to the maximum sustainable yield.  The European Parliament is controlled and dominated by people who are a long way from the sea and from fishermen.  Few of the people elected to the European Parliament will depend on fishermen as an electorate.  I am concerned at the levels the European Parliament might set on a precautionary basis.<\/p> <p>I am very worried about the outcome and I ask the two officials present if it is possible to get more detail.  This seems to be one of the nub issues so is it possible to see a chart of the proposals from the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the Parliament on sustainable fishing?  Could we have the effect of each proposal on total allowable catches, so that we can have some sense of the practical effect on fishermen's lives?  The delegation put much time and effort into this document but it is very hard to get any sense of how this is likely to play out from it, depending on which of the three parties win the tug of war.<\/p><p> It is indicated that this last part poses problems because although we can control fish mortality, we cannot predict how quickly a stock will respond and at what rate.  Invariably, factors outside our control have an effect on this response.  I can envision large lobby groups arguing that if there is any risk, we should take a conservative or precautionary approach and not allow catches.  I am very concerned about that.<\/p><p> It is indicated that in January 2016 a ban will be rolled out in the North Sea south-western waters and, importantly for the Irish fleet, for fisheries of cod, haddock, whiting, Norway lobsters, common sole, plaice and hake in north-western waters.  What kind of tonnages are we talking about and what will be the effect on the Irish fishing fleet?  Baltic country parliaments can discuss the Baltic ban and the Mediterranean ban is not of concern to us; our job as an Oireachtas is to consider the greater good but particularly to defend the Irish interest.  If possible, I would like a much more detailed outline of what the likely effect of this will be on the total allowable catches and the fish that Irish fishermen can take.<\/p><p> I am disappointed that there does not appear to be anything to extend the inshore range and ensure that coastal communities get more of the fish within their range.  There does not seem to be any good news there for the small fisherman in a small boat trying to eke out a living around the coast of Ireland from Clogherhead to Lough Foyle.  I wish the Minister would put the same effort into defending inshore fishermen as he has put into defending big farmers, and there may have been a better result if that was the case.<\/p><p> Those present know my attitude to the Common Fisheries Policy.  Fianna F&aacute;il, as part of the Government, sold out in 1973.  It is a bad policy for Ireland and no other sector requires the country to give up so much national wealth to the common pool for so little in return.  One could argue that if we had our own fisheries, the austerity suffered by the country would be significantly decreased because we would have sustainable income.  I am very disappointed that there appears to be no evidence of the Minister using his position in the Presidency to lay clearly on the line that he is not satisfied with the arrangement arrived at and the need for fundamental reform to ensure that those near the coast get the lion's share of the catch.  I heard of no public meetings organised by the Minister to whip up public support for a policy to defend our vital national interest and ensure we get a fair proportion of the fish for the waters around our coast.<\/p><p> We should remember the extent of the coastal waters around Ireland at the time we entered the European Union.  I was not in government or even in politics at the time but I opposed the policy and campaigned against it as we were giving away forever our birthright in exchange for short-term grants.  That is the way the Common Fisheries Policy was framed.  If we had the money we could have got over those years, we would have had a significant amount of sustainable wealth in the country.  There is no evidence in public view or in negotiations that anything was done to try to make the people aware that this fundamental reform was taking place and there was an opportunity - which comes once every ten years - to open the issue again.  I did not hear that the Minister went to Castletownbere, Rossaveal, Killybegs, Dunmore East, Dingle or anywhere else to whip up support for public demand for a fundamental review of the policy.<\/p><p> The Minister does not even appear to have been able to bring the Council with him on the Hague preferences and we must still negotiate them every year.  I notice that the European Parliament is more with us than the Council.  The Minister was capable of defending his corner yesterday and I thought he would have at least been able to ensure that we could protect the Hague preferences.  These are total allowable catches given to us every year as part of a negotiation, and we must, effectively, hand in some of our chips in order to get them.  They should be permanent and non-negotiable.  It is interesting that the Parliament has at least the good sense to see that we should be given the Hague preferences on a permanent basis.<\/p><p> I have noted the comments today and my basic reaction is that it is a very bad deal and we have once again failed to see the potential of the seas around our island.  There is a map in my office prepared by Foras na Mara, or the Marine Institute, showing how much of the Irish territory is in water and how little is land.  Once again, we have ignored that fact and in a hurry to get a Common Fisheries Policy, we have sold out a fundamental Irish right.  I cannot endorse this as a good position for the Council and it is an abysmal failure.  Not only are we not seeing a fundamental reform of how the allocations are made but we are not even getting small pieces for the inshore fishermen or the Hague preferences.  In other words, it is an agreement on nothing except more cutbacks.  The only redeeming feature is the discards issue, which is welcome in the context of world hunger and poverty, as nobody should be throwing good food into the sea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032000005#F00300","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363789800,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Beamish and Ms Kelly for the presentation.  It is evident from the document and the presentation that coastal and fishing communities are poor relations when it comes to negotiations, particularly those in Europe.<\/p> <p>It is very evident that coastal and fishing communities are the poor relations when it comes to negotiations, particularly in Europe.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the first negotiations in 1973 and how the fishing community had been sold out in those negotiations.  At least, he and his party have come to terms with what they did in the past.  Every year since I was elected to the House I have made the point that the fishing industry is in irreversible decline because of the lack of a quota.  It has been contracting year after year because there is no political commitment within the political establishment to help sustain and grow the sector.  There is no point saying otherwise.  These communities are the poor relations when it comes to negotiations.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the map on his wall.  What is very evident from it is the amount of our territorial waters contributing beneficially to the fishing fleets of other European countries.  When one assesses all of this in political terms, there is an abject failure on the part of the political representatives on this part of our island to represent coastal and fishing communities.  Coastal communities are decimated because the fishing industry has contracted.  That industry always had a knock-on effect onshore, but all of that has disappeared.  As Deputy Noel Harrington is from Castletownbere and lives in that area, he sees this daily.  I live north west of Fenit and see it every time I go back there.  One can see it in Dingle and Rossaveal.  With the exception of a couple of small centres where there is a small number of boats, the vast majority of the fishing fleet has been sold out, compromised and effectively used as cannon fodder in the negotiations.<\/p><p> The two issues about which the witness is talking are the total allowable catch, TAC, and discards.  Even the discard issue will be determined in negotiations between the Parliament and the Council.  If the Parliament has its way, what will be the position of the fishing fleets if this measure is to be implemented by 2015?  Can the discard issue be dealt with in such a short space of time?  Dr. Beamish says there should be a compromise on it and there probably will be.  Ultimately, it is a disgrace and discards should not happen, but when one is fishing and there is a by-catch in the nets, how does one deal with it?  It is not possible to deal with the issue in a year or two.  I am certainly glad that the Council and the Parliament are taking the issue seriously.<\/p><p> The Hague preferences were mentioned by the previous speaker.  Under the Hague preferences, every year we must go, cap in hand, to try to secure some sustainable support for the industry.  That is not right.  We cannot even secure permanency in this regard.  Again, it just shows the lack of political clout to stand by an industry.  I will quote a paragraph from the presentation because it states a great deal: \"The share Ireland received of the quotas available at the outset was determined on a system of relative stability, based on historical fishing patterns in the confines of the set management areas.\"  What historical patterns?  Are they historical patterns as determined by the previous Commissioners and now by the Commission, the Council and the Parliament?  The paragraph continues: \"That system has continued since and was not changed in the CFP reforms of 1992 or 2002.  There is no support in the Council for a change in the traditional quota allocations in the current reform either and the Commission has not proposed any change.\"  Has the Irish Commissioner proposed a change?  If the Commission has not proposed any change, I do not understand why, with an Irish person representing us and given that we hold the Presidency, we are not making it a serious political issue.  Crippled with austerity, the industry continues to decline and contract, yet nothing is happening politically to defend or support an industry that has traditionally played a big role in the sustainability of rural Ireland.  The sustainability of rural Ireland, particularly coastal communities, was always dependent on both the fishing and small farming sectors, both of which have now left the horizon.<\/p><p> I do not know what else can be said.  I just cannot support the proposal.  I have been saying since the day I was elected in 2002 that there is no political commitment, irrespective of what political party has been in government since 1973, to do anything positive to try to rebuild an industry and a sector that has been abandoned and used as a compromise in negotiations.  I do not envisage any change as we move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032000006#G00200","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363790400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>My apologies for not being here for the presentation, but I have read the document.  I echo the comments of previous speakers on the lack of political will on the part of every Government to deal with the historical wrongs done to Ireland in the context of our fishing rights.  It is interesting that prior to Ireland joining the EEC, the Commission gave itself sole responsibility for the conservation of fish stocks in European waters in the full knowledge that Ireland, England and Denmark were negotiating to join at the time.  The European Economic Community, as it was then known, set out to steal the resources from us and hamstring us in negotiations that would take place after we had joined.  The result has been enshrined in the EU treaties since.  We have always been playing catch-up in trying to undo something that was enshrined in EU law before we joined the European Union.  I realise it is not the responsibility of the officials present.  It is a political role.  Unfortunately, this and previous Governments have not attempted to take this on and try to redress some of the wrongs done.  That has led to the Hague preferences and the fact that we cannot even have them enshrined in the Common Fisheries Policy.  We will have to continuously use up political and negotiating capital every year to ensure the Hague preferences are enshrined in negotiations.  That leads to huge difficulties, whereby we cannot concentrate on other issues of importance to coastal and fishing communities.<\/p><p>  The agreement on discards is welcome.  However, much will depend on the actual technicalities of how the measure will be implemented and what structures will be put in place in order that fishermen will be supported in getting alternative gear that will let juvenile fish go.  However, there might still be a by-catch.  It is vital that fishermen not be penalised if, in implementing the measures introduced under the CFP, they still have a by-catch that will have to be landed.  This should be looked on in a favourable way if somebody is participating and doing his or her best to reduce the number of discards.  That will probably emerge in the detail of how the discard policy will be implemented.<\/p><p>  One of the issues raised in the conference last week was regionalisation and how regional decision making was envisaged to take place in the future.  In our case, there might be eight or nine countries' fleets operating in our waters and there will be the issue of trying to secure agreement on a regional basis for management structures and so forth and how effectively they will work.<\/p> <p>Will the Commission fully support the case if all countries bar one agree conservation or management measures?

I have an interest in the progress being made with the Common Fisheries Policy.  Regrettably, picking up an analogy used last night in a television current affairs programme, the hairdressing sector in this country probably has more political clout in terms of votes than the fishing sector.  We do not face problems because of a lack of political commitment by the Minister and his officials, we face problems as a result of a general lack of understanding of what is involved nationally.<\/p><p>  There are twin processes in a European context - the Common Agricultural Policy, being dealt with by the same Minister, and the Common Fisheries Policy.  We would be hard pressed to find any media coverage, support or comment good, bad or indifferent on the Common Fisheries Policy while thousands of people would protest over the CAP.  For some communities on the coast the progress with the Common Fisheries Policy is of greater interest than with the Common Agricultural Policy, important as that is for the State.  It would be ridiculous to add to the confusion by engaging into Don Quixote type battles on a Common Fisheries Policy when trying to sustain an industry that is rightly challenged internationally, with visiting fleets going after fish stocks that in some cases we do not have full scientific information on.  Dr. Beamish and Ms Kelly have outlined some of the key issues in the Common Fisheries Policy.  The ban on discards, maximum sustainable yield proposals, internationally transferable quotas and the Hague preferences are key to the sustainability of the industry.<\/p><p>  We can debate what happened in 1973 but I could go back to the 1600s, when the Spanish were landing fish in this country.  Many Irish people made great money at the time from imposing tariffs on Spanish fleets so we can talk about the international context going back centuries.  We can talk about how Iceland and the Faroe Isles have handled their mackerel fisheries and say we should do the same but it is more complicated than that.<\/p><p>  I live in Castletownbere, which is now one of the designated fishery harbour centres.  There was a time, however, when fish were being exported to Billingsgate and we got nothing for it.  The fisherman of the town were treated like dirt.  Billingsgate was the only outlet but thankfully times have moved on.  In some respects the fishing industry has consolidated into a few ports, which is regrettable because some of the traditional ports have lost out.  We tried to address that but we must fight the battle in front of us at present.  It was alluded to by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Deputy Ferris, where the European Parliament and media almost have a consensus view there should be no fishing because we are killing fish and that view is gathering momentum.   There is huge European political pressure to introduce the discard ban.  I agree with the introduction of a discard ban on a phased basis, although I am concerned about how it will work for fishermen on the ground.  I would urge the industry to engage with the Department.  Supports are needed to help the industry with technical measures and to look at proposals the industry would bring forward to reduce the amount of discards.  This is a complex problem. It is not as easy as people think - that we should just avoid catching fish a boat does not have a quota for.  For some mixed fisheries, everything is in one basin and it is not practical to suggest separating haddock from pollock or plaice.  I agree with the approach taken on targeting the pelagic fishery first, which is a cleaner fishery.<\/p><p>  There will still be difficulties.  We are trying to impose a ban on discards on a pelagic industry while visiting fleets are fishing almost for the entire year and it is not credible they are doing so within their own total allowable catches.  For many of the main pelagic fisheries, there should be a complete suspension of effort for the summer months.  When the Irish fleet is tied up, there is no reason anyone else should be fishing there.  Other fleets do not have astronomical total allowable catches and would be able to catch the permitted amount in the same season as the Irish fleet.  A complete summer time ban should be discussed as part of this.<\/p><p>  The MSY is a hugely difficult proposal but ultimately it will ensure the growth of some of our more valuable species that lend economic support through onshore processing.  Explaining the concept of maximum sustainable yield is difficult in many of these communities.  There is a huge job of work to be done by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to ensure those on the deck of a vessel understand what this means.  It will require enormous effort but I hope the industry will see the potential benefit of this.  It will be painful but Irish fishermen have taken the lead in the Celtic Sea herring management.  Irish fishermen are willing to make sacrifices when they can see better results that will lead to more sustainable fisheries for them and the generations to come after them.  It is in that context that we can achieve the maximum sustainable yield proposals.<\/p><p>  I missed the start of presentation so I might have missed proposals on ITQ concessions.  It is disappointing the Hague preferences have not been given permanency.  It is interesting that every year we fight and achieve the Hague preferences and it is right that we must surrender some political capital to achieve that because it is better if we focus on the battles we can win.  I accept this is a challenging time for the Irish fishing industry in the white and pelagic sectors.  The Commission's proposals on discards are universally popular but, equally, they are difficult to enforce.<\/p><p>  I look forward to ongoing briefings on the CFP and wish the officials well in their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032000008#J00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1363791600,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Harrington for his observations.

If I go beyond that, please pull me back.<\/p><p>  One of the main issues of concern to the Irish fishing industry is relative stability.  Some of the principles were agreed in the 1970s and the code was rolled out from the early 1980s.  The reforms in 1992 and 2002 both had requests for change to the relative stability provisions.  Neither of them was successful.  In the context of the current reform, it was the subject of a lengthy debate in 2009 and 2010 with those in the fishing industry.  Some in the fishing industry demanded larger shares.  Given the political reality that such demands had not been acceded to in the two previous reforms, greater thought on how to approach that issue in the current reform is needed.  The then Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Tony Killeen, published a document which, following discussion on relative stability, had the support of the fishing industry.  It stated: &quot;Ireland believes that Relative Stability and its attendant TACs &amp;amp; Quotas, whilst imperfect, must remain the primary community mechanism to manage fish stocks.&quot;  Ireland firmly believes that, while imperfect, the TAC and quota system must remain the bedrock of access to fishery resources in the Common Fisheries Policy.  It continued: &quot;However, Ireland advocates that adjustments can be made to the present share out (relative stability) of a number of white fish and pelagic stocks so that the future allocation of Community resources is better adjusted to match today's needs and is seen to deliver increased shares of stocks adjacent to shores for coastal Member States through a range of mechanisms including the improved use of swaps.&quot;  It was looking at the use of mechanisms that were within the realm of what was likely to be proposed to try to achieve progress in that area.  In the most recent stock allocation of boarfish a couple of years ago, Ireland achieved two thirds of EU stock.  This is now an important fishery, with 56,000 tons of quota this year.  <\/p><p>  The Common Fisheries Policy reform is a very large package and legal instrument and not all of it is available for members, as the financial fund that would support the policy is not agreed and the areas in which spending would be prioritised or permitted have not yet been finalised.  Thus, there are parts of the CFP that have not been settled and are not available to members. <br \/><i><\/i>One of the proposals the Minister put into the package in respect of discards was agreed in December during our Presidency.  The terminology that is used for a discard ban in Europe is a landing obligation; in other words, one cannot throw fish away but must land them.  I will quote: &quot;When a landing obligation for a fish stock is being introduced [in other words, when a discard ban for fish stock is being introduced], fishing opportunities [which is code for quotas] shall be set taking account of the change from setting fishing opportunities to reflect landings to setting fishing opportunities to reflect catches on the basis that for first and subsequent years, discarding of that stock will no longer be allowed.&quot;  The principle was put into the package agreed in February that quotas must be set, once a discard ban is brought into account, taking account of the fact that fish that were previously being discarded will now be landed.  The quota must be adjusted to reflect that.  That could be very significant.  If we look at the levels of discards in Ireland between 2003 and 2009, among our top ten commercial white fish species there was an average catch of 36,600 tons per year, with associated discards of 14,000 tons per year.  That gave an average discard rate of 38%.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about the impact of this.  The figures are all set out clearly in the atlas produced by the Marine Institute and BIM for the Department, which is available from the institute or BIM.  We set out the level of discards for each fishery in order to examine the practical implications.<\/p><p>  With regard to overall discards, the FAO did a global review and found that the north east Atlantic, the area in which Ireland operates, has the highest discard level in the world.  It was estimated at 1.3 million tons, and the majority of discards took place in EU fisheries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032000009#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cecil Beamish"},{"type":"speech","time":1363791600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Would the majority of those discards be pelagic or demersal fish?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032000009#K00300","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363791600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Probably demersal.  There would be some discards of pelagic fish but there are not strong reasons for large-scale discarding of pelagic fish.  Clearly, if the reform policy could prevent unwanted catches, particularly of juvenile fish, that would contribute significantly to building stock to higher levels and sustaining higher catches.<\/p><p>  The real debate on relative stability was on the Commission's proposal for the introduction of individual transferable quotas and the privatisation of quotas to individual level, allowing them to be sold, bought up, concentrated and aggregated.  Deputies were concerned about inshore fishermen, fishermen with smaller boats, family-owned trawlers and so on.  That Commission proposal was regarded by the Government as a significant threat to the way in which our fishing industry is organised and a significant threat to the national quotas.  Very strong opposition, with unanimous support from the fishing industry, was exerted in respect of that central aspect of the Commission's proposals for reform.  The fear in the Irish context was that the larger industrial companies that operate fishing fleets in white fish fisheries to the south and pelagic fisheries in the North Sea would effectively buy up Irish quotas.  If that happened, landings to Ireland would diminish significantly, as would the associated employment downstream.  There was an intense debate and Ireland was at the forefront of opposition to this proposal.  That element is not in the Council's agreed position today.  It is there to a small extent in the Parliament's position but it is not in the Council's position.  That was a significant change in what the Commission had proposed in this reform and was the core debate about the code of management.<\/p><p>  With regard to quotas for inshore fishermen or smaller fishing operations, the principle agreed in the general approach of the Council is that it is for member states to decide how to distribute their quotas.  This morning we had an initial meeting with the fishing industry for about four hours, updating them on the reform process.  We keep close contact with them on what is happening in the reform process.<\/p> <p>The fishermen sit down with the Department, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and others on a monthly basis to pool all the information and decide, essentially, on the quota arrangements for the following period.  That process will be allowed to continue under the reform.  It would not have been permitted if the quotas had been privatised under a individual transferable quota system.  As the extent to which quotas are available for particular segments of the industry is subject to national decision, there can be a national debate on it.<\/p><p> I am trying to stay within areas that do not involve policy, but it is not easy.  It is difficult to assess the exact implications of the decision that has been made with regard to maximum sustainable yield.  The stock situation changes every year.  That is nature.  There are significant fluctuations in many species.  The maximum sustainable yield is a target that is being aimed at.  The pace at which a stock moves towards that target varies from stock to stock.  A stock might be subject to a different trend for wider reasons than the level of fishing.  For the last two or three years, the December Council has been receiving proposals from the Commission which have focused on aiming to achieve the maximum sustainable yield.  The Council has decided to do this on a graduated basis.  It is not as if the process of aiming to achieve the maximum sustainable yield will start when the new reform comes in.  We have been moving in that direction.  An increasing number of stocks are reaching maximum sustainable yield.  It is not a goal that is beyond many of the stocks.  It is difficult to quantify the exact effect of this measure.  According to the Council decision, attempts will be made to achieve maximum sustainable yield by 2015 where possible and in all cases by 2020.  This has quite a long lead-in period.  It has been guiding the way quota decisions have been taken for a number of years.<\/p><p> I was also asked about the position on the Hague preferences.  At the moment, both versions of the text reflect the Hague preferences.  It is not the case that they are in one version but not in the other.  They are reflected differently in each version of the text.  The Council position is the one that has been in place since the outset of the Common Fisheries Policy, which means the Hague preferences will remain.  The opposition to the retention of the preferences in the Common Fisheries Policy has not won out.  They will remain under both versions of the text.  It is not the case that Ireland has lost with regard to the Hague preferences.  I do not think I have missed anything.  As I said, I do not wish to stray into policy areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032000009#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cecil Beamish","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363792200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I am conscious that the sub-committee is meeting this afternoon as well.

A proposal will come from the Commission and will be decided on by the Council.  The Common Fisheries Policy text is giving guidance to the Commission on how it makes the proposal.  When we are bringing in the discard ban, we cannot simply propose a quota as if nothing has changed.  The quota must take account of the fact that from 2016 or 2018 - the date that applies to the stock in question - the previous discards of a stock will have to be landed.  In the case of each of these stocks, a higher quota will have to be put in place to reflect the discarding of that stock which will no longer take place.  That is the principle.  The Council cannot determine that in advance - it can simply set out the principle.  The Commission makes the proposal to the Council on the quota.  This is one of the principles that the Commission will have to take into account in proposing a quota.  It will also have to consider where the stock is and the direction in which the stock is going, etc.  This will be taken into account when the discard ban is introduced.  I am referring to the Council's proposal.  The Parliament has not done anything like that.  The Parliament proposal does not reflect the idea that the quota will have to be changed to take account of the fact that the sizeable discards we saw in the past will no longer take place and will have to be landed.  This is another example of something the Council has worked through in greater detail.  It has in place a greater range of flanking measures around the decision to introduce a gradual discard ban.  All of that will have to be worked through during the discussion.<\/p><p>  I did not come back to the Deputy on the question of regionalisation, which he raised earlier.  Everybody agrees that a \"one size fits all\" Common Fisheries Policy is not desirable because it would not work from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and the western waters.  It gets complicated after that.  In most of the fisheries around Ireland that matter, at least two or three big member states are fishing alongside the Irish fishing fleet.  It is desirable to be able to make targeted regional decisions on measures to manage stocks in particular sea basins and areas.  The question of how this can be done has been the subject of a fairly detailed debate at Council level over a couple of years.  One of the principles of the debate is that there must be fairness in the decision-making process.  It is easy to envisage how two or three bigger member states might form a gang and do something that a smaller member state might not like and might wish to vote down or overrule.  The fisheries sector is a very competitive environment.<\/p><p>  There has been a debate on this at Council level.  The outcome, as set out in the text that was agreed in February, is that when unanimous agreement on a set of measures is reached by all the member states involved in the fishery in a particular area, the Commission will fast-track those measures into European law.  That was seen as important by Ireland because if there is to be fairness in the system, all fishermen fishing the same species side-by-side under European flags should be subject to the same EU rules.  The relevant coastal member state - Ireland in the case of Irish waters - should be able to apply those EU laws to all the vessels fishing in its area.  That is the version of regionalisation that the Council has supported.  If unanimous agreement is not reached, the Commission will have to make a proposal in the normal way.  Like any other proposal, it will have to go through the co-decision process.  Unanimity among the member states involved will be required if a proposal is to be fast-tracked.  That is the Council version.<\/p><p>  The proposal made by the Parliament is different.  Essentially, it has suggested that each member state should make the rules for its own fleet and that an attempt should be made to co-ordinate between the member states.  In the view of the Council and the Irish Government, that is a problematic way of going about shared fisheries.  At a minimum, it would lead to a perception that fishermen under different flags in the same fishery are operating under different rules.  If that happens, very negative things will happen in the fishery and in terms of perceptions.  There is quite a difference between the approaches to regionalisation of the Council and the Parliament.  Member states that tend to speak about the repatriation of powers tend to prefer the Parliament's approach as it would allow them to make the rules under national law.  Almost all of Ireland's fisheries are heavily shared fisheries.  Large fleets from other countries are fishing alongside our own fishermen.  That is why the Irish Government has been supporting the approach that the Council included in the February agreement.  Everybody wants regionalisation, but how will it work in practice?  How can it be fair to the fishermen on the ground?  That is the debate.  If something like the Council version of the text is adopted, significant progress will have been made because it will speed up the process of arriving at more tailored solutions for fisheries in particular areas.<\/p> <p>That would obviously be a good development. <\/p><p> On the debate about who has access to what waters, etc., this was one of the first items of the reform process on which there was no desire for change.  From the outset, member states did not seek to change the six and 12 mile arrangements that have been in place since 1964, long before the Common Fisheries Policy was introduced.  The limits were viewed as elements that were settled, as it were, even before the Commission made a proposal.  The Commission did not make a proposal to change the six and 12 mile limits in the Green Paper.  However, it should be noted that fishermen are not treated differently in terms of their access to a stock, whether inside or outside a zone.  The stock is divided out on a relative stability basis and the member states then decide which fishermen receive what share of the national quota.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032000010#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cecil Beamish","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363792800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Did Ireland make a proposal to change or extend the limits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032000011#M00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363792800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>There was a proposal early on in the process but there was no support for it.

The colleagues with me today are Dr. John Sweeney and Mr. John Bohan, both members of the advisory group.  Also with me is Ms Teresa Leonard, assistant secretary in the Department of Social Protection, who has responsibility for the administration of the particular payments we are discussing today.<\/p><p>  I will provide a brief description of the content of the report and we will then be happy to answer any questions.  The report is concerned with a policy area that has been the subject of a number of reports over the years.  Child income support covers the area of child benefit, the major child income support payment, but also the areas of qualified child increases, the payments paid with weekly social welfare payments to various families, and family income support.  Some &euro;2.8 billion will be spent in 2013 on these payments by the Department of Social Protection.  This accounts for approximately 14% of total social welfare expenditure of approximately &euro;20 billion.  Of this almost &euro;3 billion in child income support payments, child benefit accounts for two-thirds of the expenditure and it is paid to 609,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children.  It is a universal payment, while the other payments, the qualified child increase and the family income support payment, are related to families' income situation. <\/p><p>  The advisory group recognises that family income supports have two main objectives.  First, they assist all families with the costs of raising children and second, they play a role in reducing poverty in households with children.  These objectives remain valid and are particularly significant during a time of recession and high unemployment.  However, the effectiveness of these payments in addressing these objectives has been examined in various reports.  The evidence suggests that while we spend significantly higher amounts on cash benefits on families than other OECD countries, other countries get better outcomes.  The reasons for this are complex, but the main reason is that direct income support for children is not the only consideration when child poverty is an issue.  The other major considerations are parental income and the supports available for parents to go out to work and the services available for children.  Nevertheless, direct income support for children is a major factor, but it is not the only factor in addressing child poverty.<\/p><p>  The advisory group was established as a result of one of the commitments in the programme for Government and was asked to examine a number of specific issues on a cost-reducing or cost neutral basis.  It is important to emphasise this was the case, because if one was to examine child and family income supports without these constraints, one might recommend a different design of income supports.  The group started its work programme by prioritising this area of family and child income supports.  <\/p><p>  The conclusions reached by the group were as follows.  The primary conclusion reached by the group in its entirety, which is composed of outside experts and representatives of Departments, was that child benefit should remain as a universal benefit.  I am well aware that is not necessarily the view held by all participants in this debate, but the group was very clear it wanted child benefit to remain as a universal payment for all children.  At the same time, we recognised that the system could be changed so as to better target children in low income families.  We looked at a number of options for changes to the child income support system and decided there were two main options.  One was the taxation of child benefit and the other was the two-tier payment, which is the option we recommend.  We recognised there were arguments in favour of taxing child benefit, but the main reason we did not consider this the better option was that it only deals with child benefit and not with the other payments made to children.  Therefore, it would not bring about any significant reform of the child income support system.<\/p><p>  There are other problems with the taxation of child benefits, not least the question of the legal issues surrounding cohabiting couples and married couples.  I would like to emphasise, however, that it is possible to tax child benefit.  Reports on this issue go back to the 1970s.  In the past, there was emphasis on how difficult it would be to tax child benefit, for technical reasons.  However, it seems to the advisory group from the information made available to it by the Revenue Commissioners that the technical problems of taxing child benefit no longer exist and this is now possible.  The reasons we did not prefer that option were not because it could not be done, but for the other reasons I have outlined.<\/p><p>  While recognising there is no one perfect solution, the group favoured the two-tier approach.  This means there would be a universal first-tier payment in respect of all children, although at a lower level than that paid currently.  Then there would be a second-tier or supplementary payment which would be paid to low-income families and which would replace the current qualified child increases and family income supplements.<\/p> <p>We concluded that this second-tier system would have advantages in terms of incentives to work in particular.  As the committee is aware, a person on jobseeker's allowance who gets a job will lose not just his or her weekly jobseeker's allowance but also the child income support payments that go with it.  If this second-tier system was in place that person would be able to move into a job and if the income from the job was low, would be able to retain some of the second tier payment.  Therefore, there would not be the same disincentive to take up work as is the case currently, for jobseekers who have a number of children.<\/p><p> When we were examining the two-tier payment approach, we looked in detail at the design and the financial implications of the system.  I wish to clearly emphasise that we took a particular example of how the two-tier system would work.  We are not saying that this is the best possible system; we simply took an example to analyse what the consequences would be and to show how it would work in practice. <\/p><p> It is a matter for Government to decide exactly what limits should apply to the application of a second-tier payment, the amount of the universal payment, what limits should apply to the second-tier payment and what the withdrawal or tapering rate should be for that second-tier payment.  All of those factors are inter-related but a number of different packages can be looked at to see which one would yield the best possible results.<\/p><p> We picked a particular package to analyse in detail and these are set out in the report.  This report was completed in March 2012.  The particular example we used involved taking the then current rate of child benefit which was &euro;140 a month plus the increase for a qualified child which was approximately &euro;30 a month.  At the time, that combined rate was roughly &euro;63 a week.  We operated on the presumption that &euro;63 a week would be the top rate between the basic rate of child benefit and the second-tier amount.  The proportion universal to the two-tier is &euro;52.48 at present.  We proposed that instead the universal element would be 40% to 60% selective.  This would mean that a family with one child would receive a second-tier payment up to about &euro;35,000.  We would start at a figure of &euro;25,000.  We chose that figure because that is the at-risk-of-poverty figure for a family with two children at present.  There is nothing particularly sacrosanct about the figure but it is the reason we started there.  If the scheme proposed in our package was to be applied, then any family with an income of under &euro;25,000 would get the full &euro;63 a week.  A family with one child could have an income of up to about &euro;35,000 and get some part of the second-tier payment.  A family with two children could have an income of up to &euro;45,000 and get some of the second-tier payment.<\/p><p> About 60% of all families would get a second-tier payment under the package we have set out.  There would be a 20% withdrawal rate of the second-tier payment as payment increased.  I emphasise again that this is just one possible package to illustrate how this payment system would work.<\/p><p> It is a matter for Government to decide what the particular limits should be.  One of the major advantages of the second-tier system is the degree of flexibility it allows in that different levels of basic payment and selective payment can be made, different tapering amounts and income limits can be decided.<\/p><p> I wish to emphasise that we did not suggest that this would ever be done in one fell swoop; it could be implemented over a number of years.  It is a matter now for Government to decide whether it should go ahead and if so, to analyse different packages to see which ones would best meet the requirements for improving child poverty outcomes and reducing disincentives to work.  We are happy to take any questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032000003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ita Mangan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363785000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I take the point that child income support is not the only determinant of child poverty.  I also take the point that in most other OECD countries a relatively smaller amount of expenditure seems to be yielding better results certainly in respect of child poverty.  This is because a much greater proportion of expenditure on child support is expended on services in those countries as opposed to direct income.<\/p><p>  The terms of reference of the advisory group are quite narrow.  It has been asked to consider the fixed amount to be spent on child support and to recast it in such a way as to make it more equitable.  I understand the point made by Ms Mangan that just one figure of &euro;63 has been examined and that this is based on the benefit plus the qualified child income support.  That being said, if those figures are applied even with the change in child benefit, the results come out pretty much the same.<\/p><p>  My party has examined a few models of payment.  In some cases the difficulties - if I can put it like that - to which the report gives rise when using this figure are reduced and in other cases they are exacerbated.  I cannot imagine any government, taking into account the national finances and people's circumstances, would be able to work off a figure which is very different to the figure proposed by the advisory group.  For example, it would be unthinkable for the Government to decide to work off a much lower figure in view of the fact of the large and growing proportion of our people who have very little and consistently less disposable income on which to live.  If the figure is too high it will not be cost-neutral, as is the mandate of the advisory group, with the result that the State might have to spend even more on child income support with very marginal results for our extra expenditure.<\/p><p>  I refer to the figures used by Ms Mangan and any of the figures my party has used in our study.  These show that it would help people who are solely dependent on social assistance payments, in other words, means-tested social welfare payments.  The problem is that it will hit working people in the lower income bracket as well.  These people might be in receipt of stamp-related social welfare payments and a partner might be working part-time or in low income employment.<\/p><p>  For example, I refer to page 28 of the report which deals with family income supplement.  This is an income supplement paid to people on very low incomes to encourage them to stay in work rather than depending on social welfare.  These workers will have dependent children and they are at the lowest end of the income bracket.  The report states:<blockquote> More significantly, however, families in receipt of FIS, particularly those consisting of only one child, will experience a reduction in their overall income [these are the lowest income earners in the country]. Analysis carried out by DSP in the case of parents in receipt of FIS shows that over 80% would lose a portion of their income supports as a consequence of introducing a two-tier CIS payment. ... The analysis shows that over two thirds of parents in receipt of FIS would lose between &euro;1 and &euro;100 per week and less than 20% would gain in the region of &euro;1 to &euro;50. Likewise one-parent families in receipt of the OPF and FIS will see their income reduced given that these payments can be paid concurrently.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>The report indicates that there are other categories in the low-income bracket, namely, people who cannot qualify for family income supplement because they are self-employed or because they are not working the requisite number of hours, and they will gain in this respect.  Many people on low income who are in employment will be hit in this respect.  It is also true to say that the squeezed middle, with whom we are all only too familiar, will also be disproportionately hit.  Page 23 of the report states:<blockquote><br \/>Either option [that is, the taxation option or the two-tier system option] would mean that middle to upper income deciles would on average experience losses in their weekly disposable income, with the most significant losses being experienced by those in the middle income deciles, which is where most households with children are located in the income distribution.  <\/blockquote>Therefore, in order to get desirable results on one side, one will have some very undesirable consequences on the other side.  <\/p><p> One of the terms of reference of the advisory group was to bring in a system which would help to incentivise people to work.  The advisory group's report states that the effect of such a system or incentives to work would be mixed at best.<\/p><p> On the general question of child poverty and taking the model the advisory group has used, page 23 of its reports states: &quot;Poverty levels would reduce marginally under the two-tier CIS [system]&quot;.  I recognise the work the advisory group has done.  While I applaud its research and the findings and I am sure they will be useful and helpful to the advisory group's future work, I have found that using this model - or any model I have tried to put through the system - gives rise to as many, or sometimes more, problems as it tends to solve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032000004#D00300","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363785600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions.  I was almost lost in the tables in the report.  Sometimes when one looks at statistics it is hard to glean exactly what they indicate.<\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that the group considers that the universal child payment should be paid in respect of all children.  That was a good outcome, albeit that the effect of what was being proposed would be a reduced universal child payment, given the advisory group's remit that it had to be cost neutral and cost reducing.  That restriction was difficult for the advisory group given that our population is increasing, more people depend on the family income supplement and more people are qualifying for the qualified child increase.  Taking account of all those factors, it means that whatever the advisory group came up with at the other end would have a negative impact on somebody or other.  I would love to have seen a report that would have allowed the members of the advisory group to use their imagination to formulate a child income support system that recognised the universality of the existing system and to decide how to distribute another pot of gold to tackle child poverty.  Perhaps in time we will get to that.  I welcome the report.   <\/p><p>  I welcomed the fact that the Minister when answering questions last week recognised the benefits of social transfer, especially in tackling poverty.  I am concerned that if we start to proceed with this intended model, it will have a detrimental effect, especially when we consider the way the second tier is measured and qualified in terms of a means test, whether it is those who already qualify for qualified child allowance or family income supplement, given the changes that have occurred in FIS in particular in recent years in that more people are getting it but qualification for it is more restrictive.<\/p><p>  Would Ms Mangan have projections for this year, and the next five years, of the number of children who would benefit from child benefit?  I presume Ms Mangan would have some indication of those figures.  If the population rate increases as it is currently, an extra 100,000 or 200,000 children would benefit from child benefit and that would have an effect on the overall budget.  There are figures in the report on the spend, which has reduced for this year and the previous year, but the figures for the number who are benefiting is increasing.  That shows the effects of this measure this year in particular on families, especially those who might not be dependent on social welfare but who are on low and middle incomes.<\/p><p>  The report was submitted to the Minister last April but we did not have sight of it until February.

I welcome that the advisory group is examining the overall impact of support to children.  The view is that the universal benefit will be retained and I have some questions around that.  Can Ms Mangan give more detail on the reason she believes taxation would hit the lower-income families if child benefit was taxed from the point of view that those who earn the most should pay more?  Why has she come to the clear position that she does not believe that taxation would be a good format to use regarding the income received in families?<\/p><p>  Ms Mangan spoke about the two-tier system but the beauty of the universal child benefit is that very little work has to go into the administration of it.  It is just paid out to everybody.  If we start changing the system, how much extra work would have to be done to examine the second tier?  What resources would have to go into that?  Would that offset the costs that Ms Mangan said may be saved in some areas?

In this report we did not try in any way to suggest this was a perfect solution.  In fact, we clearly state that there is not one perfect solution and we recognised, as Deputy O'Dea quoted from the report, the downsides of the consequences of the two-tier system we are proposing.  However, I would make two comments about that.  First, any change to any system that is proposed within a cost neutral structure inevitably results in losses to some people.<\/p> <p>It just is not possible within a cost-saving structure.  I would have loved Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s scenario of being able to design a child income-support system from scratch with no restrictions on cost but that is not the world we live in and that was not the remit we were given, which would have been nice.  However, I wish to make the point that some people have to lose.  The big losers from the proposal we have made would in fact be middle and higher income earners because they would not get any part of the second-tier payment.  Within the lower-income group there would unquestionably be losses in particular for parents with one child who are getting FIS but that would be counterbalanced by significant gains for people who do not qualify for FIS, at present and, for example, self-employed people who do not qualify for FIS, and also people who do not meet the hours requirements for FIS.<\/p><p> The group has gone on since then to examine working-age payments.  Within that context we are looking closely at some type of new in-work benefit to replace FIS.  As we all know, FIS has had a chequered history.  It took years before it was accepted and for people to apply for it in any great number.  It is still the case that most commentators say that not everyone who qualifies for FIS is applying for it for whatever reason, which we will not necessarily examine today.  It is generally accepted &ndash; I am of the view &ndash; that it is not a satisfactory in-work payment in its present form and that some form of in-work payment is required.  That is one of the areas on which the group is working at present.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh raised the number of children getting child benefit.  I cannot make predictions for the future but I can point out that one of the problems for us as a country &ndash; it is also one of the benefits for us as a country &ndash; from a child income-support point of view is the increase in the number of children.  For example, between 2005 and 2012 an extra 100,000 children qualified for child benefit.  In 2012 we were paying child benefit in respect of 100,000 more children than we paid in 2005.  That obviously has resource consequences for the Government in terms of financing it.<\/p><p> On the subject of where the report goes from here, it was presented to the Minister in April last and the advisory group does not have any function in publishing the report or making any decisions about it.  That is entirely a matter for the Government.  We have discussed the report with the Minister and a number of different bodies but it is not my function to comment on the precise timing of the publication of the report.  That is a matter for the Minister.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Joan Collins on the question of taxation, we did not say taxation is necessarily a bad solution; we said we preferred the two-tier option because it produced a much better level of reform of the system and because it had better poverty and incentive outcomes.  The effect of taxation would be severe for certain low income families because, for example, at the current rate of child benefit, which is &euro;130 a month, if one was on the 20% tax rate one&rsquo;s child benefit would effectively be reduced to &euro;104 and if one is on the 41% tax rate it would reduce to &euro;77.  Given that the 41% tax rate kicks in at a relatively low level of income one would have much more significant losses under the tax system if one were to introduce a tax on child benefit than one would under the model that we have set out.  I repeat again that the model we have set out is only one model.<\/p><p> As Deputy O&rsquo;Dea pointed out, the poverty outcomes for the model we produced were marginally better but it seems to me that any improvement in poverty outcomes is worth trying to achieve.  Depending on which particular model one picked, the poverty outcomes might be better in some models.  I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s analysis that finding the right mix of amounts and tapers would be difficult but it still can be done.  Improvements in poverty outcomes are always desirable and worth pursuing.  I will invite Dr. Sweeney to add to what I have said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032000005#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ita Mangan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363786200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I wish to emphasise that our starting point is not ideal because there are huge inequities in the current system.

What we propose is an instrument that is quite versatile.  There is much reported consensus on keeping child benefit universal.  We did not have to agree on a rate for child benefit.  A universal payment of untaxed child benefit could be paid at the rate of &euro;5 a month and the principle of universality is respected.

Ms Leonard might wish to contribute further on the issue.  However, the Department is happy that it can be done without incurring major costs.  The proposal is that from the point of view of assessing whether people would qualify for the second-tier payment there would be an online application system similar to the ROS system for taxation, which would be self-assessed to a degree, obviously with controls.

The figure is low.  I would prefer the income threshold to be set at a higher rate in order to best protect those struggling at this time.

The annual savings compared to the existing child income support measures would be in the order of &euro;186 million, rising to &euro;193 million as a result of savings in the case of secondary benefits.  My position is that such savings arising from reform of the child benefit system should be targeted at the delivery of high quality child care services.  The lack of affordable child care services is a major barrier for single parents in returning to the workforce, which is the desired outcome for people considering this issue.  Any change to the child benefit structure must not be a simple cost cutting exercise but part of broader reform, including the delivery of affordable child care services.  Would Ms Mangan be in favour of savings being targeted at the provision of affordable child care services?  One of the members of the advisory group, Ms Mary Murphy, spoke about this matter on television some time ago and it appears that at least some members of the group would be in favour of providing the type of child care service that is essential if we are to get people back to work and avoid the poverty trap.  <\/p><p> I will contribute later on other issues if I get an opportunity to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032000006#F00500","speaker":"1013","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363786800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates.  They had a difficult job, but at last somebody has tackled the issue.  <\/p><p>  I wish to make some observations.  On the make-up of the advisory group, I note with disappointment that it does not include a representative of the Children's Alliance, Barnardos, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or the National Women's Council of Ireland.  It is mostly made up of departmental officials who, obviously, will try to make savings for the Department.  I am not taking from the work of the group or implying it was not done properly, but such representation would have been welcome in seeking the point of view of the organisations mentioned.<\/p><p>  Many statistics, facts and figures have been given to us, but I note that child benefit payments benefit 1.16 million children.  If we take account of family income supplement, we are talking about a mere 57,000 children, which amounts to a huge difference.  The family income supplement figures have been stagnant since 2009.  There was a &euro;6 increase in 2010 and the supplement benefits people to the tune of &euro;360.  In addition, self-employed persons are excluded and we all know that the self-employed are suffering, as they have nowhere to turn.  They are even finding it difficult to access social welfare payments when their businesses go belly-up, so to speak.  Those who are struggling have nowhere to turn to for help.  Therefore, the reduction in child benefit will hit the self-employed.<\/p><p>  While I agree with it being a universal payment, it is very difficult to stand over this when we see the figures bandied about in recent hours for the wages earned by individuals in the banking sector.  If they have children, they, too, qualify for a universal payment, yet this morning I heard a woman say on the Pat Kenny radio show that she had to go to the community welfare officer for money to buy a pair of shoes for her child because she could not afford to buy them.  She said she had sent the child to school in her Wellingtons this morning because she could not buy the child a pair of shoes.  I am sorry, but it claws at my heart to think that is happening in this country.<\/p><p>  The reduction in child benefit will affect people badly.  In particular, it will affect low to medium income earners who may have an income of, say, &euro;50,000, but what is their disposable income at the end of the month?  Many of the people concerned who are working may have less disposable income than someone on social welfare by the time they pay all of their bills.  We must closely examine the base figure.  I accept it is not the job of the representatives to do this but the Government's.  This entire issue warrants a much deeper discussion, perhaps among the members of this committee without the representatives being present.  Other groups are due to come before the committee to discuss it, but before the Government makes a decision, we need to discuss it in detail.  <\/p><p>  When we debated this issue in the Seanad at the time of the budget, I recall the Minister for Social Protection saying she would not implement these changes until a proper child care system was in place.  When I refer to \"child care\", I mean child care services in rural Ireland, as well as in urban Ireland.  I live in rural Ireland and know how difficult it is for someone working to have a child attending a rural school.  If someone is working in a nearby town and he or she has to collect the child to bring him or her to child care, it does not work.  We must examine the model where after-school care is provided in rural schools.  I am aware from speaking to a number of the schools that they are willing to co-operate and put in place child care services for children after school.<\/p><p>  With Ms Madden, I was not in favour of taxing child benefit because I had worked out the same figures as her for the way people would suffer whether they were taxed at a rate of 20% or 40% and reckoned that low paid workers would be hit extremely hard.  I seek clarification from the Department on how it will administer the payment.  We are all well aware of the delays in administering any means-tested payment and Ms Madden is talking about means testing a large number of families.  She can give it whatever name she wishes, but it is means testing.  If we take farmers as an example, it is proposed to take into account farm holdings worth over &euro;750,000 for third level grant purposes.  Will that happen in the case of child benefit?  What about individuals with second homes?  It is always easy to administer measures for PAYE workers, but we need much more detail on the way this process will be administered.  I accept Ms Mangan has said it can be done, but will she tell us how it can be done and how long it will take to means-test every family in the country?  <\/p><p>  If time permits, I will contribute again.  I thank Ms Mangan who has many questions to answer, but that is the reason we are here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032000007#G00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1363786800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>We should have enough time for another round of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032000007#G00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363786800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I will start with Deputy Brendan Ryan's questions.

We are not saying it is sacrosanct.<\/p><p>  I draw the attention of members briefly to page 65 of the report on which we show other possible packages.  We do not provide a detailed analysis of the consequences of these packages, but we do show the numbers who would be affected and so on.  We have finished the report.  Unless we are asked by the Minister to revisit these issues, we will not be doing so, but there is no great difficulty in the Department of Social Protection making the relevant analysis if it is decided on principle to proceed with this proposal.<\/p><p>  On whether the savings should be targeted at child care services, I should have emphasised in my opening statement that we were looking exclusively at child income supports.  We were not looking at services.  However, we acknowledge the importance of services.  Everybody on the committee is very clear on their importance.<\/p> <p>On a personal level, were all the savings from child benefit to be targeted at child care or related measures, I would be extremely happy.  However, that is not for the advisory group to recommend because it is not what we were asked to do.  As I stated, everyone is highly conscious of the role services play in improving poverty outcomes.<\/p><p> In response to Senator Moloney regarding the make-up of the advisory group, it is composed in almost equal numbers of external experts and departmental representatives.  As the Senator noted, it did not - this obviously was the choice of the Minister and the Government - include any of the pressure groups.  However, we invited and received submissions from all the pressure groups.  My understanding was the idea was this would be purely an expert group in the sense that those involved would try to come up with a cold analysis of what was possible, without being involved in any particular lobbying for any particular area.  A number of the submissions we received from lobby groups and NGOs favoured the targeting of the pot, if you like, of payments towards the lower end of the scale.  However, I think a lot of pressure groups would find it difficult to find the point at which such targeting should occur, just as have we.  However, they played a significant role in sending in submissions, all of which were taken into account.<\/p><p> As the Senator correctly noted, the numbers receiving child benefit are 1.16 million and approximately 73,000 children, or rather their parents, receive family income supplement.  Consequently, there is no doubt but that child benefit is a much more important issue than is family income supplement.  One feature that I found to be quite alarming is that almost half of the children of this country are living in social welfare households.  Something like 47% or 48% are living in households that are receiving weekly social welfare payments.  While a few of these households, namely, those which are in receipt of insurance payments, might be adversely affected by the proposals suggested here, the vast bulk of them would not be affected by the proposals.  Perhaps the most worrying point is not that they would not be affected by the proposals but the current position whereby so many children are living in households that are dependent on social welfare.  The solution to this is not better or worse child income support payments but is employment and getting people off social welfare.  This is one of the greatest issues that must be addressed but again, our group was not tasked with looking at that particular issue.<\/p><p> I will leave it to the Department to answer in detail the question of how it will be administered.  As Ms Teresa Leonard fairly pointed out, it cannot be administered unless there is a decision by the Government to go ahead with it.  Nevertheless, I note that significant numbers of children are already in households receiving means tested qualified child increases.  They are already being means tested.  Moreover, farmers are already being means tested for farm assist and all sorts of other payments.  Consequently, means testing is not new or particularly difficult for the Department of Social Protection.  There may be some delays in respect of means testing some of the people but there is no particular difficulty about it.  For example, farm income in the Department of Social Protection's means test is entirely based on the actual income from the farm and not on the capital value of the assets or anything like that.  There is no suggestion in any of this that there would be any change to the manner in which the Department of Social Protection means tests people who are applying for benefits.  Moreover, the number of new people to be means tested under the system would not be as large as the number of beneficiaries would suggest because a highly significant number of them are already being means tested, for example, for disability allowance, jobseeker's allowance or whatever it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032000007#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Ita Mangan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363787400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I believe Ms Mangan stated it was 50%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032000008#H00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363787400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Almost 50%, I think it is 48%, are living in households that are getting a social welfare payment.

It is up to the Government to decide.  What we have done is preliminary work on the matter, given there are three basic areas that would require exploration when moving in this direction.  One I mentioned earlier pertains to policy issues, which include consideration of means testing and what would be part of a means-tested scheme.  As Ms Mangan pointed out, the parents of approximately 48% of children involved in child benefit are already in receipt of a means-tested payment and this issue would require examination.  I stress the point that this is just an initial view of the issue but I suggest those who may already be in receipt of payment from the Department would automatically have an entitlement to the second tier or within parameters.  Second, as for the other proportion of persons who would have a possible entitlement to the second tier, members should recall that I am talking in a vacuum here.  We would be obliged to put in place a method whereby we could collect data from them to assess their entitlement for the second tier.  In a personal rather than an official comment, I note that one of course would seek to put out information that would identify clearly to people whether they were not in the category.  The Senator herself noted it bothers her when she hears of people with bank sector incomes and so on.  Such people evidently would learn very quickly that they were not in the second tier and, consequently, I would expect not to be getting applications for second-tier payments from that category.  Consequently, by default, the numbers again would start to moderate back to a manageable piece within an income range.  We would be obliged to give consideration to building technologies to allow us to automate, as much as possible, that process.  Again, this is for a future decision and once such a decision was forthcoming, we would work at that particular area.<\/p><p>  That is roughly how we would do it and how we would manage the doing of it, but in addition there would be a requirement, should a decision be made by the Government, to introduce legislation to support this particular change.  There also would be a requirement on the Department to develop technology to support it because, as was identified earlier, we have had backlogs in particular areas about which we recently have done a lot of work to clear.  However, we do not wish to end up in a position where the introduction of a measure such as this had the consequence of parents suffering a further additional backlog.  Consequently, the Department would be obliged to do a lot of work.  I cannot give the finer details to the Senator because they do not exist at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032000008#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Leonard"},{"type":"speech","time":1363787400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Sweeney wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032000008#H00700","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363787400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>We played around with some of the key parameters and asked what if the threshold were &euro;30,000 and not &euro;25,000.

They are all illustrated in table 3 on page 66, which shows there is a large tranche of families who currently are in receipt of means tested social assistance, that is, 37% of all families, who will be untouched by whatever we do to the parameters.

The model we adopted as baseline adds a further 24% to the original 37% or, in other words, 37% of families already are being means tested for social assistance and because of the normative way the second tier is presented, one automatically would get another 24% of families, bringing us to 61% of all families in the State who would get some degree of the second tier.<\/p> <p>However, it could go up to 78% if the revenue buoyancy was there.

There has been case law to that effect before now concerning taxation decisions.  Did the advisory group consider the costs involved if cohabiting couples were to be taxed the same as married couples?  I tabled a parliamentary question about that recently and the Minister put a figure on it of &euro;1 million for every 1,000 couples if cohabiting couples were to be jointly taxed.  According to the census, however, there are around 168,000 cohabiting couples.  While not all of them would necessarily register as such, it could cost up to &euro;168 million to provide equal tax treatment for married and cohabiting couples.

I was not asking the witnesses to comment on what the Government does or does not do once it receives a report, other than confirming that there have been discussions since then.  In some ways, the budget changed everything in the report.  One of the promises or suggestions that the Minister made was that changes in child benefit would be ring-fenced to tackle child poverty.  It might have made it a bit more palatable if the money that was saved from child benefit in this year's budget cut had been redirected towards a qualified child allowance or the recognition of children under the family income supplement.  That would be a mechanism without creating a two-tier child income support system.  We already have such a system through child benefit, the qualified child increase and the family income supplement, without creating another payment.  We do not have that luxury.<\/p><p>  I am not necessarily asking the witnesses to comment because it is up to us to ask the Minister to examine a cost-neutral redistribution.  In that way, part of a payment could be shifted to specifically target child poverty.  The qualified child increase was introduced in the first place to identify those who are totally dependent on social welfare.  The family income supplement identified those who are classified as working poor.

He also made the point that when a fixed amount of income is being redistributed, there will be winners and losers.  I can understand that but surely we should be aspiring to an ideal whereby people at the top of the scale - the richer ones - should suffer most, while the poor should gain most.  I know that we cannot achieve perfection but, no matter what example is used, these recommendations fall a long way short of that.  A hell of a lot of poor people will lose quite substantially if those recommendations are implemented.  I do not care which figure is used but we should consider the examples.  A lone parent earning &euro;20,000 per year with one child and the lone parent's allowance will lose.  A married couple earning &euro;30,000 a year will also lose, as will somebody earning &euro;35,000 with one child.  I do not think anybody could describe a person earning &euro;35,000 a year gross, with one child, as being particularly well off.<\/p><p>  At the other end of the scale, one may take the example of a person earning &euro;60,000 while their partner earns &euro;40,000.  On a total income of &euro;100,000 they will lose &euro;1,140.

If I am an employee working the requisite number of hours and am in receipt of FIS, I will lose money but it does not make me any happier that somebody else who was not gaining it up to now will do so.  <\/p><p>  I have two questions for the departmental witnesses.  First, can they provide some other figures or examples and circularise them as quickly as possible?  Second, it was stated that the report will probably have to be implemented over two or three budgets, and I accept that.  However, if it will take so long to be implemented - and if it is the Government's intention to implement it - should they not start in the next budget in October?

The principle is very clear from the tax cases of the 1970s and 1980s.  It is not permissible for the Government to treat married couples less well than it treats unmarried couples.  That is the basic principle from which any consideration of the issue must start.  To put it into ordinary terms, the legal problem with the taxation of child benefit is as follows.  There is no point in trying to tax child benefit if it will not yield some results.  Let us consider the traditional situation, which, I accept, may not apply in all cases, where the father is out working and the mother is minding the children.  The mother is the recipient of the child benefit in all cases.  If she does not have any other source of income, she would not be liable for any tax on the child benefit and so introducing tax would not have any effect.  However, if she is married, her income can be ascribed to her husband and he can pay the tax on it.  If she is not married, that cannot be done.  So there is clearly scope for discriminating between married couples and cohabiting couples.<\/p><p>  When we are reviewing working age payments we will consider the issue of whether the tax system should be changed to tax cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples are taxed because the unit of assessment for tax purposes is one of the issues we need to review.  I am not familiar with the details of it yet because we have not yet examined it, but I recognise that it would cost some money to treat cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples are treated under the tax system.  I again refer back to the property tax, which will consider the joint income of cohabiting couples from the point of view of deferrals of the tax.  It is very unusual for the tax system to treat cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples, but that is one area in which it does so at present.  That can be reviewed - we have not yet considered it, but we will.<\/p><p>  I will ask Ms Teresa Leonard to address the issues on timing and phasing because she knows it better.  We have already said it would take about 18 months to implement this system fully.  The report also points out that the advisory group did not envisage all the elements of it would be introduced in one fell swoop.  Interestingly, savings in child benefit were made in the recent budget.  I am slightly hopping between questions here because Senator Moloney asked if we were given a budget within which to work.  The answer is that we were not, but our terms of reference very specifically provided that we would be cost neutral or cost reducing.  The package we analysed in detail is based on an assumption of &euro;200 million of savings.  The reason it is based on that assumption is not that we were told to find &euro;200 million worth of savings, but simply that we were trying to compare the two-tier system with the taxation system.  If everything could be taxed and if the issues over legality, etc., could be addressed, the taxation system would yield approximately &euro;300 million.  We were trying to compare like with like as far as possible.  I have to say we are talking about apples and oranges, but we were trying as far as possible to do that.  The example we have given involves savings of &euro;200 million from the 2012 expenditure rates.  Some of those savings have now been made by the reduction in child benefit in the recent budget.  In some ways, part of this is implemented, but the more difficult part is not implemented.<\/p><p>  I recognise that I am hopping between questions, but I am trying to keep some sequence in my head.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked whether we felt the savings in the recent budget should have been targeted at QCIs or FIS.  We were very clear that was not a good idea.  The problem with QCIs is not that they are not going to the less well off, which they are, but that they inherently create a disincentive to work.  Increasing QCIs further would further increase the disincentive to work.  As members will be aware from the ESRI studies, the disincentive to work does not arise for single people or possibly even for people with one child.  The disincentive to work in our system arises in the case of families with a number of children.  Transferring any of the child benefit amount into QCIs by definition disimproves the incentive to work and we were very conscious that this should not happen.  That is why we recommended instead of that having a second-tier payment which would not be contingent on receiving a social welfare payment, but would be there for those with low income.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Dea suggested that the rich should lose most.  Any reform of child benefit and the associated child income support payments can only take what they are getting so the maximum that can be taken from rich people is the child benefit amount they are getting and we are not in favour of removing the universal element.  As Dr. John Sweeney said earlier, we are not saying what the universal element should be, but we believe there should be some universal element.  The vast majority of children do not live in very rich households.  Some 80% of children live in households earning less than &euro;80,000.  More importantly 20% live in households earning under &euro;20,000.  Most of us who have had children deeply regret that we were not earning as much when we had them as we might have done in later life - that is just a life cycle reality.  The vast majority of children do not live in really rich households.  While of course a few do, the system should not be geared to the relatively few who live in very rich households.  Taxing child benefit would, of course, reduce the income for very rich households.  However, the maximum that can be taken from very rich households is whatever is taken off the basic child benefit because they are not getting the other benefits.<\/p><p>  On Deputy O'Dea's second question, I would love to do some other examples of processing all this, but I am afraid it is for the Minister and the Department to decide whether resources should be put into this.  It seems clear to me that resources should only be invested in further analysis if the principle is accepted that we move in that direction.  If the principle is accepted, clearly major work needs to be done on the different possible packages and their effects.  Before I ask Ms Leonard to address Deputy Ryan's questions about minimising hassle, etc., I ask Dr. Sweeney to make a few points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013032000010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ita Mangan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363788600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>If we were to use savings from child benefit to improve FIS, given that the withdrawal rate from FIS is high, there would be a disincentive to improve earnings.

Naturally, we have done preliminary work on this and broad outlines of what it would look like as a package should the Government make a decision to put it down.  We have indicated how much time it would take us to do this, to support it and, as Deputy Ryan put it, to put in place a system that would not cause too much difficulties.

I will begin by explaining what the Centre of Public Scrutiny is before going on to talk about some of the research I have been doing in the past few months on transparency in Britain and particularly England.<\/p><p>  The Centre for Public Scrutiny is a charity whose principal role is to promote the idea of good governance by considering accountability, transparency and the involvement of the public in decision-making.  Our main focus is on local government and we receive funding from the English Local Government Association to provide support and advice on governance to councils.  We also have a broader role and that is why I have been carrying out research on transparency in the light of recent changes in government policy on transparency and open data, which principally affect England.<\/p><p>  I will briefly provide a context for the policy environment on the other side of the Irish Sea.  The Freedom of Information Act applying in the UK was passed in 2000 and commenced in 2005.  The Government is considering making changes to that regime.  As part of that process the House of Commons justice committee carried out post-legislative scrutiny of the Freedom of Information Act earlier this year.  Part of my presentation today derives from the evidence I gave that committee.<\/p><p>  The main areas of change reflect the keenness of our current Government to move to increased openness through the proactive publication of more official data setting freedom of information within a broader regime of openness and government transparency.  Freedom of information is a reactive means of achieving that by providing information to members of the public when they ask for it.  The Government is trying to promote a more proactive approach whereby public institutions publish information as a matter of course.  New technology forms a principal means of making this work.  Open data and transparency do not necessarily lead to accountability.  We carried out research earlier this year to tackle that central issue and principle.<\/p><p>  I will go through some of the principal findings from that research.  I started by studying the stream of information and how the freedom of information provisions have been embedded in UK law and culture over the past five or ten years, and the wider context of transparency.  The first thing that needs to be done is to establish some aims and objectives for transparency.  Policy-makers often forget this on the assumption that transparency is inherently a good thing.  In light of the need for open-space policy-making more generally, we need to think about why transparency is a good thing in order to be able to judge whether the measures we put in place to promote and develop it are working.<\/p><p>  The constitution unit, which is part of University College London, took this approach when it carried out a very deep exercise in freedom of information in 2009.  I fed off that to establish some principles on transparency across the board.  I came up with four principal objectives, the first being to mitigate risk by opening up policy making.  The idea is that by opening up the policy-making process the assumptions of decision-makers about the impact and development of policy can be constructively challenged and potential risks can be reflected more accurately, and that by bringing different perspectives into policy-making one makes law and policy more accurately.  The second objective is increasingly important in the English and British contexts - that is, facilitating choice.  Increasingly in the UK we talk about using data to make it easier for the public to exercise choice in public services.  One of the principal areas in which this happening is the National Health Service.  We now have a system whereby when general practitioners refer people for treatment, they can choose the hospitals at which they will be treated.  The use of official information is important in ensuring that those people can exercise choice in an informed way.  The third objective is one of the more traditional reasons for regarding transparency as a good thing - that is, control of expenditure.  The idea is that publishing information adds value by coupling the publication of information with mechanisms for accountability, thereby minimising corruption.  Measuring value may have an impact on decisions.  Publication of financial and expenditure data can be used to establish whether a policy is generally achieving the ends it aims to achieve.  The fourth objective is the most obvious one - that is, promoting democracy through easy access to data and information and encouraging participation.  This is based on the idea that the public has a right to information about services provided on its behalf and about decisions made for it and by its elected representatives.  Those are the four principal objectives.<\/p><p>  The central point that I want to highlight from the research is the importance of culture, behaviour and values in making transparency work.  Consideration of freedom of information in England focuses mainly on response rates and the amount of time and resources involved in responding to FOI requests, because they are free, as are data protection requests.  There are two separate regimes in the UK, covered by separate Acts - one for official information and one for personal information.  The focus has always been on the process.  Consequently, many have viewed FOI as a compliance issue in respect of timescales, without thinking about why FOI and transparency are important.  I am trying to get to the bottom of the culture of transparency, encouraging the idea that we should be publishing more information because by doing so we achieve some of the objectives that I have set out, making policies and decisions better, and recognising that the publication of official information is not necessarily a one-way street by encouraging the public to respond with its interpretation of that data and additional data of its own, some of which is anecdotal.  By making the information fuller we make it more useful and effective.  People need to recognise the value they can bring to decision-making more generally.  That cultural and attitudinal aspect of transparency is often forgotten.<\/p><p>   I want to make a couple of points about issues that have come up in England with regard to criticisms of open data and the FOI regime.  The first involves context.  Often there are criticisms of FOI and measures to increase transparency more generally because it is felt that information is released without context and therefore people cannot effectively understand what data means.  In certain circumstances, that is quite correct.<\/p> <p>The issue is understanding that context is not just about requiring public servants to provide reams of explanatory data around official information, which of course is an additional resource requirement for them, it is about understanding that the public at large and official institutions can and should link data together to provide that context.  An increasing trend around the open data movement in the UK is the idea that data from a range of institutions can and should be linked together to provide an accurate and comprehensive picture of how service is delivered in an area.  Context can be dealt with in a way that is resource-neutral for public servants.<\/p><p> The second issue is the fact that publishing information is perceived to have a chilling effect on policy development, in particular at national  level.  The justice committee inquiring into this took evidence from a number of people who felt that freedom of information had had a chilling effect on the willingness of civil servants to provide accurate information to Ministers to allow them make decisions.  The idea was that poor decisions were being produced because civil servants might not, for some reason, want to produce frank advice which they felt if published later might embarrass Ministers.  Although this opinion has been expressed by many on this side of the water, it is not supported by the evidence and was not an argument accepted by the justice committee.  I am not sure if this is a concern or issue in Ireland but it is an issue that reflects the cultural challenge of transparency rather than structural issues around risks of transparency hindering effective policy developments.  This is not to suggest that there should not be a safe space for policy development that can happen in private, but that space should be quite small.  Perhaps I should pause as this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013032000004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Hammond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363788900,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Hammond.  Before inviting members of the committee to put their questions I would like to raise three particular issues.<\/p><p>  First, the committee is currently developing a proposal in the context of freedom of information which will take into account administrative aspects of the police force.  Has a similar approach been taken in the United Kingdom and how has that worked out?  Second, what would be the impact of further application of the Freedom of Information Act to semi-State companies, in the context in particular of competitor companies which are privately owned being able to acquire data that would be commercially sensitive to a semi-State company?  The third issue was raised by a member of the committee during its earlier discussion, namely, regulatory bodies, in particular airports and energy companies, which have acquired a status that allows them to make decisions that cause serious damage to customers.  It appears these bodies are operating in a secret world and the relevant peer Departments have long since given up trying to control them.  This phenomenon is, according to the member concerned, referred to as regulatory capture.  How do we ensure that regulators are appropriately held to account through the Freedom of Information Act?  Perhaps Mr. Hammond would offer his expertise and opinion on those issues. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013032000005#E00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363788900,"counter":175,"content":"<p>On policing, there are 43 police forces in England and Wales, all of which produce crime mapping data which allow people to interrogate information about crimes in their areas, including crime response and clear-up rates.  The issue with this is also one of context.  It is interesting that 18 months ago, when crime mapping were first published in England and Wales, there was an initial flurry of interest in it, in terms of people inquiring about crimes committed in their areas and so on.  However, public interest has dropped off dramatically since then because the information provided gives only a limited picture of services in local areas.  This comes back again to the issue of context and ensuring that the information provided is linked to other data which tell more about issues around crime across the whole public sector landscape, including community safety, crime prevention, probation and the justice system.  That is a complex issue.<\/p><p>  In terms of wider policing performance, it has been usual for some time for policing performance issues to be discussed in public.  Up to recently, policing in England and Wales was controlled by police authorities, which were bodies on which local authority members sat.  They met in public to examine issues such as police performance and published findings and reports.  They also scrutinised the police service and priorities.  That system has since changed to one of elected police and crime commissioners, the purpose of which is to improve accountability and transparency.  This highlights the issue that many of the transparency and open data issues in policing sit outside of the FOI regime.  I am not aware in detail of the particular ways in which police forces respond to and deal with FOI requests.  While they are subject in general terms to FOI, in many instances freedom of information requests on specific issues are not responded to, including on operational policing in respect of which the release of information would result in individuals being identified, which information is protected by the data protection regime.  FOI requests to the police forces are limited to strategic and tactical information about policing rather than specific or operational issues.<\/p><p>  On the question of freedom of information and commercial sensitivity-confidentiality, this is a significant issue which has been raised in this country in the past few years as more and more services hitherto delivered by local authorities or other public institutions and have been contracted out to private companies.  The question that arises is whether those firms should be subject to FOI.  The conclusion is that they should not be.  There was a proposal that revisions would be made to the FOI regime to make such organisations subject to FOI in this country.  However, the perception is that the Government is pulling back from this approach.  It tends to be the case that contracts between public bodies and private sector companies include provisions around transparency, openness and accountability.  By definition, and because there is no nationally accepted scheme for doing this, those arrangements end up being quite <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  This means one must rely on the contract management of those regimes and systems to ensure that information gets out, which sometimes happens and other times does not.  It is a challenge.  The argument being made about commercial confidentiality being an enormous barrier to FOI is not well made.  There are ways and means of preserving commercial confidentiality around procurement and tendering processes, where confidentiality is required.  The issue that arises is separating that from service delivery, where there is no justification for commercial confidentiality other than in very limited circumstances.  There should be an expectation from private sector organisations providing a public service that they should be held to the standards of transparency and accountability demanded of public services which historically would have delivered those services.<\/p> <p> The third point concerned the role of regulatory bodies.  In this country we deal with that in a slightly formal way as, in part, Departments produce what are called accountability system statements.  They have been produced for a time.  The permanent secretary, or senior civil servant, in each Department is required to produce a statement setting out where accountability sits within that Department, with the different regulatory bodies and quangos or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations and executive agencies that sit under the Department.  It is identifying where accountability and responsibilities lie while ensuring there is a system of exerting control over those bodies.  The Government has been quite aggressively seeking to take much more control of the work which hitherto was carried out by regulatory bodies and executive agencies, which continue to have in some instances a significant amount of freedom.  In many cases those responsibilities have been taken back into parent Departments, whereas in some instances the body has been abolished entirely, and the responsibilities simply are not carried out any more.<\/p><p> In more general terms, there is a certain reliance on those regulatory bodies adopting a transparent and open approach.  There has been much flux in the past couple of years in what regulatory bodies are responsible for, how they work, who sits on boards and how they publish information.  The British Government has been pushing for regulators and inspectors to be much more open about the way in which they operate, and we are beginning to see that happen more now through the likes of Ministers exerting direct control, agreements around funding and political influence.  We are still in a state of flux but those issues highlighted have been identified as a concern, particularly bodies not having effective oversight.  The systems I mentioned have been implemented and strengthened in trying to make this oversight more effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013032000005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Hammond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363789500,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I appreciate Mr. Hammond speaking to us today and I would like some observations on one or two specific points.  Will the witness comment on fees?  Currently, there is no fee attached if people make a request for their own information.  There is a fee for non-personal information, with an additional fee charged by some Government bodies where it is felt there is a substantial cost for providing the information.  That is called a retrieval fee.  Does Mr. Hammond have a comment on those issues or an indication of the level of fees applying for a freedom of information request?<\/p><p>  Has the use of freedom of information risen or fallen in recent years with more availability of information through modern technology?  Even organisations under the freedom of information umbrella in Ireland have a number of exemptions, and there may be a similar process in Britain.  In various pieces of legislation, certain items are exempt from disclosure even as people assume that everything in a Department is subject to the freedom of information process.  When new bodies or state organisations or boards are formulated in England, do they come under the freedom of information umbrella from their initiation?  The policy in Ireland has been not to burden a new organisation with freedom of information responsibilities and to let them bed in for a year or two before reviewing the position.  That may be a decade later.  Is there a general view on that issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013032000006#F00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363789500,"counter":178,"content":"<p>There has never been a fee regime in Britain for freedom of information requests, and they have been free on demand since the outset, regardless of cost.  The British Government was toying with the idea of introducing fees and the justice committee investigation came out relatively strongly against that as an approach.  As one would expect, many witnesses were against the idea.  Interestingly, there is something of a movement for fees from central Departments and less so from local government, which may be surprising.  There is not a significant impetus for introducing fees, partially because the benefits are marginal.  The argument is that with the amount it costs to establish a system of fees and to collect fees, as the amount charged to individuals is so low, it would not be especially cost-effective to do so.  There may be different evidence in Ireland but as we have never had a fee system here, the basis is mainly on guess work.  That is the assumption being followed anyway.<\/p><p>  The idea against fees is more philosophical rather than anything else.  The argument is that this data is public and the justification for a fees regime is difficult to support.  Arguably, the fee may be to cut the cost but part of the duty of a public body or organisation should be to respond to requests for information from the public, recognising that the public has a stake in that organisation as citizens.  This is ultimately about the relationship between citizens and states and not having a fees regime in place encourages people to use freedom of information to find out more about services that they may wish to know about and there is no cap arising because only people with significant resources might be prepared to make a freedom of information request.  It could be claimed that such a cap puts power into the hands of people with more economic advantages.<\/p><p>  There have not been any enormous trends up or down in the use of the freedom of information process.  Use has consistently been relatively high since the freedom of information process began in 2005.  There are still issues with vexatious and persistent requests to some public bodies and there is still the matter of the press using freedom of information for \"fishing\" exercises.  As there is no charges regime, the press can submit freedom of information requests to every local authority in the country to query an issue, hoping that something newsworthy will come from the information.  That is part of the price to be paid for having a democracy.<\/p><p>  Volume is significant and some people in Britain have raised concerns about the volume of freedom of information requests.  The way to get around this is to publish more information proactively, and the more this is done in a useful and intelligent way, the less people will automatically need to approach freedom of information as the first means of acquiring information about how a public body operates.  Councils and other institutions public much information about themselves proactively but often it is not very easily understood by people and can be difficult to access.  The ease of access problem is one of the reasons freedom of information is well used, and as we move to a more intelligent approach to open data, I hope people's need to revert to freedom of information requests as a default will reduce.  That may be idealistic.<\/p><p>  There are two principal forms of exception under the Freedom of Information Act here.  There are absolute exceptions for national security and there are also qualified exceptions.  A public body must carry out a public interest test to establish whether information should be released when it could be covered by a qualified exception.<\/p> <p>There has been much debate about that public interest test.  There is no official definition provided for what public interest is, although the Information Commissioner has published a guidance on the public interest test and how it should operate.  It sets out the basic principles that would constitute the public interest, which I believe still stand.  In a guidance produced in 2007 the Information Commissioner listed a number of public interest factors, which included furthering the understanding of and participation in the public debate on issues of the day, promoting accountability and transparency, promoting accountability and transparency in spending and those types of general issues.  That is what we talk about when we refer to the public interest.  The public interest test should be interpreted quite broadly.  Decision makers have to recognise that this is about public interest with a presumption that openness is better than non-disclosure, rather than public interest being the same as what is the interest of the organisation itself.  The two do not necessarily coincide.  How the public interest test operates has been one of the principal issues surrounding appeals to the Information Commissioner.  I know there is a similar regime operating in Ireland's current and proposed freedom of information, FOI, system.<\/p><p> The fourth question was about using FOI from the inception and creation of new public bodies.  That is an interesting point.  It is not one that has been raised.  We just make the assumption generally that when those bodies are established they will immediately be subject to freedom of information.  It is part of the governing systems that one would expect a new public body to establish from the first day.  One is establishing decision making systems, ways to deliver services on the ground, one is setting up the internal management processes and as part of that one sets up the FOI processes.  As a case in point, from 1 April next there will be an entirely new structure for heart services operating in England.  A new range of different health bodies will be established, with an odd one to be abolished.  From 1 April those new bodies will be subject to FOI.  I do not believe anybody has ever suggested or proposed that there be some type of lead-in.  It is an interesting idea, but if one wants to have FOI and transparency as integral to the way that organisations make decisions, it is quite difficult to say that one must have all the other systems set up from the first day because they are business critical but FOI is a bit on the side or an extra thing which is not quite so important.  It sends the wrong message.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013032000006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Hammond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363790100,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hammond.

The former Cabinet Secretary, Sir Gus O'Donnell, the senior pre-eminent civil servant in the country has cast some aspersions on the Freedom of Information Act.

Again, one could be charitable about that and say that looking at a government from the inside, as he does, he will see the shortcomings that perhaps freedom of information has in terms of speed in decision making and the fact that it can throw spanners in the works.  Equally, one can could say that could be an example of somebody who is not signed up generally to the principles of transparency and does not really understand what transparency as a broader concept can bring to decision making, but instead looks at FOI purely as a procedural issue whereby people are sending in requests, those requests must be processed and it is additional work.  It is FOI sitting in a separate box which will stop what one must do.  One is not using the benefit and the lessons one learns through that process to influence one's wider work.

What the witness said about Tony Blair inclines me to say that we should adopt the UK model lock, stock and barrel.  Mr. Hammond is very much in favour of freedom of information, more transparency and more accountability and he says the model in the UK is generally quite good.  Will he indicate a few areas where he believes it could be improved even further?  Mr. Hammond appeared to hint in that direction.  He said a key aspect was not just being reactive or having a system that is reactive but having one that is proactive, which is about getting good information published and getting it out to the public in an accessible and understandable form for ordinary people.  I agree with that.  However, Mr. Hammond also spoke about opening up the decision making process.  I thoroughly agree with him.  Part of the reason people are often so alienated from state administration is that they feel decisions were made before they had a chance to scrutinise them or to be consulted on them.  Will Mr. Hammond speak about how that works and how opening up the consultation process is or is not working in the UK, where it might be improved and what we could learn from his experience and views on that?<\/p><p>  I also have a question on the issue of commercial sensitivity.  Mr. Hammond dismissed the concerns in that area.  In Ireland, I believe there is a widespread concern about the difficulty in getting information from semi-State bodies, State agencies and State boards and in cases where services are contracted out.  Mr. Hammond appeared to think that was not a big issue.  It is certainly a big concern for us.  It is not just State agencies.  We also had a discussion here about bodies that receive substantial money from the Exchequer, such as not-for-profit organisations or banks that are private entities but which have received huge amounts of money from the taxpayer, and whether freedom of information should extend to them and having transparency and accountability in that regard.<\/p><p>  There is also the asylum, immigration and deportation process.  We have received testimony from asylum seekers and organisations representing refugees that there is a veil of secrecy around this area, it is very difficult to get information and that we must be specific in opening up this area.  Will Mr. Hammond comment on that?<\/p><p>  Finally, there is the issue of fees.  Mr. Hammond said that the vexatious complaints, the costs and so forth have been raised in the UK.  This has certainly been raised over here.  Will he give us a little more information on why this should not be an obstacle to extending freedom of information as far as possible?  Even though vexatious requests are obviously a phenomenon, it is not such a burden that it makes public administration unworkable.  Is that what I should take from what Mr. Hammond said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013032000007#G00600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363790100,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Yes.  On the question of improvements, one matter that is often raised is the fact that the Act requires public bodies to produce what is called a publication scheme setting out what documents and other items they publish as a matter of course.  I do not think the publication scheme has worked as anticipated.  Organisations do not regularly update their publication schemes in some instances.  I suspect that many have not updated them since 2005.<\/p> <p>The creation of publication schemes is a slightly formalised process.  As it is a separate requirement for organisations, it is something they do not necessarily take seriously.  Many freedom of information requests to public bodies can often be requests for information already covered under the publication scheme.  This suggests the publication scheme is not automatically the first port of call.  The principal improvement to the structure would be revisiting the publication scheme to use it to divert run of the mill requests to reduce the burden on public bodies.<\/p><p> The question of how we do this is probably slightly above my pay grade.  It is a difficult issue and there is a public education aspect to it.  There is also an issue about prior activity which leads on to the second improvement.  The most significant improvement would involve a process that is less structured.  It is about getting public servants and elected officials to realise that freedom of information legislation sits as part of a wider landscape of transparency and accountability.  When there is that understanding, one will get more people taking a slightly more nuanced approach to freedom of information requests, seeing it less of a bureaucratic burden and understanding the issues the public might have with given services and requests.  This would mean freedom of information requests would be used to influence decisions made in the future and how information is published.<\/p><p> Much of the work has been about publishing data and information in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>way.  An example is the requirement imposed on local authorities in England to publish all expenditure information on any budget lines above &pound;500.  On the face of it, it looks like a robust means of ensuring local accountability and transparency.  However, it is not because all that happens is that the local authorities publish big spreadsheets every month which set out the amounts spent on various items but tell nothing more about the services provided or their impact.  That information given in isolation is worse than useless because it encourages us to be complacent, thinking that because the information is published we are, therefore, transparent when that is not the case.  It is about culture.  Opening up is as much about linking data as it is about publishing more data.  There is a lot of data, but the challenge is about linking it to make it more useful and highlight interesting conclusions.<\/p><p> On the point about commercial sensitivity, I accept that there will be parts of relationships between public and private bodies where commercial sensitivity will need to be maintained.  One will still need that privacy to allow the formal exercise around negotiations to happen.  I understand why private bodies would not want that kind of information published because there are issues to do with intellectual property, competitive bids and ensuring value for money.  If one is publishing all bids for services, it will mean the market will be skewed.  The market can only be affected in that context if one has a sealed and closed process.  However, there are other opportunities beyond to open up the process.  There can be full transparency in contracting.  It is not unusual any more for this not to happen.  As a matter of course, public bodies will publish contract-monitoring information.  This comes back to my idea of ensuring control of management accountability for decisions reached.  People at the top of public bodies want to ensure services delivered by contractors are delivered effectively.  They will want to draw that information into themselves and, as a matter of course, when they hold it themselves, it can be subject to freedom of information legislation.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, the point about asylum is somewhat beyond my purview.  I do not feel confident to deal with it, other than I will reiterate some of my points on policing around the publication of strategic information on deportations, asylum cases and backlogs.  We have had issues in the United Kingdom about lengthy waiting times in dealing with asylum cases.  However, I do not know enough about the issue to comment on it.<\/p><p> On fees and vexatious requests, the issue is understanding what makes a vexatious request vexatious.  We should not be conflating a vexatious request with one that is a little difficult, annoying, embarrassing or persistent.  For example, one cannot have a vexatious requester.  The Commons justice committee examined how someone who made a lot of freedom of application requests could be classified as a vexatious requester.  That is a point we strongly argue against.  Just because someone makes a lot of requests does not necessarily mean they are not valid or valuable.  Just because a person may have made a vexatious request once before does not mean future requests will be vexatious.  The example of a vexatious request often given here is the freedom of information request to all councils from a newspaper asking how much they spent on biscuits.  On the face of it, one can say it is a vexatious request, clearly designed as a stupid request to take up time and effort.  However, there is also a valid request about expenditure on hospitality services.  Vexatious is a high bar.  One has to look at it from the requester's point of view.  There is a need for this information.  It is about a presumption in favour of openness.  That is one of the benefits of the information regime.  The information commissioner has been quite forthright for several years in appeals and introduced a high bar for determining what is a vexatious request.  There is no evidence to suggest public bodies will be overwhelmed by a colossal number of vexatious requests.  There will be requests that will be annoying, difficult and embarrassing.  However, that is not vexatious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013032000007#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Hammond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363790700,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I would like to wrap up by returning to a couple of points.  I found the latter part of Mr. Hammond's contribution very interesting.  Representatives of the National Union of Journalists appeared before the committee earlier to discuss this module and had their own observations to make.  It would be very much associated with a campaign to loosen up, or broaden, aspects of the Freedom of Information Act.  One of the proposals at which we looked was the concept of a register user fee, in order that one could have accredited or non-accredited or associated or non-associated journalists who might be freelancers able to operate under one umbrella to engage with the freedom of information service.<\/p><p>  To return to Mr. Hammond's biscuit comment, it must be acknowledged that, at times, the media engage with the Freedom of Information Act for commercial purposes.  It is not always about extrapolating information and asking questions about how many biscuits have been bought in the borough of Manchester or Liverpool.  It might make an interesting headline on the front page of a newspaper tomorrow morning, but is it really serving the public interest and should local authorities charge for finding the information?<\/p> <p>Ultimately, as has been the case in Ireland, the paradox of the freedom of information debate among the media is if we were to drop all the barriers to allow the media to get information they want, it would create a strange environment because much exclusive commentary in print or broadcast media comes from freedom of information requests that allow journalists and newspapers to get the jump on one another.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013032000008#HH00200","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363791300,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Lots of journalists could be sacked and people could just use civil servants to get information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013032000009#JJ00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1363791300,"counter":190,"content":"<p>There is a commercial aspect for the media.

The print media want to sell newspapers.  There is an issue of journalists going on wide-ranging fishing exercises, although in my opinion it is over-played.  It is difficult to see how to police a dual track regime because if we say a journalist should adopt a different process from a private individual, the obvious way around that is to make the FOI request as a private individual.  The practical circumstances would make that practically unworkable.<\/p><p>  Some have suggested press organisations pay a levy on the assumption they will make freedom of information requests but I do not see how that can be practically operated and how it would be possible to classify where an organisation should have to pay money for information and where it should not.  One of the benefits of the British regime is the simplicity and because there are no charges, those tricky hard cases do not need to be decided because the system is blind to whomever is making the request.  That is a fundamental principle of the Freedom of Information Act.  It is irrelevant and it is frowned upon to ask why a person might want information.  The fact the information is requested is the only thing that is relevant.  Requestor blindness is one of the fundamental aspects of the British Act and that is jealously guarded.  The ICO has produced some robust guidance on this.<\/p><p>  It comes back to the philosophical issue I talked about earlier.  These are public data that have been created and developed on behalf of the public using public money and therefore it should be produced in the public domain as far as possible.  It is going to produce difficulties, and be arguably more expensive, for some public institutions to publish information on request in this way than would be the case if they did not do it.  If it ultimately helped to make decision making more effective, however, and if it is coupled with effective accountability mechanisms, that is the critical factor.  If it helps to open up participation in decision making and to achieve the objectives I set out at the beginning, it is worth it.  It is about recognising the externalities and not looking at FOI requests as being a cost in a box somewhere.  We must say that as public bodies, we are paying a cost to manage FOI requests but we get a benefit in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in being open and allowing people to work with us and co-produce public decisions and policy.  By doing that, the decisions are more effective and offer more value for money.<\/p><p>  It is a <i>quid pro quo<\/i> and the press are an integral part of that challenge.  Some of the material they produce will be daft and borderline vexatious but much of their work is about genuine robust public challenge.  By trying to mitigate the more frivolous stuff, there might be a risk of missing some of the more serious material.  On balance, it is not worth the effort to develop a complicated regime to separate things out; that is the conclusion some of the British advocates have arrived at.  I cannot speak for the ICO or other experts but I think that broadly accords with their views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013032000009#JJ00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Hammond"},{"type":"speech","time":1363791300,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hammond for briefing us and for the lively discussion we had, which certainly added to our understanding.

Britain has substantial experience of this area spanning more than 38 years.  Overall, I welcome the Bill.  It is a step in the right direction, particularly in assisting the rehabilitation process for people who have been convicted, served sentences and paid their debt to society.  In Britain, the period considered spent was 30 months at one stage and that has been increased to 48 months, which provides more scope.<\/p><p>  I wish to read into the record the relevant sections of a case study by the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  It is the case study of an individual called Liam.  He received a six-year sentence with the final two years suspended.  He completed his leaving certificate in prison along with various other courses and upon release he successfully completed the Trinity Access programme and a degree in social science in NUI Maynooth, following which he did a postgraduate diploma in adult and community education.  He is now qualified to teach various courses, as recognised by the Teaching Council.  That is just one example of an individual who would be ruled out under what is proposed in the legislation, as would many more like him.  Those are people who have genuinely rehabilitated themselves and are success stories, but they will be excluded under what is proposed in the legislation. <\/p><p>  I note also that the Irish Penal Reform Trust, which we would all respect as an advocate for change and with which the committee has worked on our penal reform recommendations, which will be launched soon, recommends that we consider a period of 48 months in this respect.  That is the context for my amendment.  I trust the Minister of State will consider accepting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013032000002#A00600","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1363788000,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Collins wish to contribute on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013032000002#A00700","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1363788000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Will I speak on my amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013032000002#A00800","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1363788000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013032000002#A00900","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1363788000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>The argument to be made for the inclusion of our amendment is the same as that articulated by Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  We have been informed on it by some of the deliberations and commentary of the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  We did not go quite as far as proposing a period of 48 months.  We propose to substitute the period of 12 months with two years to allow for greater flexibility.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn alluded to a case study.  As I said on Second Stage, the general thrust of the legislation is very much welcomed.  I attended Limerick Institute of Technology recently and heard from a number of students who are finding it difficult to get placements by virtue of the fact that they have previous minor convictions on their record.  Obtaining Garda clearance and all that goes with it is proving to be an obstacle to them.  The period of 12 months is a little restrictive.  If the Minister of State is minded to extend the period to two years that would be great, or if he wants to go along with Deputy Mac Lochlainn's proposal to extend the period to 48 months, I would withdraw my amendment on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013032000002#A01000","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1363788000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their support for the Bill.  There is a cross-party perspective regarding the Bill and that is welcome.  We have given the amendments proposed by both Deputies a good deal of consideration.  As the members will be aware, the law in England and Wales has been amended recently to provided that sentences up to four years are covered by their Rehabilitation of Offenders Act.  Some say that this should be the benchmark by which we should devise our own scheme.  The Deputies have settled on a period of two years and four years, respectively.  It is worth saying that the English and Welsh legislation, which does not apply in Northern Ireland, is now probably the most liberal in the common law world.  Meanwhile what we are proposing, when compared with Australia and New Zealand, is at the more liberal end of the spectrum.  In most Australian states only prison sentences of six months or less are covered while in New Zealand no one who is sentenced to imprisonment can benefit from their corresponding legislation.  In Northern Ireland where sentences of up to 30 months are covered, the rehabilitation period for a six months sentence is seven years from the end of the sentence, as against four years from the date of conviction provided under the Bill.<\/p><p>  It is worth recalling also that the genesis of this legislation was the highly regarded Law Reform Commission report on spent convictions, which we all have seen.  That report recommended only sentences of six months or less should be covered.  <\/p><p>  In preparing the legislation the Government decided to go the extra mile and cover sentences of up to 12 months.  In that respect, the Government is going further.  The 12 month cut-off covers more than 85% of all custodial sentences handed down by the courts in Ireland.  By any yardstick, a regime that allows a proportion of custodial sentences to become spent, as in this case, is generous.  The 12-month cut-off aligns the regime with the sentencing jurisdiction of the District Court where summary offences are prosecuted.  <\/p><p>  There will always be opinions on the cut-off point, whether it be 12 months, 24 months or 48 months.  From a Government perspective, we are definitely going to stick with a 12-month cut-off.  Having spoken to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and discussed the matter at length, we will revisit this in the coming years and see how it is working.  After a number of years we may return to it having regard to some of the suggestions that have been made, but we have to start off somewhere.  Given the fact that the cut-off point we propose covers the percentage of convictions that I mentioned, a 12-month cut-off point is appropriate at this time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013032000002#A01100","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1363788000,"counter":210,"content":"<p>While the Bill is welcome, the challenge in the legislation is to find proportionality between the need to rehabilitate a person and the need to protect citizens and vulnerable people, employers and employees.  I gave a particular case study of a person who has made a huge effort in education over a sustained period and has not only repaid his debt to society but has actively sought to do more than that.  We have to strike that balance.<\/p><p>  I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the case of Cox <i>v.<\/i> Ireland which went to the Supreme Court.  The court ruled that section 34 of the Offences against the State Act 1939, which applied to public servants, was too broad and discriminated against those affected.  In this legislation the Minister of State and the Department of Justice and Equality should be mindful that wherever they set the level, it must be balanced with the right of the citizen who has rehabilitated himself or herself in a demonstrable way to have a chance to return and actively participate.  This concerns the whole area of employment rights - that the person's rights to work, to a pension and in other issues are not affected.  I accept the Minister of State has made clear he will not go beyond 12 months but I appeal to him to engage with the Minister after today's meeting to see if he is entirely satisfied that what he suggests is in compliance with Article 40.3 of the Constitution, namely, the right to work or earn a livelihood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013032000003#B00100","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1363788000,"counter":211,"content":"<p>That is noted.

The line drawn is as per the two-conviction limit and is based on the premise that people deserve a second or third chance.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, introduced an amendment in the Seanad that will allow a person with a number of convictions to have them all deemed spent, provided they relate to two incidents.  The people we are trying to assist are genuine, something I believe all of us in this room accept, and are not career criminals.  Few people would suggest that the scheme should be opened further and I do not believe anybody present is suggesting that.

They want to move on and have no intention of coming to the attention of the authorities again.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's amendment would provide no deterrence to criminality but instead would hold out the prospect that no matter how often a person offends, a day will come in the future when his or her convictions will be spent.

As members are probably aware, the committee has already heard the views of the Office for Internet Safety and Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and has held meetings attended by representatives of the social media networks Facebook and Twitter.  We have also met the National Anti-Bullying Coalition and will hear from Digital Rights Ireland later this morning.  In addition, we are taking submissions in writing via social media channels from interested groups and individuals.

I am accompanied by Ms Sabine Frank from our Berlin office, who is our expert on digital literacy.  We have divided our presentation into three main parts, the first being the benefits of the Internet and social media platforms.  I will then give a brief overview of what YouTube is doing to ensure people stay safe and secure online and I will offer a couple of thoughts on where we think we can all work together in this area.<\/p><p>  Before I begin, I will give the committee a quick introduction to Google Ireland.  Google celebrates ten years in Ireland this year.  During the course of that time we have grown from five Googlers in 2003 to more than 2,500 Googlers today.  Our recent investment of almost &euro;300 million in our headquarter buildings just down the road in Barrow Street as well as our new data centre in west Dublin has consolidated our long-term commitment to Ireland and will be the basis for future growth and expansion.  Much of the work we do from Dublin focuses on helping companies, big and small, to get the most out of the new business models and new opportunities presented by the Internet.  I will detail precisely what those new values are.<\/p><p>  In the past decade the innovations brought about by the Internet have revolutionised communications and the spread of information across the globe.  The Internet has been a phenomenal force for good, promoting culture, boosting economic growth and advancing free expression.  Social media platforms such as YouTube have been at the heart of the Internet's success in generating economic value, creating employment and fostering innovation and creativity.  <\/p><p>  What is YouTube?  For those who are not familiar with it, YouTube is our user-generated video-sharing platform, around which users debate, form communities, interact with and inspire one another.  YouTube began in our founder Chad Hurley's garage in California in 2005, when he posted the very first video of his friends at the zoo.  The following year, Google acquired YouTube, and since then the platform has enjoyed enormous success, becoming the world's biggest video-sharing platform today.  The slide on the screen will give the committee a quick snapshot of the story of YouTube and some sense of the scale of content we are dealing with.  Seventy-two hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and there are 4 billion views on YouTube every day.  In 2011, we had more than a trillion views on the platform, which equates to about 140 views for every person on the planet.  YouTube has enabled creativity and collaboration on an unprecedented scale, allowing the young, the young at heart and the old to engage with communities both locally and globally, to express themselves and to get involved in society.  For example, on YouTube today one can submit an idea for a science experiment to Stephen Hawking.  One can launch one's music career, as Justin Bieber did, or start a business from one's bedroom.  Cork man Jason Sullivan began uploading cartoons last year to YouTube and after phenomenal success on the platform, Sminky Animation, as shown on the screen, has gone on to sign a contract with United Agents in London.   The Khan Academy, with which many members may be familiar, has pulled together more than 3,000 educational videos on YouTube, with students around the world viewing up to 200,000 videos every day on topics ranging from calculus to arithmetic and from prehistoric Africa to the Second World War.  During the past weekend, members may have seen how RTE used the platform to promote Ireland at home and abroad.  It live-streamed two main events: the full St. Patrick's Day parade, and, as part of The Gathering, a one-hour music stream from &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, which showcased a host of Irish talent from Christy Moore to the Frames to the Script.<\/p><p>  As with any means of communication, there can be challenges.  I am aware that the committee has discussed at recent hearings how social media platforms reflect older and larger societal problems with regard to how we treat one another.  In order to address these societal problems we believe we need societal solutions, but we also believe that technology and technology companies have a role to play in ensuring they keep their users safe online.  <\/p><p>  I turn now to how YouTube is playing its part.  There are three pillars to our approach to user safety at YouTube and, more generally, at Google - education, empowerment and protection.  At YouTube we are deeply committed to educating young people about how to use the Internet safely and responsibly and to raising awareness about digital citizenship and digital literacy.  I shall take members through a couple of the campaigns that are particularly relevant to the committee's current work.  The first is the digital citizenship curriculum.  We launched an online curriculum for YouTube last year aimed at supporting teachers of second-level students by providing online teaching plans and lesson plans.  The curriculum educates students on YouTube's policies, how to keep themselves safe online and how to report abusive content, in order that they can develop a holistic understanding of how to be a responsible digital citizen.  The curriculum was first tested in the Ursuline convent in Waterford, where our local YouTube team walked through the lesson plans with four transition year students and their teachers and used their feedback to improve and adapt the programme.  Since then the digital citizenship curriculum has been launched globally.  <\/p><p>  The second project, It Gets Better, was created to show young lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teenagers how successful, fulfilled and happy their lives will be if they can get through their difficult teenage years and to show them they are not alone during those years.<\/p> <p>YouTube has worked closely with It Gets Better to highlight issues of bullying facing young LGBT teenagers and provide them with messages of support and encouragement.  It Gets Better has become a worldwide movement, with more than 10,000 uplifting personal videos from celebrities, world leaders and everyday people.  In the current slide, President Obama is seen in a photograph addressing a young gay soldier in Iraq.  Messages have also been posted from young out people up and down the country.  These videos provide a message of support and solidarity to young LGBT teenagers and are a further example of how our platform is being used for good.<\/p><p> Google has been a significant supporter of the Family Online Safety Institute, or FOSI, a project of A Platform for Good which is designed to help parents, teachers and students to connect, share and do good online.  FOSI is an international not-for-profit organisation that convenes leaders in government, industry and the NGO sector to formulate new solutions and policies in online safety.  We will launch FOSI's European chapter at our Dublin headquarters on Barrow Street in May and would be delighted to have members of the committee attend to learn more about the work FOSI is doing and its plans for Europe.<\/p><p> In addition to education and awareness-raising on responsible digital citizenship, YouTube has a responsibility to ensure its users have the tools they need to stay safe online.  The second pillar of our approach is empowerment.  I mentioned at the outset that YouTube is a video-sharing platform made up of and for our users.  As it is a community, we have developed community guidelines which set out the rules for being on YouTube.  The community guidelines set out what behaviours are not allowed on YouTube, including bullying, harassment and hate speech.<\/p><p> There are two processes that are most relevant to the issue currently being considered by the committee.  I said earlier that 72 hours of video are uploaded to the platform every minute.  This amounts to hundreds of thousands of videos every day.  To manage that much content, we have developed a community policing system which involves our users helping us to enforce the rules on YouTube.  The way this works is that the community flags content that is believed to break the rules.  Every day, thousands of YouTube users flag potential violations in this way.  The mechanism is straightforward and easily navigable by users of all ages.  I will talk the committee through what happens when a user sees someone being bullied on YouTube.  On the slide being shown now, members will see that there is a flag under every video on YouTube.  If I want to report a video, I hit the flag, which triggers a drop-down menu of options.  I select &quot;Hateful or abusive content&quot;, click &quot;Bullying&quot;, and my report is sent to the YouTube policy enforcement team for review.  There are a number of other categories in the drop-down menu which help users to identify the behaviours that are banned on the platform.  There is also an option to include additional information about a video, including what is in it, who is involved and a time stamp.  Reported videos are notified to the policy enforcement team and promptly reviewed to establish whether they break our rules.  There are sanctions where rules are broken.  Users who repeatedly violate our terms of service will have their accounts terminated, while those who upload particularly egregious content will have their accounts terminated immediately.<\/p><p> The flagging mechanism is also a great way for us to listen to users to enable us to continuously improve our products and services.  On the basis of recent user feedback, we have added a flag that allows users to highlight threats of suicide or self-injury.  If we receive such a video, we immediately escalate it to law enforcement where the threat is actionable or we believe there is a potential for immediate harm.  If a threat is too vague to escalate to law enforcement, we can get in touch with the person who uploaded the video to provide him or her with resources on suicide and self-injury prevention to help the person to start to get the help he or she needs.  In addition to the flagging options, we have an easy-to-use reporting tool at <i>youtube.ie\/reportabuse<\/i>to report comments and videos more generally.<\/p><p> A second way we empower users is by providing them with the tools to control how and with whom they interact online.  We provide our users with full control over their videos and the comments made on them.  As a user, one has a number of options available.  The first option is private sharing.  If a user wants to limit the exposure of a video, he or she sets it to private.  When a video is set to private, only the person who posts the video and those he or she invites can see it.  The video does not turn up in search results or on playlists.  A further option is to block a specific user.  If one chooses to block a specific user, that user cannot comment on a video or contact one privately in any way.  One can also control the comments made on one's videos.  There are three main options in this regard.  One is to approve all comments automatically and allow them to appear below the video; another is to allow comments only after approval; and the last is to disable comments altogether so that no comments appear below a video.  The person who posts a video has ultimate control over the video, the comments made and who gets to see it in the first place.<\/p><p> The last strand of our approach is protection.  Google has invested heavily in technologies that protect users against bad actors on the Internet.  We have a dedicated website, <i>google.ie\/goodtoknow\/<\/i>, which educates all users about protecting themselves online.  The Good to Know website provides families with helpful tips and advice on how users can protect themselves against identity theft, malware, fraudsters and online scams.  People can also learn about securing computers and mobile devices as well as how to get the most out of the Internet.  We used Safer Internet Day last month to drive awareness about these online resources by including a link to the Good to Know portal on our search homepage <i>google.ie<\/i>.  In addition to using technologies that provide an extra layer of protection for users, we have also formed partnerships.  Google is a member of a number of organisations which work directly with companies to help them to improve safety and security for users.  We collaborate with European Schoolnet and anti-bullying groups.  We recently supported European Schoolnet's <i>The Web We Want<\/i>booklet, which is an educational document designed with the needs and preferences of young people in mind.  <i>The Web We Want<\/i>aims to start getting young people to think about how to manage their digital reputations and advises them on their rights and responsibilities online.  The booklet was designed to be used in the classroom and for peer-to-peer learning.<\/p><p> Finally, I offer a few thoughts on where industry, governments and other stakeholders can work together better in this area.  We believe it is critical to listen to and work with experts and organisations in this area, including those people who have their ear to the ground with regard to the technologies families are using and the challenges they face along the way.  We collaborate extensively with experts and draw heavily on their advice and feedback to constantly review and improve our systems.  A recommendation that has been made strongly to us is to focus more on peer-to-peer learning.<\/p> <p>Based on that advice we recently launched the web rangers project in Israel which brought together over 200 children up and down the country to design and run their own safety campaigns.  It was a huge success, with the participants producing 82 safety campaigns that ultimately reached over 20,000 children.  The campaigns worked well because they addressed children's issues and spoke to them in their own language.  Likewise BeatBullying, the largest bullying prevention charity in the United Kingdom, has a cyber mentoring scheme in which young people mentor their peers.  This project has been very successful in reaching vulnerable children.  We strongly recommend providing more support for such peer-to-peer learning projects and would be happy to work with the Government in taking the lead on such projects.<\/p><p> I have mentioned that as a platform provider, we have a duty to make sure we give our users the tools they need to stay safe online, but we also believe the Government has a role to make sure parents, teachers and students acquire the digital skills they need to keep themselves safe online.  Learning to use the Internet is as important a lifeskill today as the safe cross code.  Digital literacy, for example, how to verify online sources, protect information and where to go for help, should be a vital part of every child's education.  We believe a coherent digital literacy curriculum in schools would dramatically improve children's safety and would be happy to work with the Department of Education and Skills on any effort in this area.  We recently made a submission to the New Zealand Government setting out in detail what such a curriculum might look like.  I have brought a copy of that submission for the committee in order that members can read it in detail.  If questions arise, we would be happy to respond at a later date.<\/p><p> I hope the committee can see just how seriously we take the safety of our users.  We have worked long and hard and invested heavily in ensuring our users have a safe and positive experience online.  We are constantly innovating and improving our products.  Ms Frank and I look forward to answering questions the committee may have and working with it in the coming weeks in this important area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000003#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sue Duke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363773000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I am glad that Miss Duke's presentation points out that YouTube does take everything seriously, particularly any form of bullying.

I acknowledge the great work the company is doing and wish it well in its future endeavours.  It is interesting to see the figures which show how the company has taken off globally in the past ten years and its interaction with the ordinary citizen.  The committee is trying to ascertain the legal issues around cyber bullying and posting defamatory material on YouTube and other social media.  Ms Duke has outlined the company's policy on flagging and how it deals internally with something dangerous, misleading or malicious on the site.  What resources does it put into this work?  It must be an enormous job to police the site, judging by the volume of traffic on it.<\/p><p>  The Internet is a bread and butter matter for kids growing up today.  What data does the company have on the issue of suicide?  People are interacting at very vulnerable times in their lives.  Has YouTube dedicated any resources to dealing with this issue?  Can Ms Duke safely say the company has intervened when people have posted such material or was it too late?  That kind of information is hugely important.  We would all love to think that from playschool on society is pleasant and that no one makes malicious comments, as everybody wants to live in Utopia.<\/p><p>  The question of whether there is a gap or otherwise in the legislation in Ireland or internationally is constantly raised.  The Minister outlined it in the opening paragraphs of his contribution before we started these hearings.  Many believe that when they are damaged by malicious comment on the Internet, whether on YouTube or any other platform, they have no recourse to the law.  What recourse is available if somebody from outside the State posts something defamatory about an individual that is without foundation and damaging?  Is there inter-jurisdictional legislation in place?  What law or recourse is available to that person?  There is a great deal of evidence, anecdotal and factual, that what is happening on the Internet is causing huge damage to a certain percentage of people.  We do not have to go outside the Republic to see the numbers who have been damaged.  If that reflects the percentage worldwide, a very high percentage of people are affected.  Many access this very successful technology, from which the general populace derives great good.  Is it necessary for the United Nations or other international bodies to take this crime as seriously as they do any other?<\/p><p>  Ms Duke has shown us how much the technology has developed in the past ten years, with 4 billion people using it, and for how many hours each person uses it.  What do we need to do?  We want to present a report to the Government and others on what we believe is the way forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000005#E00600","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363773000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  To answer the question about the resources we have invested in this area, a high volume of content is being uploaded all the time.  We have developed a flagging system precisely to allow us to handle the content.  Once a report is received, it is sent to a YouTube policy enforcement team.  We have multiple teams working around the clock, around the globe, covering all geographical regions and time zones, to make sure that once content is flagged, it is examined and if it violates our rules, it is taken down very quickly.<\/p><p>  It is not true to say the Internet is an unregulated Wild West space.  What is a crime offline is a crime online and legislation dealing with offline crimes applies equally to online crimes.  There are regulations and directives that apply to online transactions and behaviour and, in addition, there are self-regulatory models that companies have come up with at a global level to enforce rules on the Internet.  Many companies have a community policing system similar to the one we have developed.<\/p> <p> The third point relates to the multi-jurisdictional aspect.  We accept that the police force has an extremely difficult job to do.  It is a difficult job when looking at crimes across a number of jurisdictions, whether online or offline.  There could be an improvement in educating law enforcement agencies on the tools and information available to them in investigating online crime.  We started to do this with law enforcement agencies in America and are hoping to extend this work to other jurisdictions, including Ireland.  That would go a long way towards informing law enforcement agencies in many jurisdictions of how to tackle these issues and co-operate with other law enforcement agencies where crimes are of a transnational nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000005#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sue Duke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363773600,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Duke and Ms Frank for their attendance and interesting presentation.  I have no doubt that they take abuse and inappropriate behaviour online seriously, which is welcome.  Will they outline where and how Google and YouTube generate revenue?  The more postings, downloads, views and activity on the site, the greater the revenue.  The Korean video of \"Gangnam Style\" generated 1 billion views, which is extraordinary.  How does this activity generate revenue for the company and those who upload content?<\/p><p>  Suicide was a secondary option in the drop-down menu shown in the presentation.  Is there any consideration given by Google to making it a primary option in the drop-down menu?  It is becoming a huge issue and this measure may prove helpful.<\/p><p>  From what our guests have said, users have protection.  They can choose to vary their privacy settings, but subjects of content do not seem to have the same protection.  One of my concerns is how the subject, rather than the user, of content might encounter difficulties.  This applies not only to the content but also to comments made afterwards.  Last night I looked at a music video on YouTube.  It was of a folk singer from this country who had passed away.  The subject was in a minority group, but it did not take me long to find a comment that any Member would be lambasted for making.  It is still online and it is an incitement issue.  It may never have been flagged to YouTube.  I understand how the rules work with community policing, but it could happen anywhere.  If it was flagged by a subject, does YouTube or Google have tracing capabilities?  Where content is flagged and being dealt with by someone, is there a timeline, record or log of how the company deals with the report?<\/p><p>  Does Google or YouTube work with the office for Internet safety in the Department of Justice and Equality?  There are cases in which users violate the rules which are quite strong.  I am pleased that the rules are so effective.  When users violate them, there are sanctions and they can be suspended.  What happens when users violate the law?  Does Google or YouTube contact law enforcement agencies directly or leave it to those who have been injured to do so?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000006#F00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363773600,"counter":312,"content":"<p>On the first point, the YouTube revenue model focuses on advertising and forming partnerships.  When the Deputy was on YouTube last night, he probably noticed that we formed partnerships with channels, merchants and individuals.  Under the advertising model, we share revenue with our partners.<\/p><p>  The second question was related to foregrounding the suicide and self-injury category.  We recently added this category because the feedback from users was that, where they saw a threat of suicide or self-harm, it would be useful to have a specific box to tick to highlight the issue to YouTube.  That is why it is place and we use the same dynamic to consider whether it should be a stand-alone category.  If users say it should not be categorised under the heading of abusive and harmful content and should be a stand-alone category, that is something we will examine.<\/p><p>  The third question concerned videos.  If there is a video on which someone is being treated wrongly or abusively, there is the option to flag the content.  The second option involves using our privacy complaints process.  As a user, if someone appears on a video but does not want to be included in it and the video identifies him or her by showing his or her face or revealing a name or personal details, there is a very straightforward form in our help centre which requires the URL of the video, to know who the person is and how he or she has been identified.  As long as the video is not in the public interest and where there is no issue of consent, we remove it.  I did not include the issue in my presentation, but I am happy to send the details to the committee.<\/p><p>  The other issue was related to criminal investigations.  It is an extension of my previous comments.  We have included the details of the privacy complaints process because the video may not break any rule while still violating someone's right to privacy.  In that case, we remove it.  If someone's right to privacy is infringed, we respond.  Likewise, one has normal legal recourse offline to report a crime committed against a person or where rights are being infringed.  Where there is due legal process, we co-operate with law enforcement agencies in investigating the crime and, potentially, assisting in prosecuting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sue Duke"},{"type":"speech","time":1363773600,"counter":313,"content":"<p>When co-operating with law enforcement agencies, does YouTube engage first or does it wait for the law enforcement agencies to engage with it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000006#F00400","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363773600,"counter":314,"content":"<p>The law enforcement agencies engage with us.

I assume the company has a legal department to offer advice on these issues and analyse information and regularly update staff in this regard.  Perhaps Ms Duke might elaborate on that aspect.<\/p><p> There is also a language problem as social media spread across jurisdictions.  How does the company address this issue, given that it has staff in every country?  Language usage varies between and within countries and identifying what is considered abusive by one person or group as to opposed to another is an issue.  That argument also applies to religion.  Somebody in the West might have a different view compared to someone in the East, Africa or on another continent.  Is this taken into account when handling complaints?  How is this aspect monitored?<\/p><p> With regard to people remaining anonymous, will Ms Duke elaborate on how YouTube identifies who is online and how it takes people offline?

It is important that we educate teachers and equip parents and students in their early years with the proper tools.  We are all educated to read books critically and carefully and understand the context in books, but we are not well equipped to do the same in the online world.  This is where we can see we have a role we can play and co-operate and have many partnerships with experts in this area.  My colleague mentioned peer-to-peer projects.  We have similar projects in different countries and would love to explore with the committee whether we could so something similar in Ireland.  Our experience is that teenagers take it much more seriously if people of the same age educate them and it is much easier for them to turn to them if they have a question or problem.  It is also about having a level of trust.  They trust their own peer group more than older people.

The example of the US President, Mr. Obama, dealing with bullying and LGBT groups shows how YouTube and the Internet can be used positively.  With regard to the flagging system YouTube has for inappropriate material, in some ways it only happens after the event.  There was a case in Dublin recently of a young man dodging a taxi fare after a night out which was videoed and, subsequently, put up on YouTube.  It went viral but another young man was identified wrongly as the man in the video and he had to go to court to try to have it taken down.  Is there someone in real time monitoring what is going up on YouTube?<\/p><p>  I accept that freedom of expression includes the right to remain anonymous.

As a teacher before I came into the D&aacute;il, I believe YouTube is a strong power for good and a great teaching aid.  It was used by me and my peers to enhance our teaching practices.  For example, when teaching the safe cross code to six year olds, it is easier to get a YouTube interactive video with the song up on the whiteboard rather than having to sing it out one's self.  However, most schools, particularly primary schools, have robust Internet policies and block access to YouTube to prevent children from seeing unsuitable material.  Has YouTube ever considered, with the Department of Education and Skills, a separate platform for YouTube's education videos?  It could be rolled out across the European Union.<\/p><p>  In my constituency a fortnight ago, the principal of a post-primary school took a robust and concerted approach to dealing with an issue on a different social media platform which has since become a high-profile incident covered in national media outlets.  When YouTube receives a complaint from a person about a video uploaded on its platform, how long does it take to remove it?  The last thing anyone wants is for people to have to go to the courts to have a clip taken down.  Usually, the person's identity becomes known through court proceedings and more people will look at the upload.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000008#H01000","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1363774800,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I call Senator Brennan, who had to plough through snow to get to today's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000008#H01100","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1363774800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I woke up to four inches of snow this morning.<\/p> <p>Ten miles away there was no sign of snow but that is how it goes.

Then, consequently, it goes on to national school level.  In some instances it might simply be by staring at people.  I am concerned about this issue.  In the case of three or four young children from a particular national school the natural progression would have been to the nearby secondary school, but since they were being bullied by people in the national school who were going to take the same steps to second level they changed their whole career and, in some cases, at grave expense by going to private schools to ensure that they would not be followed into second level.  It concerns me that it will continue.  Some children at national school are afraid to tell their parents in case their parents take action against those involved and things get worse.  Parents and teachers have a significant part to play.

The committee can imagine the difficulty that poses in terms of having someone examining the content going up given that every minute there are 72 hours going up.<\/p><p>  What YouTube is, why it works, why it is so successful and why people go back to it is because it allows them to take a video and upload and share it instantly.

It is important to maintain the integrity of the platform for the vast majority of users who use it for good.<\/p><p>  It is not a question of either pre-screening the content or doing nothing.  I have already referred today to several systems we have in place to ensure that when content is uploaded and if it breaks the rules, then it is flagged and we get to that content quickly.  If it breaks the rules we take it down very quickly.  We are constantly improving those systems and examining them to see where we can make improvements.  For example, recently we introduced the deputise programme where we have trusted flaggers in organisations.  These are people that we know who have a history of flagging content that was abusive and that broke the rules.  Such people have logged complaints with us and it turns out that they were legitimate complaints.  Now, we look at the flags these people log quickly because we know that they are a reliable source.

Similarly, there is a safety mode on YouTube.  This means a parent can set YouTube to safety mode and this means mature content that does not break the rules but which is not necessarily appropriate for a child will be hidden.

It is very knowledgeable about this area and it is a great partner for us to work on, specifically flagging such content.  These are the types of partners we are looking for and we would be happy to engage with more local partners.  If the committee could point us to any well-known NGOs here it would be of great help for us as well.<\/p><p>  Senator Brennan commented on where bullying starts and what we can do about it.  I fully agree that bullying is an online phenomenon as well as an offline one.  In most cases it actually starts offline.  We know from statistics that in most online cases which we know of, the origin is from an offline encounter.  Many of these children know each other from schools and it simply extends to the online world.  We need to fight the idea of not being trustworthy and respectful to others.  I cannot really judge whether the information should go across school systems.  That is more a decision the committee and others must make.  However, it is important for schools to work precisely with students on reputational issues.  Perhaps the Chairman will allow me to give another example.  We have developed a campaign called 361 Degree Tolerance.  It is a YouTube channel we have created with several partners in Germany.  We asked students and schools to give us video material and to set out how they define reputation and how to fight anti-respectful behaviour.  This is the third time we have done the exercise and on the first two occasions we received 700 videos from youngsters between 13 and 25 years.  This is a great way for them to engage and show us how they see respectful behaviour.  We know that if people take action they are more likely to flag content if they see someone being bullied online.  This is where we must get to.  People must take action not only if they or their families are attacked but if they see people being attacked in the offline and online worlds.  This is where we want to help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000009#J00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Sabine Frank"},{"type":"speech","time":1363775400,"counter":348,"content":"<p>The Department of Education and Skills and especially the Department of Children and Youth Affairs are the two Departments to which the Government must link.<\/p> <p>If we were to link with Google-YouTube from now on, would it be able to monitor whether there was an increase or decrease in the number of complaints about bullying on its systems?

Digital Rights Ireland was set up in 2005.  We had a concern that while traditional civil liberties were well represented offline by the likes of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, new issues were arising online that needed an additional input that perhaps did not come from more traditional groups.  We have since joined similar groups across Europe in the European digital rights initiative and instituted a constitutional challenge against a European law that we believe violates privacy.  This challenge will shortly be given a hearing before the European Court of Justice.  We have also engaged with people, including a number of those present, on issues such as online privacy, Internet filtering and blocking.<\/p><p>  I am associate dean at the school of law in UCD, where I specialise in information technology law issues.  I am also a practising solicitor, working both for social media websites and users who believe their rights have been violated.  My colleague, Mr. Fergal Crehan, is a practising barrister.  He has advised Digital Rights Ireland from the outset, including in our constitutional challenge which is before the European Court of Justice.  He is also a specialist in this area.<\/p><p>  As committee members are aware, abuse of the online medium is very far from being a new phenomenon.  On the slide before us we have the first report I was able to find of a criminal conviction for this type of behaviour.  It dates back to 1999, when a man was jailed under the old criminal libel legislation for spreading false allegations of sexual abuse against a teacher.  That example illustrates that this is very far from being a new issue and that it is one very much regulated by existing laws.  Going back to 1999, we see that where the will and the resources are available to allow enforcement, we can achieve results using existing laws.<\/p><p>  I have listed on the slide I am displaying a number of the laws that can be used.  I had to hold myself back so as to cram them into one slide as I could have filled two or three listing relevant legislation, but I did not want to bore members.  I would like to make some particular points about certain aspects of the legislation, some of which have been mentioned in previous hearings.  Deputy Dessie Ellis mentioned earlier the phenomenon in his constituency of threats being made via YouTube.  It is not always realised that there is an existing offence which applies.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act provides in section 5 for a distinct offence of making threats to kill or cause serious harm.  Therefore, this constitutes a crime which can be prosecuted under existing laws.<\/p><p>  Deputy Noel Harrington asked earlier about the rights of the subjects of YouTube videos.  Again, these rights are already amply protected by Irish data protection law.  There are general rights in section 2 of the Data Protection Acts to ensure one's information is fairly obtained and processed.  There is also a specific right in section 6A of the Data Protection Acts which provides people with the ability to object to the processing of his or her personal data that will cause him or her distress.  Perhaps there is not adequate awareness of these rights and we need more education of users about their rights and more resources to enforce these rights.<\/p><p>  That leads us to the point made by Deputy Ann Phelan who mentioned the jurisdictional issue and the possibility of cross-border enforcement.  One of the benefits of data protection law is that it is largely harmonised across Europe.  Therefore, we already have instances to which we can refer if material is hosted in the United Kingdom, Germany or France, etc.<\/p> <p>We can go to the local data protection regulators and ask them to enforce Irish citizens' rights, which are largely the same in those jurisdictions as they are here.  We already have substantial laws in place that deal with most of these points.<\/p><p> I would like to respond to what Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny said earlier about traceability.  This is covered in two ways.  A so-called Norwich Pharmacal order can be used to enable users to be identified by the High Court in civil actions.  Section 8 of the Data Protection Act enables information to be released to the Garda by YouTube - for example, to aid the force in its criminal investigations.  While the tools are already there to authorise disclosure in many cases, whether there is enough awareness of those tools may be another matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000010#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.

In 2005, the Irish music industry brought an action against people it accused of uploading music.  It obtained the IP addresses of those individuals.  It then had to link those IP addresses to particular names and addresses.  It decided to get a Norwich Pharmacal order, which is named after an English case from the 1970s.  It went to the High Court and got an order from Mr. Justice Peter Kelly requiring the ISP - Eircom, in this case - to disclose the identities of the individuals in question.  This approach has been used quite commonly since then.  I recently counted the number of applications for Norwich Pharmacal orders that have been made in Ireland in recent years.  We know of six or seven such applications that have been made in the last three years.  The number is probably much greater because not all of them necessarily appear in the media.  The jurisdiction of such orders is well established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000011#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.

One of the problems with Irish law is that we have an access to justice issue that is not unique to this area.  A billionaire will find it much easier to assert his rights than an average citizen.  Unfortunately, we are not an outlier in this regard.  As a lawyer, I do not want to stand here and say lawyers are too expensive, but perhaps that can be said of the courts system generally.  Collectively, those of us who offer the technical expertise needed to enforce one's rights are too expensive.<\/p><p>  I am concerned that if we make changes to existing laws, we might undermine some of the rights that currently exist.  An example of this relates to anonymity.  It has been suggested at this committee that a greater degree of identification can be provided for by requiring real-name registration of users, etc.  I am sure the members of the committee will be familiar with two great Irish writers who chose to write anonymously for various reasons: Jonathan Swift and Myles na gCopaleen, aka Flann O'Brien, aka Brian O'Nolan and many other names.  Just as people find it important to protect their identities online, Brian O'Nolan wrote anonymously because of his position as a civil servant.  Some media columns are written anonymously by politicians so that they have the freedom to speak with a certain candour they might not otherwise be able to show.  I am thinking particularly of the Drapier column in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.<\/p><p>  Similarly, Barnardos recommends that children should be able to speak freely about issues such as parental break-up via chat lines, forums or blogs.  It strongly recommends that children who use the Internet to talk through their issues and engage with others about the challenges they face should never use their real names or reveal their identities online in case this might be used to persecute them in future.  There has to be a concern that if we begin to restrict privacy online, it may have unintended consequences for vulnerable groups such as victims of domestic abuse.  The Women's Aid website talks about the risks to women whose abusers discover what they do online.  Such abusers often use their online identities to track women, or use the fact that women might be seeking help online to prevent them from leaving abusive relationships.  Privacy is important for such women.<\/p><p>  This issue also arises in a slightly more unexpected context.  In 2006, Ryanair brought an action against the Ryanair European Pilots' Association website to seek to identify particular pilots who were posting anonymously to complain about their working conditions, terms of employment, etc.  Ryanair essentially claimed to be protecting the safety of its workplace, but the High Court rejected its application.  Mr. Justice T. C. Smyth took the view that, rather than engaging in a bona fide application, Ryanair had engaged in a &quot;feigned exercise&quot; designed to divide the loyalty of members of the IALPA union.  He said it formed part of a &quot;war of attrition&quot; on Ryanair captains, aimed at dissuading them from exercising their rights through legal battle.  There is a concern that if the captains in that case had been identified, they would have been unable to gather together collectively to exercise their right to form a union, engage in union activity and possibly take industrial action.<\/p><p>  The final example I would like to give relates to whistleblowers.  The committee will be familiar with the case of Mr. Noel Wardick, a senior member of staff at the Irish Red Cross who expressed concerns about the governance of that organisation in an anonymous blog.  He was eventually identified after an application was made seeking his identity from Blogger, which is a blogging platform operated by Google.  He identified himself and, as a result, was dismissed from his position at the Irish Red Cross.  I understand he testified before the Oireachtas on a number of occasions to elaborate on his governance concerns.  We are concerned that restrictions which make it easier to identify people will tend to deter potential whistleblowers from coming forward.<\/p><p>  A related point arises when we think about how existing telecommunications law might be applied to the Internet.  It has been mentioned at previous hearings that the sending of abusive messages is an offence under section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951.  If we expand that offence further, there is a real risk that it might have unintended effects on what can be said online.  With the permission of the Chair, I will ask my colleague, Mr. Crehan, to address that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000011#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. T. J. McIntyre"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1363776600,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 does not date back to 1951.  It is a much more recent creation.  The original Act was most recently amended in 2007.  Section 13, as most recently amended, deals with messages sent by telephone, including text messages, that are &quot;grossly offensive ... indecent, obscene or menacing&quot;.  It also deals with messages persistently sent &quot;for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, or needless anxiety to another person&quot;.  This applies to persistent nuisance telephone calls.  It also applies to messages &quot;that the sender knows to be false&quot; and to prank calls.  If one examines the Oireachtas record from the time this most recent amendment was made, one will find that the purpose of this section is to deal with telephone messages which are person-to-person communications.  Any harassment that happens via person-to-person communication is by its nature far more intimate than something one might stumble across on the Internet following a Google search.  There was a very good reason Internet communications were not included in that section.<\/p><p>  It has been suggested that the section is ripe to be expanded away from person-to-person telecommunications and into Internet communications in general.  We have concerns about that.  Our first concern is that the concept of intimacy of harassment would be lost.  We would be dealing with something that is spoken to the world at large but to nobody in particular.  Deputy O'Donovan made a telling point last week when he said it would be a case of moving the focus from talking to a person to talking about a person.  Harassment can take place when a person is spoken to aggressively.  Freedom of expression issues come into play, however, when it comes to talking about a person.  One of the problems we see with expanding this offence is that it would potentially criminalise every web page, every online newspaper story and every RTE broadcast placed on <i>rte.ie<\/i> that is intended to cause annoyance.  It is in the nature of certain kinds of political art or political speech-making that annoyance or provocation is intended.  That would be criminalised immediately.  Such a measure would create a very subjective crime.  We would have to decide what is grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing.  If one examines a forum such as <i>politics.ie<\/i>, in which partisan politics are involved, one finds that tempers frequently run high, especially coming up to elections.  One man's vigorous debate is another man's offensive, grossly offensive or indecent message.<\/p> <p>It is a very subjective question.  Do we allow judges decide, given different judges may have different views on what is grossly offensive, or do we attempt to set some sort of a subjective standard based on the offence caused to the person who was offended?  If we do that, we effectively allow the most easily offended people to set the standard for freedom of expression.<\/p><p> It would also break the principle of parity between online and offline speech in that it would make it a crime to say something online which it was not a crime to say offline.  There are certain admittedly unsavoury things that are shouted, for example, on the terraces of a football or hurling match but, if the same is said online, it suddenly becomes a crime.  There are difficulties of parity in this regard.<\/p><p> A key practical point is that it would add to the already huge workload of the Garda computer crime unit.  These would be very work-intensive offences to investigate and prosecute.  They would be dumping a huge amount of very work-intensive offences onto the desk of the Garda computer crime unit which, as we will see, is already significantly overworked.  There is a comparable law in England and Wales, at section 127 of the Communications Act 2003, which is not limited to telephone messages in the same way this is.  It has been misused and the Crown Prosecution Service has recently issued guidelines suggesting these kinds of grossly offensive prosecutions not be pursued in the public interest.  It was felt it would lead to a debacle and that the focus should be moved back to person-to-person communications of a threatening nature.  In any case, we feel expanding section 13 would likely be in breach of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Freedom of expression is guaranteed by our Constitution.  I also include a quote concerning the Sunday Times <i>v<\/i>. UK case, which states that freedom of expression applies to offensive, shocking and disturbing speech as well as to uncontroversial speech.  Indeed, there is very little point in having a right of freedom of expression if it only applies when one is saying things that are universally popular.<\/p><p> With regard to suggestions, we are not just here to say &quot;Do not do anything&quot;.  We understand there are issues with the Internet and that certain actions have to be taken.  With regard to what we suggest, first, we suggest adequate funding for the Data Protection Commissioner.  The graph in the slide before committee members shows funding of the Data Protection Commissioner over recent years, and members will see that, as of 2011, funding is almost back down to 2004 levels.  Over this time, a huge number of large data holders have moved into Ireland.  Because the likes of Google, Facebook and LinkedIn are based in Ireland, the Data Protection Commissioner has one of the biggest workloads of any regulator in Europe, bigger than that of countries many times the size of Ireland, because we uniquely have so many of these companies based here.  However, the Data Protection Commissioner is not adequately funded.  It has the job of regulating all of the data, for example, that Facebook holds for all of Europe yet it has a staff of 20, so few that they fit in a small office upstairs from a Centra in Portarlington.<\/p><p> We would also suggest more funding for the computer crime investigation unit.  The slide before members is from the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>last year and points out that it emerged in recent court proceedings there is a three-year waiting list to prosecute some child pornography offences because the resources simply are not available to the unit.  To create a new offence of offensive communications via the Internet would be to dump on this already clearly overworked unit a vast amount of low level, District Court level offences that are nonetheless hugely work-intensive.  We feel that until we have that unit adequately resourced to do the job it already has, it would not necessarily be a good idea to dump yet more work-intensive offences onto its desk.<\/p><p> We are happy to have been invited to the committee today and we are happy to answer any questions the members or the Chairman might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000011#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Crehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363777200,"counter":362,"content":"<p>Thank you both for staying within the time limit, which will give members an opportunity to ask questions.

It is important that people have mechanisms available to them which do not require them to spend several thousand euro on a trip to the High Court for, for example, a Norwich Pharmacal order.  One of the best ways in which people can exercise their right is through the Data Protection Commissioner's office which, as we have seen, is rather underfunded.<\/p><p>  Second, with regard to the Garda computer crime investigation unit, investigations in this area are necessarily very often cross-border and necessarily very often technically intensive.  For example, they can require looking at the contents of laptops and technical evidence.  A problem in this regard is that, in many cases, these are not very complex matters that should be handled out of Harcourt Street and, for the most part, should be handled at the local Garda station level.  However, it is the need for specialist expertise that imposes a bottleneck.

I agree with everything it said about access to the courts.  I said here last week that it is the preserve of the rich - end of story.  I know people will say that legal fees have come down but in the real world with which most of us deal, for civil matters, the courts system is the preserve of the rich.  If one has to ask the price, one cannot afford to go up to the four goldmines.  Anybody who thinks they can go up there about any matter we discussed in the past fortnight would need a serious amount of cash.  For the ordinary punter on the receiving end of some of the stuff we are discussing, access to the courts system to vindicate one's name and have it restored is simply not available.<\/p><p>  I agree with the delegation in respect of the protection of identity.  I note the examples it gave in respect of Drapier and Jonathan Swift.  If Drapier said something defamatory about a Member of the Oireachtas, one could take a case against <i>The Irish Times<\/i> or whichever newspaper published it.  The issue is where freedom of speech ends and defamation begins and how one sets margins.  In one very high-profile case, an anonymous tweet, in some people's minds, changed the outcome of an election.  I am firmly of the opinion, although I know some people would not agree with me, that this tweet did change the outcome of a very significant election.  Where does anonymity fit in there?  If Mary from Dunloe sends a politically motivated text or tweet to a programme and does untold damage as a result of a baseless allegation being read out on a national or local broadcaster, how does one marry freedom of speech with the untold damage it does to someone's reputation because somebody then says &quot;ah sure, there is no smoke without fire&quot;?<\/p><p>  I was interested in what the delegation said about the convention on cybercrime.  What are the reasons for the delay in ratifying it given that it has been knocking around since 2003?  Let us take the example of the owner of a national newspaper which publishes a story given to it by Mary, Jack, Billy, Tom and Joe on which background checks have not been done and to which everybody has added their 10% VAT so that by the time the story comes to the newspaper, it is totally different.  The newspaper goes to court and a judgement is handed down.  Based on the delegation's experiences, have any social media outlets or discussion forums been challenged in the courts recently regarding what they permit to be hosted?  A newspaper or news outlet that knowingly publishes or allows a newscaster to announce something without checking it to see if there is any element of truth in it has a vicarious liability straightaway and will take a hit on it and end up paying the piper.

The Betfair case illustrates the answer to Deputy O'Donovan's second question which concerned the liability in these situations.  The liability in these situations is governed by the e-commerce directive which provides for so-called hosting liability.  If a social networking site hosts comments a user makes, it is not liable for the comments until it has been notified of them and given an opportunity to take them down.  If a network is notified that these comments are defamatory, in breach of the criminal law or in contempt of court and fails to take them down at that point, it faces liability.

There is a great deal of legislation in place, but enforcement seems to be lacking.  The volume of traffic on these social networks is so huge that the mind boggles in terms of how one might even begin to trawl through all of the relevant material.  It is always possible to deal with serious crime because the relevant laws are in place and the Garda will become involved because of the nature of such crimes.  The most difficult crime to deal with is low-level, nuisance-type crime which is not serious enough to pursue, but it causes people the greatest level of discomfort.  If a serious crime is committed, the perpetrator will more than likely end up in prison.  There is a great deal of low-level, nuisance-type activity on social networks which no one is really too bothered about pursuing because doing so would take up too much time, funding, etc.  In addition, no one wants to clog up the courts with cases relating to the matters to which I refer.  However, the type of activity to which I refer is very abusive in nature and involves bullying.  In order to plug the gap between serious and nuisance-type crimes, would our guests be of the view that it might be useful to establish a body similar to the Press Council which could deal with social media?

The first presentation we received was from the Minister who mentioned that there might be a gap in the legislation in this regard.  In that context, Mr. Crehan referred to the relevant section of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1953.  In view of everything we have heard since these hearings began, I have come to the view that there is not a significant gap in the legislation.  Almost everyone who made a presentation indicated that what was illegal offline was similarly illegal online.  The difficulty lies in getting to a position where one can deal with this.  Each of the platforms and companies which made presentations has different ways of operating and reporting.  Some allow users to remain anonymous, while others such as Facebook demand that they identify themselves before being able to use their sites.<\/p><p>  There has been a great deal of discussion about defamation and illegal use online.  Quite often, those who are the subject of online abuse are well able to defend themselves.  I refer to politicians, business people, journalists and others who are in the public eye and would often be online.  These individuals are well educated, have access to the courts and know how to proceed in matters of this nature.  The difficulty which arises concerns those who suffer abuse and do not have the resources to go to the High Court.  In many cases, they would not even know how to report online abuse.  Mr. McIntyre has suggested increased funding be provided for the Data Protection Commissioner.  In the light of the fact that Google, Facebook and other companies have their European headquarters in this country, that is an absolute must.  The economic benefits which these companies bring to the country are vastly superior to the costs we might potentially incur in seeking to establish a balance in this area.<\/p><p>  Would there be any merit in creating some type of platform or method of connection, by means of a group or association, in order to assist teenagers who are vulnerable and might become so distressed by what they read online that they might do something similar to that which others have done?  We are all aware of the recent cases in this regard.  The committee received a presentation from the office for Internet safety, an organisation of which nobody seems to have heard and which operates under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am very disappointed that the office in question has not played a greater role in the area under discussion.  However, I am not sure it is designed to deal with it.  In addition, I do not know of any other body which might be in a position to deal with it.  Would our guests support the establishment of an entity to deal with the low-level problems to which I refer in order that we might protect the most vulnerable?

One of the approaches which might be taken as a model is that taken in the United Kingdom in which there is a Safer Internet Centre.  This centre is really just an informational resource, but it provides people with a one-stop-shop where they can indicate they have been abused or bullied online.  It then provides them with guidance on how they can access the remedies that might be available.  It might, for example, show them how to use a blocking function or the reporting function on systems such as Facebook.  If the office for Internet safety is to develop a role, I would like it to move towards emulating that model.<\/p><p>  Deputy Noel Harrington's point overlapped somewhat with that made by Deputy Ann Phelan on this being rather low-level crime.  That is an important point in the sense that we are possibly misleading ourselves by focusing on criminal prosecutions and the role of international borders.  What is often involved is localised bullying and there is not necessarily an international dimension.  In fact, there is not necessarily even a criminal dimension because many of the cases about which we are talking involve children.  It is very unlikely, as a matter of practicality, that juveniles will ever be prosecuted, even for criminal offences they may commit in this context.  Those of us who are parents would not want children to obtain criminal records for ill-judged tweets they might have issued one night.  We might be better served by focusing more on concrete examples of abuse rather than on some of the hypothetical issues which do not necessarily arise.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ann Phelan also inquired whether there was a case to be made for the establishment of a body similar to the Press Council to monitor social media.  We already have such a thing in the individual complaint resolution systems set up within the likes of Facebook, <i>boards.ie<\/i>, YouTube and so on.  All of these entities operate their own complaint resolution services.  I can see merit in having a one-stop-shop, but if one were established, it would threaten the diversity that is extremely important.  Ultimately, we are discussing online communities which operate to different standards.  Some of these communities are very family-friendly in nature and enforce certain standards in respect of identity.  I refer, for example, to Facebook.  Others such as Twitter are much more open and freewheeling and allow users to remain anonymous.  There are still others which are much more vitriolic and I daresay <i>politics.ie<\/i> falls into that category.  We do not want a one-size-fits-all solution which would, in effect, try to impose a single set of standards on all of these disparate organisations.<\/p> <p>The UK Safer Internet Centre might be more useful as a front-end to those individual complaint resolution mechanisms, rather than having a separate body which would adjudicate on complaints about all of the different communities.  Ultimately, the governance of each individual Internet community should be, in the first instance - if it does not break the law - a matter for the community itself.<\/p><p> Deputy Ellis also made a point regarding prior filtering or monitoring, by analogy with the practice carried out in England for many years - which may still continue - of monitoring all telephone calls from Ireland and looking for certain suspicious keywords.  This is governed by European law.  Article 15 of the e-commerce directive provides that we may not impose a general duty to monitor on Internet service providers.  This means that the law may not, for example, require the likes of YouTube to pre-moderate every video before it goes up or, for example, implement a keyword filtering system before a video goes live.  That said, there is nothing to stop an individual provider from choosing to do that if it wishes.  For example, Facebook would certainly be entitled to monitor public posts for bad language, if it wished, and block those posts.  Again, I suggest that this is really a matter for the community norms within each organisation rather than a one-size-fits-all legislative solution.<\/p><p> Mr. Crehan will address the remaining points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000014#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.

We need to ask whether some of these problems can be fixed by legislation and whether there is a lack of legislation to deal with bullying.  In a classic case of bullying, a child is beaten up and his lunch money is stolen.  In the adult world we call that a mugging and people are sent to jail for committing this offence.  We have to ask ourselves if that is how we want to deal with bullying.  Are there legal remedies to bullying, or is it something that has to be dealt with on a much lower, more educational level?  I would say that it is.  I agree that laws to deal with bullying exist, but it may not necessarily be a good idea to involve the law.  Some kind of educational programme is necessary.  There are television advertisements about drink awareness, food safety and various other public health issues.  I argue that this is a public health issue in that, when children go to school, they learn to read and write but they also learn how to play with other children, how to get on with people their own age or different ages, and how to respect people who are different from them.  That is what they learn in the playground, outside of the classroom.  Increasingly, children and adults live their lives online.  This may provide education not only from the point of view of general socialising and learning to play with one's peers but also from a civic point of view.  If we are to have some kind of civic education where debate and public debate is polite and reasonable, then this may be something to be considered at an educational level.  <\/p><p>  Deputies O'Donovan and Ellis asked about tweets and text messages sent to radio programmes.  They referred to the famous occasion of the presidential debate.  In my experience, radio station presenters have a computer in front of them and they read whatever they think is interesting as a contribution to the programme.  The presenter is acting in a journalistic role.  There is no filtering except that the broadcaster chooses what he or she decides is a funny tweet or an interesting text, which is then read out.  In the event that something defamatory is read out, it will be that journalist's and that radio station's necks on the line.  It may not be financially worth their while to go after the person who sent the tweet or the text.  However, they are free to do so and they can join the person as parties to the dispute.  There is no question of filtering.  Broadcasters decide what they want to read out, in the same way as newspapers.  Deputy O'Donovan said that stories often snowball with quotes from various parties.  Everyone has their ten percent added.  The journalist and the editor must decide whether their sources are credible or otherwise.  If a source is only a tweet, then it may not be a good idea to go to print.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000015#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Crehan"},{"type":"speech","time":1363779000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>There is a distinction, in my view.  To be fair, a journalist will not print in a newspaper, \"Anne from Kilkenny says...\".  Neither will a journalist identify a source by a nickname.

The media are already subject to obligations, be it to the Press Council in the case of newspapers or to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in the case of the broadcast media.  Deputy O'Donovan's example is striking because it illustrates that abuses will occasionally arise even in a heavily regulated environment.  That is not necessarily an argument for extending regulation to a different context, particularly because the editorial involvement and endorsement are very different in each case.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, a newspaper that stands over what it publishes.  Its brand stands for a certain level of integrity and truthfulness in the content of the articles it prints.  It is not open to <i>The Irish Times<\/i> to say that it is not willing to stand over what John Waters said today.  It would be very misleading to extend that analogy to the Internet, where we do not expect Twitter or Facebook or YouTube to stand over everything their users say.  The idea that we should take a principle that has developed in the context of media that select whose words they will print, the editorial line they will take and so on, and then apply that to providers that really are just conduits for the opinions of other people-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013032000015#P00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.
