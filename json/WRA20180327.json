The provision of redress is intended to return impacted customers to the position that they would have been in had the relevant issue not arisen and the compensation, which is to be reasonable, must reflect the detriment involved arising from and\/or associated with being on an incorrect rate.

It also included a programme of enforcement action, underpinned by legislative changes including a &ldquo;reckless trading&rdquo; provision under excise law for oil traders, that have been introduced over a number of Finance Acts, to strengthen Revenue&rsquo;s powers for dealing with this kind of fraud.  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to introduce from the beginning of April 2015, in Ireland and the United Kingdom, a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in significantly curtailing fuel fraud in Ireland.  This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel in recent years.  I am also advised that Revenue conducted National Random Sampling Programmes in 2016, 2017 and 2018 with a view to obtaining an updated picture of the extent of the fuel laundering problem.  The programmes involved selecting a random sample comprising nearly one in every ten of the 2,500 holders of Auto Fuel Trader Licences (any trader that produces, sells, deals in, or keeps for sale or delivery road diesel is legally obliged to hold such a licence).  Road diesel samples were taken from all traders in the programme and tested for the presence of the marker introduced in 2015.  In all three years, no evidence of this marker was found in any of the samples tested.  This constitutes persuasive evidence that the strategy undertaken in recent years has resulted in the near elimination of selling of laundered product at retail level.  The available evidence to date indicates that Accutrace cannot be laundered by conventional methods.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that while the effectiveness of the measures introduced over the last few years is very welcome as is and the very positive outcome of the collaboration with HMRC, Revenue is not complacent and is mindful of the resourcefulness of those involved in criminality in the fuel trade.  Revenue remains vigilant and ready to respond to any new developments in this area. <\/p>  <p>  Action is taken against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade and includes a range of measures to identify and target persons engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those involved.  Revenue&rsquo;s multifaceted strategy encompasses ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, the use of analytics and detection technologies, optimising the deployment of resources and extensive cooperation (including the development and sharing of intelligence) on a national, EU and international basis.<\/p>  <p>  A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the risk based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages contribute to the effectiveness of Revenue&rsquo;s goal of intercepting the supply of illicit tobacco products.  Revenue also targets the illicit trade in tobacco at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Action has also been taken through Finance Acts over recent years to ensure that Revenue has the statutory powers necessary for undertaking its important work against the illegal tobacco trade.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Revenue, who in a joint operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as part of the Joint Agency Task Force, last week closed down an illicit commercial cigarette factory in Jenkinstown, Co. Louth.\u00a0 I understand from Revenue that this was the first time a commercial illicit cigarette production plant was discovered in the State and the factory was in full operation when Revenue officers and the Armed Support Unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na entered the premises.  Revenue officers found more than 60 tonnes of tobacco, all the pre-cursor components for the manufacture of cigarettes, and approximately 25 million cigarettes ready for distribution.  This was a sophisticated self-contained operation with machinery capable of producing 250,000 illicit cigarettes per hour and pre-processing, processing and packaging facilities, along with living quarters.<\/p>  <p>  In assessing the overall effectiveness in tackling the illegal tobacco trade, a reliable measure is provided by the annual surveys of illegal tobacco products carried out by IPSOS\/MRBI for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive.  The survey in 2017 found that 13% of cigarette packs encountered in the course of the project were illicit.  This figure is slightly up from the levels of 12% and 10% reported in 2015 and 2016 respectively but is nevertheless lower than in earlier years.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel and tobacco fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.  This work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up in 2016, in the framework of &ldquo;A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan&rdquo;, of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts.  Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat both the illicit fuel and tobacco trades.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit tobacco trade has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action in these areas will continue to be a high priority.  In addition, I can say to the Deputy that I will give careful consideration to any further proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue to enhance their capacity to deal effectively with fraud and criminality in these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB01450"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[5754\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the economic impact assessments his Department has commissioned on Brexit.","asker":"1353","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":55,"content":"<p>My Department has been to the fore in producing and funding a number of Brexit-related studies, both before and since the UK's referendum decision.

Unfortunately, particularly in relation to younger drivers this has not always been positive.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would recommend drivers who are quoted increased premiums to consult the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website, which has an informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance generally.\u00a0 One of the key tips listed to help cut costs is to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Union Services","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[13624\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the work being undertaken by his Department to implement the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach's recommendation that credit unions be able to lend to affordable housing bodies and local authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[13619\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department is examining an amendment to the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 to allow credit unions lend to affordable housing bodies and local authorities as recommended by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 97 together.<\/p>  <p>  The common bond restrictions limit the potential for credit unions to lend to housing bodies and local authorities, either directly or on a syndicated basis. <\/p>  <p>  As previously set out in my reply to parliamentary question No. 55 for written answer on 22nd February 2018, the Credit Union and Co-Operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 introduced changes to the Credit Union Act, 1997 (the 1997 Act).  Since 1 January 2016, section 43 of the 1997 Act\u00a0provides that the Central Bank may prescribe investments in which a credit union may invest its funds.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank undertook a review of the investment framework for credit unions in 2017.  This review resulted in the publication of Consultation Paper 109 (CP109) which consulted on potential changes to the investment framework for credit unions.  One of the proposals in CP109 was that credit unions be permitted to provide funding for the provision of social housing to Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).<\/p>  <p>  Submissions to CP109 were broadly supportive of credit unions providing funding to Tier 3 AHBs.  Taking account of the feedback provided to CP109, amended regulations commenced on 1 March 2018 which permit credit unions to provide funding to Tier 3 AHBs for the provision of social housing.  The maximum permitted investment amount per credit union is 50% of regulatory reserves where a credit union has total assets of at least &euro;100 million and 25% of regulatory reserves for all other credit unions.  These limits may facilitate a combined sector investment in Tier 3 AHBs of close to &euro;700 million. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is open to considering further investment proposals.  Where the Central Bank receives detailed proposals which can demonstrate that an investment could fall within the appropriate risk profile for credit union investments, it will consider further amendments to the investment regulations to facilitate such investments in the future. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has committed to undertaking and publishing analysis of credit union sector investments, two years post commencement of the amending investment regulations for credit unions, to assess and analyse the actual impact which the changes to the investment regulations have had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[11060\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has engaged with the special liquidator of IBRC regarding the release of internal documents by a former official of the bank (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[11099\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the circumstances which allowed a person (details supplied) to furnish internal IBRC documents to a further person (details supplied) regarding the conduct of a person (details supplied) on matters pertaining to the IBRC's treatment of a debtor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[11031\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has engaged with the special liquidator of IBRC regarding the release of internal bank documents by a former bank official to a former debtor of the bank (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[11110\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the circumstances which led to a former official of a bank (details supplied) making allegations against another person and furnishing internal IBRC documents to a further person for use in a legal case being pursued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[14247\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700059#WRB02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has engaged with the special liquidator of IBRC regarding the release of internal IBRC documents by a former IBRC official (details supplied) to a former debtor of the bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 95, 107, 115, 178 and 210 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Special Liquidators of IBRC that, having obtained information that a former employee of IBRC may have had documentation in his possession which belonged to IBRC, their legal advisors engaged in correspondence with the former employee to get details of what documentation was in his possession and the circumstances surrounding same.

These frameworks were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.

As a result impacted firms in both Ireland and the UK are extensively engaged in contingency planning which may result in the relocation of business from the UK to the EU (including Ireland) and vice-versa.  The Central Bank of Ireland and the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) in the UK are in intensive dialogue with firms who are impacted and it is important to note that not all firms are impacted and\/or impacted in the same way. The European regulatory system is formulating the supervisory guidance on the many issues raised by Brexit and the Central Bank of Ireland is heavily involved in the design of these policies through our participation in the SSM and the European Supervisory Authorities.  While many firms are moving forward with Brexit preparation plans, the final impact of Brexit on banks and insurers will depend on the outcome of the EU27-UK negotiations, with the nature and duration of transition arrangements an important factor in determining the speed of adjustment. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s preparation and contingency work is ongoing and continues to examine all possible scenarios and challenges, and is a key input into the whole of Government approach. As part of its contingency planning, the Department is engaged on an ongoing basis in examining the potential impacts of Brexit on the financial services sector and potential mitigants.  As part of this work the Department liaises with other Government Departments and Agencies who have responsibilities in this area, including Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.

For example, in the case of Project Glas, the recently announced project announced by PTSB to sell a portfolio of NPLs, officials were first briefed by the bank on the timing of the sale, and potential composition of the portfolio, in the week commencing 15th January. Officials in turn, briefed me on the matter on 19th January. <\/p>  <p>  As this information was commercially sensitive, and as I am obliged to comply with stock exchange disclosure and market abuse rules, I was not in a position to discuss it publicly at the time.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the regular engagement Department officials have with the banks, I myself have met recently with senior officials of some of the Irish retail domestic banks and intend holding similar meetings with the remaining banks in due course. At these meetings, loan sales were discussed, where relevant. The Deputy will be aware in this regard, that it is not appropriate for me to put any more facts into the public domain, over and above what the banks themselves have disclosed, as I must respect commercial\u00a0confidentiality and stock exchange disclosure rules.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that, in the case of PTSB, no loan has been sold yet and it won&rsquo;t be known how many loans will be sold for a number of months, nor the composition of these loans. In addition, it is not known to whom the loans will be sold. However, I want and expect PTSB to be transparent with their customers when it comes to this sale process as it evolves.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that there are no changes to the rights or obligations of a customer whose loan is sold by a bank. All terms and conditions attached to their mortgage contract remain in place. In addition, as credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated entities are required to comply with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), all protections under the CCMA are unchanged. The customer is in the exact same position as they were before their loan was sold. In relation specifically to restructured loans, including splits, any purchaser will be obliged to honour the terms of the restructure agreement, should such loans be included in the final sale. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the protections currently in place, I have made it clear that I am prepared to engage with Deputies from other\u00a0parties\u00a0in an effort to see if we can strengthen and enhance the protections, in a sensible manner, that are already\u00a0in place for mortgage holders. I would highlight in this regard the Bill that has been introduced by Deputy Michael McGrath which seeks to regulate credit agreement owners of mortgage loans and which has received Government support.<\/p>  <p>  For clarity, I should highlight for the Deputy that I cannot stop loan sales, even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks, which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally. These frameworks were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. Loan sales do not require my consent, though the banks are required to formally consult with me. In the case of the PTSB loan sale, the bank has not yet consulted with me but will do so in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700060#WRC03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":154,"content":"<p>Question No. 115 answered with Question No. 87.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":155,"content":"<p>Question No. 116 answered with Question No. 114.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700060#WRC03550"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[13937\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700060#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when a decision on the future of the local property tax will be made.","asker":"1280","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>I recently announced a review\u00a0of the Local Property\u00a0Tax (LPT)\u00a0which will look in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments.

The reduction of NPL's is also being given high priority at EU level with the Commission announcing their \"Action Plan to Tackle Non-Performing Loans in Europe\" in July 2017. The action plan calls upon various institutions including the Commission to take appropriate measures to further address the challenges of high NPL ratios in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland significant progress has been made across the banking sector in reducing the level of NPLs since the financial crisis. Despite this progress, the level of NPLs in the sector remains well above the European average of c.5% (of gross loans). Hence in recent years the SSM has tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge.<\/p>  <p>  Progress to date in reducing NPL's has been primarily achieved by customers engaging directly with their banks and agreeing a sustainable restructure which provides the customer with an achievable path out of arrears. However in recent times, loan sales as a last resort have also been a feature of the deleveraging process. This would be in cases where meaningful engagement has not been forthcoming or affordability is not evident and in recognition of the fact that the end of the road has been reached and achieving an acceptable NPL ratio will not be possible without loan sales.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Relationship Frameworks (RFs) the disposal of loans is a commercial decision for the management and Board of each individual institution and is not subject to Ministerial consent. I therefore do not have the power to stop a loan sale. These agreements are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally and they were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. While loan sales do not require my consent, banks are required to formally consult with me during the process.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to highlight that the contractual terms of borrowers remain in place post any loan sale. In addition, all the protection enjoyed by borrowers under the CCMA is unaffected. In relation to buy to let or BTL mortgages, it should be noted that the rights of tenants remain unchanged if they happen to live in a property connected to a loan sale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700060#WRC04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corporation Tax","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700060#WRC04750"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[13627\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700060#WRC04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated impact of proposed EU tax changes on his Department's estimates of Ireland's corporation tax revenues in 2018, 2019 and 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the recently published proposals from the Commission on taxation of certain digital activities.

Mr Barnier updated me on the progress made with the UK in advancing discussions on the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including an in-depth exchange on the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>Mr Barnier also provided an update to the EU27 Member States at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) on 20 March regarding the progress made with the UK in advancing discussions on the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including in relation to transition.  Ireland was represented at this meeting by Minister for European Affairs, Helen McEntee T.D. <\/p><p>I welcome that the terms reflected in the draft Withdrawal Agreement are fully consistent with the EU&rsquo;s objective of agreeing a transition period based on the status quo.  This is an approach that I have strongly advocated for in my bilateral contacts with EU partners.  A transition period based on the status quo will provide certainty and limit disruption for our citizens and businesses. Under such an arrangement the UK will be expected to continue to apply the full EU acquis.<\/p><p>As concerns the duration of such a transition, the Government agrees that in the interests of long term certainty, and to accelerate agreement on the future relationship agreement, it must be time bound.  This is the overall view of both the EU and of the UK.  Therefore a date of 31 December 2020 has been set for the end of the transition period and this has been reflected in the text of the draft Withdrawal Agreement.  This also takes account of the EU&rsquo;s budgetary processes and the fact that the current Multiannual Financial Framework will conclude at the end of 2020.  But equally, as the negotiations progress, the overriding objective on both sides must be to avoid any gaps and any cliff edge effects.

These applications are going through the normal checking, processing and security stages.<\/p>  <p>  The target turnaround time for applications made via the online passport application service is 10 working days plus postage.  The majority of online applications are currently being processed within 5 working days, well ahead of this target.  The award winning online service currently accommodates adult renewals and passport card applications and it is planned to further extend this service to other categories of renewals by the end of 2018.  I would urge applicants wishing to renew their passports, whether residing in Ireland or overseas, to avail of the online passport application service where possible.<\/p>  <p>  The average turnaround time for renewal applications submitted through Passport Express is currently 14 working days, one day ahead of the target turnaround time of 15 working days.  Other types of application submitted through Passport Express, such as first time applications or applications to replace lost, stolen or damaged passports take longer due to additional security checks.<\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks we had higher than average turnaround times for some categories of application owing to high application volumes and disruption caused by adverse weather conditions and the subsequent closure of the Dublin and Cork passport offices for 2 days.  However as outlined the turnaround times have considerably reduce and in many cases are now shorter than the published target times.  My Department continues to closely monitor the level of passport demand to ensure that all resources are effectively deployed.  Measures taken by the Passport Service include the recruitment of additional staff and the use of targeted overtime. <\/p>  <p>  The number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) staff permanently employed by my Department and assigned to the Passport Service stood at 322 at the beginning of the year.  This compares to 310 FTE staff assigned to the Passport Service at the same point last year.  This year, since these figures were released, over 20 additional permanent staff have started with the Passport Service. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, in order to respond to seasonal demands and application increases, the Passport Service received sanction for 220 Temporary Clerical Officers (&ldquo;TCOs&rdquo;) to be appointed to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork this year.  The vast majority of these TCOs are already in place with the remaining TCOs expected to be fully trained and in place by the end of March at the latest.  Targeted overtime for the Passport Service was also sanctioned to increase processing capacity. <\/p>  <p>  In managing increasing application volumes, my Department&rsquo;s approach has not been merely to recruit or assign additional staff but to continue to implement service improvements in order to provide an exceptional service and minimise the impact high application volumes have on turnaround times.  The Passport Reform Programme is delivering major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements.  The award winning online passport application service will continue to make a major contribution to the effective management of application volumes by allowing existing resources to be more effectively deployed within the Passport Service. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700062#WRE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700062#WRE02800"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[13603\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700062#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps he is taking along with EU and UN partners to bring a total cessation to the seven-year civil war in Syria; the steps he is taking to support humanitarian initiatives to help families and individuals in the worst affected districts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[14082\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700062#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the responses to the UN Security Council resolution on a UN-mandated truce, particularly in view of the appalling humanitarian tragedy in Ghouta.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 168 together.<\/p>  <p>  The situation in Syria remains of utmost concern.

Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  The recent increase in violence in Syria, in particular the vicious siege of Eastern Ghouta, underscores the extent to which an end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254.

As I have previously outlined, despite repeatedly stating its commitment to improving its human rights record, the Bahraini Government appears to be targeting those who express disagreement with or criticism of the Government.  A number of worrying developments suggest an increasingly restrictive attitude to those opposing or challenging the Government in any way.  Statements from the Bahraini Government on its commitment to safeguarding human rights enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution ring hollow when there are so many examples of violations of the most fundamental freedoms, including those of opinion and expression.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights issues and restrictions of civil liberties in Bahrain is regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities, including through the Bahraini Embassy in London and through Ireland&rsquo;s (non-resident) Ambassador to Bahrain.  Most recently, last month, officials from my Department met with the Ambassador of Bahrain and Embassy officials in Dublin, and raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain.   At the 32nd session of the Human Rights Council in June 2016, Ireland, on behalf of a cross-regional group of States, delivered a statement proposing possible objective criteria which could guide the Council when deciding how to act on emerging situations of concern.  These criteria included, among others, whether there has been a call for action by the UN Secretary General, the High Commissioner for Human Rights or a relevant UN organ, body or agency. <\/p>  <p>  These criteria, often referred to as the &lsquo;Irish objective criteria&rsquo; may offer a useful guide, to help decide, in an objective and non-selective manner, when it is appropriate and necessary for the Council to engage with a concerned State.  These same independent factors are also a valuable guide for States in assessing whether to bring a specific country to the attention of the Council by issuing for, example a statement on the matter at the Human Rights Council.   <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department raised ongoing human rights concerns with Bahrain in the context of its Universal Periodic Review, which took place in Geneva in May 2017, and more recently at the Human Rights Council in Geneva.  At the Human Rights Council session earlier this month, Ireland supported an EU statement under Item 4 (Human Rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention) which reiterated calls on Bahrain &ldquo;to maintain its commitments as to the respect of freedom of speech and human rights defenders.&rdquo;  Ireland also made reference to Bahrain in our national Item 4 statement.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Bahrain, and will continue to call on the Bahraini Government to make good on their stated commitment to make progress in the area of human rights.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Bahrain, and will continue to call on the Bahraini Government to make good on their stated commitment to make progress in the area of human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700063#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Investigations","counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700063#WRF00900"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[14081\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700063#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent of the engagement by the embassy in Mexico on the human rights situation relating to the recent Honduras election.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":287,"content":"<p>Diplomatic relations with Honduras are maintained through our Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York and our Embassy in Mexico is not accredited to Honduras.Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade have been closely monitoring developments in Honduras following elections which took place there on 26 November, 2017.

Concerns around these issues have led to significant tensions and even violence in recent years, which we have discussed in the Oireachtas.  The issues involved can be very complex and multifaceted.  There are many Christian denominations present, and their churches and traditional status and rights predate not only the foundation of Israel but even the former British Mandate, and go back to the Ottoman period or even earlier. Some European partners have historical and treaty links to various Christian denominations, and the Jordanian Government retains a role as guardians of the Muslim holy places.  Jerusalem is uniquely sensitive, and Israel&rsquo;s discriminatory treatment of Palestinians and their land rights under the occupation has meant that any proposed changes to the regime pertaining to religious properties are viewed with deep suspicion.I do not wish to comment on the specific issues which led to the brief closure as a protest of some of the Christian churches in Jerusalem last month.

During the height of the financial crisis a key focus of the authorities was on stabilising and ultimately reducing mortgage arrears through the implementation of sustainable mortgage solutions that were agreed with borrowers.  <\/p>  <p>  This led to the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) introducing public mortgage arrears resolution targets (MART) for the banks in H1 2013.  As the MART process was rolled out a split mortgage solution or a part capital and interest solution that met certain criteria were accepted by the CBI as being sustainable for the purposes of these targets. <\/p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in November 2014, the focus has shifted from reducing mortgage arrears levels to reducing Non-performing Loans (NPLs).  This shift in focus has been accompanied by a new strict definition Europe-wide of what constitutes an NPL by the European Banking Authority (EBA) which means that certain restructures are deemed NPL even if customers are meeting the revised payment schedule.  <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department met with staff of the SSM at the highest level on two occasions since late 2016.  In the course of their discussions they outlined the background and history to the restructuring effort in Ireland and questioned the logic of now classifying some types of restructured loans, including certain split mortgages, as NPL indefinitely. <\/p>  <p>  While my Department has been informed that the SSM is looking into the regulatory treatment of split mortgages across a number of European member states I have no evidence at this point that this categorisation is going to change.  <\/p>  <p>  Aside from direct interaction with the SSM, Department officials have also been actively involved in the discussions on NPLs through its involvement in the European Council&rsquo;s Financial Services Committee subgroup on NPLs, and the more recent European Commission Expert Group on NPLs.  While this has ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s views are voiced and considered on the matter, ultimately the final arbiter on the resolution of NPLs for the Irish banks is the SSM. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700063#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Financial Forum","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700063#WRF03400"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[7006\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700063#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on his Department's or his involvement in the European Financial Forum.","asker":"1238","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":313,"content":"<p>The third annual European Financial Forum (EFF) was held in Dublin Castle on 31 January 2018.

According to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, in 2017 the EU and euro area economies grew by 2.4 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively.  This would suggest that Ireland was the fastest growing economy in the EU in 2017.  While the 2017 outturn is based on preliminary quarterly data which is highly volatile and prone to revision, the numbers provide clear evidence of continued momentum in the economy.  Other indicators such as consumer spending, labour market trends and taxation receipts confirm Ireland&rsquo;s strong economic position. <\/p>  <p>  According to the European Commission, Ireland is also expected to be among the fastest growing economies in Europe this year and next.  The European Commission expects Ireland's economy to grow by 4.4 per cent in 2018 and 3.1 per cent in 2019.  This compares with growth of 2.3 per cent this year and of 2.0 per cent next year for the EU and the euro area respectively.  The Commission notes that consumer spending and construction investment are forecast to drive GDP growth in the short-term.  Strong employment growth, particularly for full-time jobs, should underpin a rise in disposable income and household consumption over the next two years. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will publish updated forecasts with the Stability Programme Update 2018 in April.  Given the strength of activity last year, growth forecasts for this year are likely to be revised upwards.<\/p>  <p>  However, economic challenges remain, mainly linked to the outcome of the negotiations between the EU and the UK and the potential changes to the international taxation and trading environments.  The best way to deal with the challenges we face, and to support continued economic growth, is through continued implementation of productivity-oriented policies along with sustainable public finances.

The impact of excessive premiums being charged to consumers from all over the country was a feature of this engagement process with industry. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department officials regularly raise specific issues affecting consumers during their ongoing engagement with Insurance Ireland, including within a sub-group formed to implement relevant consumer-focused recommendations from the Motor Report. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has separately\u00a0met with representatives from insurance companies and other relevant stakeholders in relation to a number of issues and the problems resulting from high insurance premiums have been\u00a0 discussed during these engagements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700064#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[13657\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700064#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when consumers will receive a detailed breakdown of their insurance quotes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":349,"content":"<p>The Deputy should note that there are two recommendations in the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance which specifically aim to provide consumers with more information in respect of their insurance premiums.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 2 requires insurers to provide additional information on the premium breakdown to consumers, such as setting out the element of the cost related to the mandatory motor insurance element (third party), in addition to the non-mandatory element (comprehensive).\u00a0 The Central Bank of Ireland conducted a public consultation to seek views from interested stakeholders on this recommendation. \u00a0This consultation process closed on 9 February last and subsequent amendments to provide for these changes will be made to the Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) Regulations (SI No. 74 of 2007). \u00a0This is on schedule to be completed by the end of Q2 2018, as per the set timeline.<\/p>  <p>  Pursuant to Recommendation 1, a protocol has been agreed between Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance which aims to explain how a premium is calculated and provides a list of reasons for large increases in premiums.\u00a0 The content of this document is now available on the websites of the major motor insurance providers and will also be provided to policyholders on renewal.<\/p>  <p>  The agreed document is not a bespoke document but consumers will be provided with contact details of their insurance provider in order to enable them to receive more specific information if they do not believe any of the listed reasons apply to their situation.\u00a0 The main reason why a bespoke document cannot be provided is because the complexity of the interaction between the customer-facing systems and the underwriting systems in all modern insurance companies would make it very difficult to delineate specific reasons for an individual premium increase.\u00a0 I am informed that if insurers were to try and link these systems in order to address this issue, it would require very significant IT infrastructural changes at considerable cost.

If the couple have children that are under 18, over 18 and in full-time education or incapacitated, \u00a0the exemption limits are increased by &euro;575 per child for the first two children and &euro;830 per child for any additional children.  However, this exemption threshold is reduced by the amount of any income that is not subject to PAYE.  This reduction includes any pension payments made by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This is to ensure that the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax based on their total income consisting of both PAYE and non-PAYE income.<\/p><p>- Where a taxpayer&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant threshold, tax is calculated in the normal manner on the full amount of income.  However, if the taxpayer&rsquo;s income is above the thresholds by a small amount, a further relief, known as &ldquo;marginal relief&rdquo; is available. Marginal relief operates by reducing the individual or couple&rsquo;s tax liability for a year of assessment to 40% of the amount by which their income exceeds the threshold.

During the height of the financial crisis\u00a0a key focus of the authorities was on stabilising and ultimately reducing mortgage arrears through the implementation of sustainable\u00a0mortgage solutions that were agreed with borrowers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This led to the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) introducing public mortgage arrears resolution targets (MART) for the banks in H1 2013.

This shift in focus has been accompanied by a new strict definition Europe-wide of what constitutes an NPL by the European Banking Authority (EBA) which means that certain restructures are deemed NPL even if customers are meeting the revised payment schedule. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department met with staff of the SSM at the highest level on two occasions since late 2016.

The Eurogroup&rsquo;s main task is to ensure close coordination of economic policies among the euro area member states and to promote conditions for stronger economic growth. <\/p>  <p>  At both the ECOFIN and Eurogroup meetings, Ministers of the Member States work alongside the European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) to take stock of the latest economic situation in the EU and euro area, including on the risks to the European economy&rsquo;s growth prospects. <\/p>  <p>  The European Semester was initiated in response to the crisis in 2010. It provides a framework for coordination of economic policies across the European Union in which guidance is provided to Member States before they take policy decisions at national level. The guidance is provided in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP). As part of the Semester process, the Commission makes country-specific recommendations to provide tailored policy guidance to each EU country on how to boost jobs and growth, while maintaining sound public finances.  Following the economic crisis, budgetary surveillance was enhanced with the 'Six-Pack' and 'Two-Pack' regulations which seek to complement the European Semester through enhanced monitoring and surveillance of the fiscal policies of EU Member States.  <\/p>  <p>  The European economy is performing well with growth exceeding expectations in 2017.  The latest estimates from Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, show that in 2017 the EU and euro area economies grew by 2.4 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively.  The upturn is increasingly broad-based across EU countries.  The recovery has been supported by a number of factors including sound macroeconomic policies, strong business and consumer confidence and a gradual improvement in world trade.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Autumn Economic Forecast 2017 highlights risks to the European economy as being broadly balanced.  Downside risks relate to the process of the UK leaving the EU, global geopolitical instability and potentially tighter global financial conditions.  While bank fragilities in the euro area have eased, low profitability and legacy issues (i.e. non-performing loans) remain a concern.  Other economic challenges relate to potential changes to the international taxation and trading environments.  On the upside, uncertainties have diminished, economic sentiment has improved and with the rebound outside Europe potentially leading to a stronger, more durable expansion in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Given the still high levels of unemployment and public and private debt across the EU, there are clearly no grounds for complacency.

The need for the project is beyond question as the City in particular suffers from regular flooding from both fluvial and tidal flood events with particularly severe events affecting the City in 2009, 2014 and the winter of 2015\/16.  The scheme has been brought through the formal Public Exhibition or statutory consultation process as required under the Arterial Drainage Acts and detailed reports were put into the public domain at the completion of that phase of the project in December 2017.  These reports (see <i>www.lowerleefrs.ie<\/i>) deal comprehensively with the issues raised during the above consultative process and set out categorically how the proposed scheme is the only viable solution to the flooding problem in the city.<\/p><p>Among the detailed reports completed during the Exhibition stage is one dealing with the option of constructing a tidal barrier.  The proposal of a tidal barrier put forward by others was considered in depth and is found to be unworkable for cost, navigational and environmental reasons as well as lacking upstream storage capacity in the likely future climate change scenario.  It is, however, technically possible to construct a barrier elsewhere, at either side of Great Island, but the estimated whole life cost of this of up to &euro;1.7 billion also makes it a non-viable option.  In light of the in-depth analysis on the tidal barrier option for Cork carried out by international experts, the position is that a tidal barrier is not a viable solution for Cork and cannot be considered further.<\/p><p>Like other similar projects, the scheme for Cork City as exhibited includes a drainage system to cater for both surface water drainage and groundwater behind the flood defences.  The pumping element will only be required to operate during periods of extremely high river levels, for short durations around high tide.  For the majority of the time, the gravity drainage system will operate as at present and the normal groundwater regime will not be altered.  Detailed design is currently ongoing to finalise the finer detail of the drainage system, but what is proposed does not differ in principle from the scheme exhibited.  The published Exhibition Reports deal with the groundwater aspects of the scheme.<\/p><p>During the development of the scheme, the OPW and its partners, Cork City and County Councils, were acutely conscious of the need to avoid disruption to the city during construction works.

Significant reforms have been made in recent years and have made the work of the public service more transparent, decision-making more accountable and service delivery more effective and efficient.<\/p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020, which I launched last December, is a new policy framework designed to build on these previous reforms while expanding the scope of reform to focus more on collaboration, innovation and evaluation.  I am confident that Our Public Service 2020 will contribute to the strengthening and further development of our economy over the period of its implementation.<\/p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020 is a whole-of-public-service initiative.  A Public Service Leadership Board comprising Secretary General and CEO level participants from across the civil and public service has been established to drive the reform agenda and lead on its implementation.  This approach will support and enable public servants and their organisations to perform at their best and to work together to deliver high-quality, value-for-money outcomes that will benefit the economy.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform I must ensure that our fiscal and public expenditure policy is prudent and sustainable.  There are a number of budgetary reforms introduced in recent years to guide my decisions on overall fiscal policy in this regard, including fiscal rules, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews.  The actions in Our Public Service 2020  will ensure that the focus of the public service is very much on delivery of quality public services, while operating within these prudent limits.<\/p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020  contains an added focus on evaluation and on the importance of building a reform evaluation culture.  The newly established Reform Evaluation Unit will work closely with units within my Department focused on performance budgeting and spending reviews to strengthen the links between expenditure and reform.  This will take place alongside the work of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) which leads a programme of evaluation of public service delivery across the public service.  A series of rolling, selective reviews, which will cover the totality of Government spending over a three-year period to 2019, started in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700065#WRH02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":415,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[13537\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700065#WRH02500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which reforms embraced by public administration in recent years years compare with reforms introduced in other competing EU or non-EU jurisdictions, with particular reference to enhancing this country's opportunities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":416,"content":"<p>In 2017, the OECD were commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to undertake a written evaluation of the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-16, with a view to informing future public service reform efforts.

The State buys everything from pens and paper, through to naval vessels and surgical equipment.  In this context, it is essential that the Public Service operates in a co-ordinated and efficient way and delivers much needed public services in a sustainable manner.  That is why the Government established the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).<\/p>  <p>  The OGP commenced operations in 2014 and, together with four key sectors (Health, Defence, Education and Local Government), has responsibility for sourcing goods and services on behalf of the Public Service.  In addition, the OGP also has responsibility for procurement policy and offers advice on procurement procedures.<\/p>  <p>  The OGP has progressed the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector by setting out the procurement procedures to be followed by public bodies.  Last July, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, launched new Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services.  This comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives has been designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules.  In addition, the OGP maintains a proactive line of communication with SME stakeholders to ensure they are informed of policy developments and that these are communicated by them to their members. <\/p>  <p>  The OGP together with four key sectors, speaks with &ldquo;one voice&rdquo; for the public service to the market for each category of expenditure, eliminating duplication and taking advantage of the scale of public procurement to best effect.

Staff employed on these schemes are paid directly by my Department and are not paid via grant funding.  The 1978 and 1979 schemes are being phased out and have been superseded by a more extensive capitation grant scheme. <\/p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services.  Capitation related grants are issued to the majority of primary and post-primary schools to employ such staff.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. <\/p><p>Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.  My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the above, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of school secretaries and caretakers who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries and caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is also being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 following the arbitration process.  These increases are in order to enable schools  implement the arbitration outcome for grant funded secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation. <\/p><p>In December 2017, my Department published circular letter 0078\/2017 for primary schools and circular letter 0079\/2017 for voluntary secondary schools, setting out the application of the third phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.

It also increases the range of possible sanctions for infringements of these standards and obligations.  At the heart of the GDPR is a &ldquo;risk-based&rdquo; approach to data protection.  This means that each data controller and data processor is required to put appropriate technical and organisational measures in place in order to ensure &ndash; and to be able to demonstrate &ndash; that their processing of personal data complies with the new data protection standards.<\/p>  <p>  The GDPR also imposes an obligation on data controllers and data processors involved in high risk processing to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) prior to the commencement of processing operations.  Where the DPIA indicates that risks identified in relation to the processing of personal data cannot be mitigated, the controllers and processors will be required to consult with the Data Protection Commission before engaging in the processing.<\/p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Data Protection Bill 2018 gives further effect to the GDPR in a number of areas in which the GDPR gives Member State a margin of flexibility.  During Seanad Report Stage, I tabled amendments to insert new sections 31 and 32 in the Bill, which will provide for increased protections for the personal data of children.  Section 31 provides that the Data Protection Commission will encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct intended to contribute to the proper application of the GDPR with regard to the following:<\/p>  <p>  (a) the protection of children,<\/p>  <p>  (b) the information to be provided by a controller to children,<\/p>  <p>  (c) the manner in which the consent of the holders of parental responsibility over a child is to be obtained for the purposes of Article 8 of the GDPR, and<\/p>  <p>  (d)  integrating the necessary safeguards into processing in order to protect the rights of children in an age-appropriate manner.<\/p>  <p>  Section 32 introduces a specific &ldquo;right-to-be-forgotten&rdquo; for children.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of Dublin Metropolitan Region (D.M.R) West Division on 31\u00a0January 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available,\u00a0was 667 of whom 64 are designated as Community Garda.\u00a0There are also\u00a026\u00a0Garda Reserves and\u00a053 Garda civilian staff\u00a0attached to the D.M.R. West Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. \u00a0<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 155 to the D.M.R. West Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also a further 600 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the remainder\u00a0of the\u00a0year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the D.M.R. West Division. <\/p><p>In relation to the number of &quot;Community Garda&iacute;\u00a0&quot; it is important to recognise that community policing is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official\u00a0categorisation as a &ldquo;Community\u00a0Garda&quot;\u00a0simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities including through the giving of talks to schools, community groups and others.\u00a0It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part\u00a0in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Overall the Model advocates\u00a0a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing. It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community. Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. <\/p><p>As part of the Community Policing Model An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with local communities, to prevent and deter crime through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, Text Alert and the Garda Schools Programme as well as through more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.<\/p><p>The Community Policing Model also places a strong emphasis on Crime Prevention and within each Garda Division, where\u00a0there are specialist Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs), who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention within communities. <\/p><p>In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community\u00a0Engagement Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.\u00a0<\/p><p>I have previously stated that I welcome the strong emphasis that the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places on\u00a0developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.\u00a0 It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District.\u00a0 In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Garda Executive for implementation.<\/p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have provided in tabular form, in the attached document, the total strength and Community Garda&iacute; strength of Blanchardstown, Lucan, Clondalkin and Finglas Garda Stations\u00a0as of 31 December 2012 to 31 January 2018 the latest date for which figures are readily available, as provided by the Commissioner.<table><tr><th colspan=\"3\"><div>2012<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Stations<\/td><td><div>Total Strength<\/div><\/td><td><div>Of whom are Community Garda&iacute;<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td><div>162<\/div><\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lucan<\/td><td><div>73<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td><div>95<\/div><\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td><div>117<\/div><\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><div>2013<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Stations<\/td><td><div>Total Strength<\/div><\/td><td><div>Of whom are Community Garda&iacute;<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td><div>162<\/div><\/td><td><div>16<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lucan<\/td><td><div>72<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td><div>91<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td><div>108<\/div><\/td><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><div>2014<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Stations<\/td><td><div>Total Strength<\/div><\/td><td><div>Of whom are Community Garda&iacute;<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td><div>156<\/div><\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lucan<\/td><td><div>74<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td><div>89<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td><div>108<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><div>2015<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Stations<\/td><td><div>Total Strength<\/div><\/td><td><div>Of whom are Community Garda&iacute;<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td><div>154<\/div><\/td><td><div>13<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lucan<\/td><td><div>73<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td><div>87<\/div><\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td><div>106<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><div>2016<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Stations<\/td><td><div>Total Strength<\/div><\/td><td><div>Of whom are Community Garda&iacute;<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td><div>143<\/div><\/td><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lucan<\/td><td><div>74<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td><div>94<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td><div>106<\/div><\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><div> 2017<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Stations<\/td><td><div>Total Strength<\/div><\/td><td><div>Of whom are Community Garda&iacute;<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td><div>163<\/div><\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lucan<\/td><td><div>70<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td><div>97<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td><div>99<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><div>2018*<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Stations<\/td><td><div>Total Strength<\/div><\/td><td><div>Of whom are Community Garda&iacute;<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td><div>161<\/div><\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lucan<\/td><td><div>70<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td><div>95<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td><div>98<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*Up to 31 January 2018  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700070#WRN00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Data","counter":652,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700070#WRN01300"},{"type":"question","counter":653,"qnumday":309,"qnumall":"[13855\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700070#WRN01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of marked and unmarked Garda cars and vans in the Dublin region that were scrapped in 2017 due to the fact they exceeded 300,000 km mileage and or exceeded ten years of age;

The manufacturer, CSL Behring, was notified in August 2017 that the HSE was unable to recommend reimbursement.

Following interventions by the HSE, the company modified its decision and agreed to continue to supply the medication free of charge for the patients on the access scheme for a further six months, or until the next clinical trial commences in mid 2018, but stipulated that it would not cover the cost of administering the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the critical and exceptional circumstances, the HSE decided to facilitate a transitional arrangement, under which it would fund the necessary nursing service to ensure that patients would continue to receive the medicine until a new clinical trial commences in 2018.

(Statutory Instrument No. 675 of 2006).\u00a0 Live exports are an important component of Ireland&rsquo;s livestock industry and my Department promotes an\u00a0environment in which live exports take place with a strong emphasis on the welfare of all animals being exported. A considerable amount of resources is deployed to the process of certifying animals for export and in ensuring compliance in respect of the welfare of the animals being exported. \u00a0My Department is regularly in contact with the Competent Authorities in other Member States through which live animals pass  en route to their final destination. The purpose of these contacts is to ensure that the regulations in place regarding rest, feed and water are obeyed regardless of the location of the animals or the transport vehicle or vessel. For instance, where transporters are suspected of failing to obey the regulations on the protection of live animals during transport in Ireland or other Member States, there is a system in place for official notifications to the Member State of origin of the journey and the Member State where the transporter is authorised. \u00a0Any such official notifications are investigated and where there are non-compliances appropriate sanctions are applied to the transporters and organisers of the journey.\u00a0In terms of the issue raised concerning the\u00a0export of calves on a replacement ship, there are strict arrangements in place with the shipping companies engaged in transporting animals, to ensure adequate oversight of the animals when in transit.\u00a0My Department is satisfied that these arrangements are working in a satisfactory manner and that the welfare of the calves is not compromised.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the incident leading to the death of calves in the Netherlands, this appears to result from an unfortunate road traffic accident. The Dutch authorities are \u00a0investigating the circumstances of the accident. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to promote and maintain an\u00a0environment in which live exports can continue in both an economic and sustainable manner and with due regard for the welfare of all animals exported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700078#WRV04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":1113,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700078#WRV04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1114,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[13895\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700078#WRV05000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of cows and calves killed at a location (details supplied) during Storm Emma; the recommendations he will make in relation to such sites funded by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1115,"content":"<p>Teagasc are involved in 4 demonstration farms with industry partners to highlight best practice in livestock production in terms of animal breeding, grassland management, animal health and financial management. Teagasc provide strategic oversight in the form of business planning and technical support and also organise farm walks and visits etc. My Department does not directly aid the operation of these farms. <\/p>  <p>  The Greenfield Dairy Farm project was set up in 2010 to demonstrate\u00a0best practise in the design, construction and operation of sustainable grass based milk production systems to Irish dairy farmers. Glanbia, the Agricultural Trust and the farm owners, formed a limited company (Greenfield Dairy Partners Limited), which leased the farm from the\u00a0owners for a 15-year period. Teagasc\u00a0 are not involved in the day-to-day operations on the farm. <\/p>  <p>  Like many other farms,\u00a0Greenfield\u00a0was impacted by the extreme weather associated with Storm Emma. Farm\u00a0staff stayed on the farm for the entire duration of the storm to monitor the stock under the adverse conditions.\u00a0Additional help was brought in to\u00a0ensure that all animals were provided with adequate feed and water, which is the main animal welfare priority in such situations. <\/p>  <p>  Out of a total of 370 cows, there were 290 cows on the farm during the storm. In preparation for the storm, approximately 80 in-calf cows and 30 calves were moved to a nearby farmyard which provided more sheltered accommodation.

The National Transport Authority, NTA, has statutory responsibility for the development of public transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area, GDA, including traffic management.  As the Deputy is aware, the NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services for Dublin over the next two decades.  Addressing urban congestion on both the strategic road network and locally in certain locations is an important theme in the strategy.  The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.<\/p>  <p>  NTA and DCC jointly published the Dublin City Centre Transport Study in 2015 which sets out the various measures proposed for Dublin's city centre to ensure the efficient functioning of transport within the city centre.  In preparing the study, Dublin City Council and the NTA reviewed the current and future transportation needs of the city centre, and the report noted that as the economy continues its recovery and employment rises, without positive intervention, increased congestion and longer journey times on the key routes to Dublin City, and within the city centre itself, will become an increasing feature of the city.  The report also\u00a0acknowledged that with the introduction of the Luas cross city project, Luas trams would be caught up in traffic congestion, and that the service reliability would be prone to disruption due to general traffic.  Similarly the report also acknowledged the impact to the reliability of the bus network given the interaction with other road traffic.  The report recognised that\u00a0a rebalancing of the available road space will be required on various streets to facilitate the introduction of additional capacity for public transport, cycling and walking.  Significant changes to the traffic network in the city centre will be necessary, with the objective of guaranteeing that the overall transport system is capable of operating efficiently and reliably, with consistent journey times.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  NTA and DCC, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, are progressively implementing the measures set out in that document to enable the continued development and growth of the city with the objective of guaranteeing that the overall transport system is capable of operating efficiently and reliably, with consistent journey times.  As the Deputy is aware, the City Council's College Green plaza\u00a0proposal is currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for determination, and if approved, would remove a lot of the conflicting traffic movements that currently exist in College Green.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Looking to the future, as Minister for Transport I have ensured that Budget 2018 increased the multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period, including providing an enhanced capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion for a multi-modal public transport investment programme between 2018 and 2021. \u00a0The 4 year envelope will allocate investment to\u00a0fund projects such as BusConnects, MetroLink, DART expansion, will continue investment in Dublin's light rail network, cycling and walking and traffic management measures in our capital and beyond.  These programmes will be implemented by the NTA which has statutory responsibility for development of Public Transport in the GDA. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Furthermore, Government&rsquo;s Public Transport investment priorities are also set out in the recently published National Development Plan, NDP.  The NDP seeks to protect the quality and value of the existing assets and\u00a0 deliver a multi-modal public transport network that will provide high-quality passenger interchange points, which facilitate convenient transfer between efficient and integrated public transport services.  All the planned investment in public transport combined will add greatly to the choice and experience of the travelling public, connecting more people with more places and ease congestion in Ireland&rsquo;s cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700081#WRY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety Authority Data","counter":1228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700081#WRY01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1229,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[13612\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700081#WRY01700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 195 of 28 February 2018, the details of the additional fields in the electronic traffic incident record;

Appeals were accepted where the appellant demonstrated that the Department erred in its decision to make the application invalid, or where it was agreed that the Department's own guide to making an application was not sufficiently clear,\u00a0or where it was felt the original decision involved an overly strict interpretation of the SCP terms and conditions.<\/p>  <p>  All\u00a0organisations that submitted an invalid or partially invalid application were contacted offering them the opportunity to submit an appeal and all of the appellants have now been informed of the results of the appeal process.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to future rounds of the SCP, my Department is now undertaking a general review of the 2017 round with a view to making recommendations on how to improve the process for future calls.  This work is also examining what is feasible in terms of the scale and timing of the next round.\u00a0 I expect this review to be complete shortly\u00a0and an announcement regarding the next round\u00a0of the SCP will\u00a0be made at that stage.  All applicants under the 2017 round of the programme that remain invalid have\u00a0been informed that they will be given the\u00a0opportunity of simply submitting corrected documentation when the next round of the programme opens without the requirement of submitting a\u00a0full new application.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700082#WRZ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1318"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700082#WRZ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1268,"qnumday":533,"qnumall":"[13977\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700082#WRZ00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the capital allocation for his Department in each of the years 2019 to 2023; the areas in which this spend will be made in each of these years; the particular projects and particular areas of investment involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1333","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1269,"content":"<p>The Capital Allocation for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the years 2018 to 2022 can be found in the recently published <b>National Development Plan 2018-2027<\/b>.<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>The plan also discusses the key projects and programmes that will be our focus over the coming years.<\/p><p><b>Capital Allocation<\/b><table><tr><th>2018<\/th><th>2019<\/th><th>2020<\/th><th>2021<\/th><th>2022<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,327<\/td><td>1,643<\/td><td>2,058<\/td><td>2,526<\/td><td>2,405<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In my Budget Speech\u00a02018, I\u00a0have\u00a0listed the priorities and programmes within\u00a0my Department for 2018 and provided information on how the Capital\u00a0allocations will be spent.<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>As set out in the Government's recently published National Development Plan, as part of the annual Estimates process, the multi-annual capital allocations will be reviewed and extended annually on a rolling basis to cover the coming 5 year period.\u00a0 This will provide Government with an annual opportunity to review the allocations in light of any implementation issues arising and\/or new priorities which may emerge as the National Development Plan is implemented.\u00a0 The NDP also commits to a full mid-term review of the National Development Plan in 2022, to allow Government to take stock of progress in terms of delivery of the planned projects and programmes, and to allow Government to review and reaffirm its investment priorities.

The Act also proposes (by way of the insertion of a new Part IVA) a substantial amendment to the Child Care Act 1991 creating a legislative framework within which special care procedures can be governed. <\/p>  <p>  Under the new provisions the High Court may make a special care order where it is satisfied that the child has attained 11 years of age and that the\u2009child's behaviour poses a real and substantial risk of harm to his or her life, health, safety, development or welfare and where the provision of continued care other than special care and treatment\/services under the Mental Health Act 2001 is not adequate to address the therapeutic requirements of the child. <\/p>  <p>  The High Court has discretion regarding the requirement for a consultation procedure with parents and their child and in relation to the requirement for a family welfare conference prior to the granting of the order.

The setting of retirement age remains a matter for agreement between employers\/employees and the employment contract. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Government believes that labour market practices should evolve to reflect the reality that as people live longer and healthier lives, many people wish to, and can, work longer and make a positive contribution through their work to our society. <\/p>  <p>  This is why the recently launched &lsquo;Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023&rsquo; confirms future commitments on top of a range of actions already taken to support a positive ageing environment, where older people are, to the greatest extent possible, encouraged and facilitated in participating in the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  To this end, and with the input of the social partners, the Workplace Relations Commission recently published a &lsquo;Code of Practice on Longer Working&rsquo;.  The code informs best practice in managing the engagement between employers and employees in the run up to retirement.  This includes requests to work beyond what might be considered the &lsquo;normal retirement age&rsquo; in the employment concerned.  Following publication of this code, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will now prepare and publish guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is determined that the provisions detailed in the Roadmap for Pensions Reform will combine to result in greater employee flexibility in the retirement decision.  To ensure this is the case, employment practices in this area will be kept under close review in the near term.  Should it appear that these provisions are not resulting in improved flexibility for workers by the end of 2018, the Government will actively consider measures to restrict the capacity to use mandatory retirement provisions relative to the prevailing State pension age.  To this end an Interdepartmental Group chaired by my Department will be convened to review practices in this area.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700084#WRBB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Registration Legislation","counter":1374,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700084#WRBB01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1375,"qnumday":576,"qnumall":"[13588\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700084#WRBB01400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a matter (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1376,"content":"<p>The provisions for registering the name of a father, other than the person to whom the mother is married, are contained in section 22(3) of the Civil Registration Act 2004 (as amended):<\/p><p>- Section 22(3)(a) provides for the registration of a person, other than the husband, as the father of the child on foot of a statutory declaration by the husband that he is not the father of the child.<\/p><p>- Section 22(3)(b) provides for the registration of a person, other than the husband, as the father of the child on foot of a statutory declaration by the mother that she has been living apart from her husband by virtue of a decree of divorce, a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro<\/i>, a decree of nullity or a deed of separation.<\/p><p>There is also provision in section 22(2)(d) that allows for the registration of a person, other than the mother&rsquo;s husband, on foot of a Court under section 45 of the Status of Children Act 1987.<\/p><p>These are the only provisions that allow for the registration of anyone other than the mother&rsquo;s husband as the father of the child. <\/p><p>I can further update the Deputy, by way of information, that section 6(1) of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 amends section 22 to provide for registration of a person, other than the mother&rsquo;s husband, as the father of the child where there is no decree of divorce, decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro<\/i>, decree of nullity or deed of separation.

Instead, the Department will invite pensioners, who were assessed under the current rate bands in place since 2012, to have their pensions recalculated under TCA to determine if they qualify for a higher rate of entitlement.  However legislation has to be drafted and enacted to enable implementation of these arrangements and IT solutions in line with this legislation must be developed.

As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  <\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  <\/p><p>Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p><p>In addition, a number of new appeals officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff led to longer times to conclude appeals in 2017 and this has continued in the first two months of 2018.

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to assess the specific cost of State pension (contributory) to those affected by the implementation of the provision as it is not possible to identify these &ldquo;assisting relatives&rdquo;.   They make a normal Class S self-employed contribution and qualify for social welfare entitlements on that basis.  However, at the time of the introduction of the provision, numbers affected were thought to be relatively small.  Census 2011 data suggested that prior to the change, the exclusion from social insurance affected less than 6,000 assisting spouses\/civil partners who assist in family businesses.  The 2011 data indicated that there were 5,872 &ldquo;assisting relatives&rdquo; of which 3,315 were female and 2,557 were male.  Some of these &ldquo;assisting relatives&rdquo; could have been family members other than spouses\/civil partners.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, many spouses\/civil partners who were affected by the exclusion from social insurance and who gained access to State pension contributory in their own right, may already have been entitled to the means tested increase for a qualified adult.

The scheme commenced operation in 2011 as a response to the high level of unemployment and the large numbers on the Live Register at that time.  There are 47 Local Development Companies (LDCs), as well as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, involved in the delivery of the T&uacute;s programme - known as Implementing bodies (IBs).<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.

The service was launched in 2015 on a &lsquo;rolling basis&rsquo; with referral numbers gradually increasing over time.  The aim of the service is to assist persons who are long term unemployed to find and sustain full-time paid employment in the open labour market.  The service assists long-term unemployed people through the provision of career advice, CV preparation support, interview skills training, job search supports and by working closely with employers to source vacancies that can be offered to jobseekers.  <\/p>  <p>  The service is distinct from the CE and T&Uacute;S schemes which provide part- time work experience and training opportunities as stepping stones back to employment for people on a range of Social Welfare payments.  These schemes do not provide full-time sustainable employment in the open labour market.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there are two phases to the JobPath service.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, a personal advisor (PA) provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.  The duration of the client journey therefore necessitates the requirement of a cohort based approach to reporting and the updating of individual cohort outcome data over time, as amd when more jobseekers complete their engagement period with the service.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has published initial cohort based reports on the performance of the service, with the latest being published on welfare.ie in January 2018.  This report detailed employment outcomes for customer cohorts referred in Quarter 3 and 4 in 2015 and those referred in Quarter 1 and 2 in 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  Of the 39,603 jobseekers referred to the service during this period, 58% were over three years unemployed and a further 17% were over two years unemployed.  These groups face significant barriers when seeking to enter or return to employment in the open labour market.<\/p>  <p>  The total employment outcome across all four cohorts at the time of publishing was 25%: 18% of Jobseekers who engaged with the service during this period obtained full-time employment, in addition a further 4% of clients entered part-time employment and a further 3% became self-employed.  It is important to note, that the latter two cohorts (Q1 and Q2 2016), represent 80% of the 39,603 jobseekers referred between July 2015 and June 2016, and the employment outcomes are expected to improve over time as more  jobseekers from these cohorts complete their full engagement period with the service.<\/p>  <p>  The figures presented for JobPath provided by the Deputy are misconceived as they do not correctly relate to the service and as they seek to compare the service and the participation costs for other schemes, this is to misunderstand the service.  However taking the deputies approach, the cost per jobseeker supported by the service in the period between July 2015 and June 2016, can be estimated by taking the numbers who participated during the period (circa 39,600 jobseekers) and the payments from the Department during the same period (which amounted to approximately &euro;11.6m) giving a cost per participant of approximately &euro;300. <\/p>  <p>  The actual cost of the service, over the term of the contract, will be determined by a combination of factors such as, the profile of jobseekers on the live register, the number of people who are referred to the service by the Department and critically, the number of Jobseekers who are successfully placed into sustainable full time paid employment. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the quoted amounts paid in fees to JobPath providers to date are gross figures i.e. the associated savings in social welfare payments have not been deducted.  This is a key feature of a payment by results model of contracting which has been undertaken with regards to JobPath: i.e. job sustainment fee payments are only made were a jobseeker has obtained and sustained paid employment of 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks duration were the former jobseeker was not entitled to a jobseekers related payment during that period. <\/p>  <p>  Given the extended time a Jobseeker may engage with the service and the increase in referral numbers over the reported timeframe the results are positive.  These initial cohort reports are however subject to review and are based on a relatively small sample size.  With this in mind, the department is undertaking an econometric review of this strand of its activation services.  Completion of the review is provisionally scheduled for the end of Q3 2018, following which more detailed and robust statistics will be available.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700085#WRCC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"T&uacute;s Programme","counter":1451,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700085#WRCC04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1452,"qnumday":602,"qnumall":"[14075\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700085#WRCC04100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will address queries (details supplied) with regard to extending T&uacute;s participation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1453,"qnumday":611,"qnumall":"[14168\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700085#WRCC04200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the rationale for the one year limit a person can spend on T&uacute;s; her plans to extend this to two years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1454,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 602 and 611 together.<\/p><p>T&uacute;s is one of a range of supports provided by my Department to cater for long-term unemployed jobseekers and those most distant from the labour market.

Up to 10 years ordinary credits (e.g. for Jobseekers or Illness Benefit) may also be used, subject to the total number of HomeCaring and ordinary credits not exceeding 20 years.

The Department was careful in designing the service to ensure that payments to contractors are conditional on Jobseekers not just finding a job but finding and sustaining their employment.  The companies are, for example, only paid a job outcome fee for each 13 week period of sustained employment of at least 30 hours per week.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that jobseekers are supported by the service for up to 30 months and as such the duration of the client journey necessitates the requirement of a cohort based approach to reporting in order to produce accurate outcome data.

The main purpose of these changes was to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme. <\/p>  <p>  The changes   for those on the live register see the general qualifying age for CE reduced from 25 to 21 years and are effective from 3rd July 2017.  It will also be easier for previous participants who have exhausted their CE entitlement to requalify as participation prior to the year 2007 will be disregarded.  While participants between 21 and 55 years can avail of one year on the programme, this can be extended on approval by the Department by up to 2 more years, if they are working towards a major award\/industry recognised equivalent to support their progression to employment.  CE participants aged 55 and over can now avail of up to 3 consecutive years on a scheme.  An overall lifetime limit of 6 years will apply to CE participants (7 years if on a disability payment).  A person may re-qualify for CE after 12 months of being in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, provided they have not reached their 6 year limit. All CE places are now categorised into one of two strands, either activation, with a target progression of 50%, or social inclusion, with a target progression of 20%. <\/p>  <p>  The rural social scheme (RSS) provides opportunities for farmers and fishermen\/women who are currently in receipt of specified social welfare payments to work to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing this valuable work in their local communities<\/p>  <p>  Since 1st February 2017, all participants commencing on the RSS have to be over 25 years of age and a 6 year overall participation limit on the work scheme also applies.  This new measure ensures that places become available to provide opportunities for other farmers and fishermen to take part in the scheme. RSS participants who commenced on the scheme prior to 1st February 2017 will remain on the scheme, as long as they continue to remain eligible for the scheme.  To be eligible to participate on the RSS, an individual must satisfy the qualifying criteria for the scheme.  This includes having an entitlement to one of the qualifying social welfare payments and maintaining an underlying entitlement to Farm\/Fish Assist.  <\/p>  <p>  T&uacute;s provides part-time temporary work in the communities, as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a long term jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  T&uacute;s participants work for an average of 19&frac12; hours a week and placements last for maximum of 12 months. The twelve month duration of the T&uacute;s contract is set to reflect a number of inter-related elements. These include the need to ensure the benefit of participation on a work scheme is available to the widest possible number of jobseekers . After three years, a person can become eligible for a further 12 month placement on T&uacute;s.  <\/p>  <p>  JobPath providers arrange for the delivery of a broad range of education and training courses with a particular strong focus on upskilling the long term unemployed. In order to support JobPath providers to refer people to training and education, the Department will extend the initial 12 month JobPath referral period by the duration of any externally delivered approved training course. This can be up to an additional 26 weeks.

This was evident in the Social Housing Output indicative figures published in January, showing nearly 26,000 households had their social housing need met in 2017.

Cost rental is new to Ireland and a number of pilot cost rental projects are currently being progressed in Dublin, for example, at Enniskerry Road and in Lusk.

Irish Standard 440: 2009\/A1:2014 Timber Frame Construction, Dwellings and other Buildings (I.S. 440) specifies requirements for materials, design, manufacture, construction details, site work and quality control for platform timber frame construction.  It requires that the responsibilities for the tasks involved in the planning, structural design, site erection and inspection be agreed and recorded prior to the commencement of each project.  I.S. 440 also gives specific details relating to fire, including the construction of separating walls, horizontal and vertical fire stopping, cavity barriers and detailed fire stopping junctions for walls and floors and service penetrations.<\/p><p>I.S. 440 is currently under review and it is intended that both external and party wall new constructions and methods will be included in the next revision of the document.

In the case of a building containing flats or apartments, this may, for example, be an Owners Management Company. <\/p><p>Local fire authorities have powers of inspection, and where necessary enforcement, under the Building Control Act 1990 and the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003. <\/p><p>Typically, in carrying out inspections under the Fire Services Acts, some or all of the following aspects will be reviewed &ndash; <\/p><p>- The passive or inbuilt fire safety features in a building, such as the layout and escape routes from the building and the construction of the building; the required passive fire safety features relating to the use of the building and the scale and occupancy;<\/p><p>- The active fire safety features, such as fire detection and alarm systems, which alert persons on the premises to the danger of fire and enable them to use the means of escape;<\/p><p>- The management of the building, including management of fire safety, to prevent fires occurring in the first place and to manage building services and fire safety to ensure that safety is not compromised. <\/p><p>Guidance on these features is generally set out in relevant guidance documents and codes of practice rather than in specific legislation or regulation.  My Department has published guidance documents and codes of practice for a range of building types. <\/p><p>A fire authority may require a &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; over a building, or an owner or occupier of such a building, to carry out a fire safety assessment of such building and to notify the fire authority of such assessment.  In such instances, the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; over a building may engage professional advisors to carry out these inspections and to assist with discharging their statutory duties; however, ultimate responsibility for fire safety in the building remains with the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo;. <\/p><p>In August 2017, my Department published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings, where concerns arise.

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important objective of the Government and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard. <\/p><p>Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 are targeted to be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies\u00a0(AHBs)\u00a0under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources, including 3,500 homes targeted using the Repair and Lease Scheme (RLS), and 6,500 homes using a\u00a0 combination of the existing social housing leasing arrangements, and the new Enhanced\u00a0Lease\u00a0Scheme.  All homes delivered under leasing arrangements, including a new Enhanced Leasing Scheme, will be funded under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).\u00a0 <\/p><p>The new Scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available.  There are, however, a number of key differences between the existing long term lease and the enhanced lease, the purpose of which is to facilitate larger levels of private investment in social housing while ensuring that the capital investment is off balance sheet in respect of Government expenditure. <\/p><p>Under the existing long term lease agreement, the owner retains responsibility for the structural maintenance on the property.  However, the day to day management and maintenance of the property, e.g. leaking pipes, broken heating etc., is carried out by the local authority or AHB.  Under the enhanced lease arrangement, the owner is responsible for both structural maintenance and day to day repairs.  This is one of the fundamental differences between the enhanced lease and the existing arrangement and is one of the features of the lease that determined the CSO and EUROSTAT classification of the enhanced lease as an &ldquo;operating&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;finance&rdquo; lease, and therefore off-balance sheet. <\/p><p>The owner will be paid up to 95% of the market rate - as opposed to 80% (85% for apartments) under the existing lease agreements.  This reflects the reduced responsibility of the local authority in relation to maintenance of the property under this type of contract as compared to standard long term leasing.  The local authority will retain the differential rent paid by the tenant. <\/p><p>The market rent must be evidenced by a valuation prepared by a qualified valuer and each valuation must refer to 3 comparable properties in the locality as evidence of the market rent for the property.  Rent reviews will be carried out every 3 years, linked to the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).  The term of the enhanced lease is 25 years, rather than the 10-20 year term under the existing agreements.<\/p><p>Local authorities will determine the suitability of the proposed properties, having regard to the standard of the properties, the requirement for social housing in the area and the criteria set out in each authority&rsquo;s Development Plans, including, in particular, sustainable communities considerations. <\/p><p>The scheme will be governed by my Department and operated by local authorities.  It will be funded through my Department's SHCEP.

Funding of &euro;200 million was originally provided under LIHAF, of which &euro;150 million is funded by the Exchequer and local authorities fund &euro;50 million. Further funding was made available as part of Budget 2018, bringing the total fund to &euro;266 million and there will be a second call for proposals in order to allocate the additional funds.<\/p>  <p>  The total cost of the 34 projects which received preliminary approval under LIHAF in March 2017 was &euro;226 million.  When approving proposals, it was considered prudent to approve in excess of &euro;200 million available at the time to allow for instances where a proposal does not proceed due to planning issues or unforeseen delays or where potential savings are secured through tendering or other efficiencies.<\/p>  <p>  As required under the scheme criteria and conditions, a key focus has been to ensure that there is a proportionate dividend for the State&rsquo;s investment in infrastructure, as demonstrated by either provision of housing at scale at certain prices, a proportionate reduction in house prices across all of the homes being facilitated or a specified number of homes which will benefit from a larger price reduction.  <\/p>  <p>  To date, I have given final approval for 30 of the 34 original projects under LIHAF, which will activate supply of almost 20,000 housing units on previously inactive sites, and grant agreements in respect of those projects have been signed.  The cost of these projects is &euro;195.7 million, of which &euro;146.7 million will be funded by my Department and &euro;49 million will be funded by local authorities.  The remaining four projects are being moved for consideration under LIHAF 2 later in 2018.

It is expected that this will increase substantially in 2018 as projects move to the construction stage.  Funding for LIHAF is ring-fenced within the overall housing budget and will be available for local authorities to drawdown over the lifetime of the projects involved.

In 2006, with the co-operation of the landowners, my Department commissioned a full survey of the then known togher (constructed of planks) followed by the excavation of a single cutting across the togher.  \u00a0During the course of this excavation, a second togher (of brushwood construction) was identified slightly to the north of the plank togher and running parallel to it.  This was also surveyed and recorded. <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the landowners commissioned an environmental impact statement in connection with a peat extraction licence application to the Environmental Protection Agency.  As part of the assessment process, the peatlands were fully examined by a qualified archaeological consultant and, aside from the plank togher, no further finds or features of archaeological significance were identified at that time. <\/p>  <p>  In 2014, at my Department&rsquo;s request, another inspection was commissioned by the landowners to assess the status of both toghers.  During 2015, and also at the request of my Department, the landowners commissioned a series of excavations which were carried out at three separate locations on both toghers. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, with the permission of the landowners, my Department commissioned an Induced Polarisation Survey (an advanced geophysical technique) to examine an area of high bog to the east of the open industrial bog at Mayne.  This methodology was previously used successfully at Edercloon, County Longford, to identify wooden structures outside the road corridor where other parts of the structures were under excavation by the National Roads Authority.  \u00a0Due to the heavily waterlogged nature of the high bog at Mayne, the geophysical survey was inconclusive in tracking the togher into the higher peatlands.  During 2017, my Department commissioned a further survey using metal probes inserted through the peat, as developed and employed successfully in research at C&eacute;ide Fields in North Mayo.  \u00a0The survey successfully identified that the togher continues to the east from the edge of the high bog for a minimum distance of 200 metres at depths from the surface varying from 1 to 2.4 metres. <\/p>  <p>  All the information referred to will assist in the protection and preservation of these toghers.  In that context, my Department is continuing to engage with all stakeholders, including the local authority and the landowners, to progress the preservation of the togher in the high bog. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the measures being taken with regard to the protection of the toghers uncovered at Mayne represent the best approach to securing an optimal outcome.  Unlike cases involving delivery of key infrastructure which are supported by the Codes of Practice agreed and in place between my Department and the various State utility providers, archeological discoveries arising from private development have to be dealt with on a case by case basis.  In such instances, the practice is to seek the co-operation of private landowners with the protection and recording of monuments in line, for example, with my Department&rsquo;s engagement with farmers under GLAS, the current agri-environmental scheme.  Such engagement is undertaken in a collaborative and transparent manner and I am satisfied that it is proving to be the best mechanism for guaranteeing the preservation of these monuments into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700088#WRFF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ferry Services","counter":1612,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700088#WRFF04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1613,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[14103\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032700088#WRFF04500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if her Department will conduct a review of the decision to remove the contract from a company (details supplied) that operates a ferry service to and from Tory Island; if her Department will consult with the community of Tory Island in order to ascertain their opinions on the type of service that should operate on the island; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1614,"content":"<p>The contract with Turasmara is a five year contract, which expires on 31 March 2018.
