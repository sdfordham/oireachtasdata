There are currently more than 28,500 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 20,000 landlords or agents currently in receipt of HAP payments. A weekly average of\u00a0350 HAP tenancies have been set up during 2017.<\/p>  <p>  HAP is also an essential component of our suite of homelessness prevention and supports. The Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE). The focus of this pilot scheme is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies. A Place Finder service, similar to the service available in Dublin, became operational in Cork City Council earlier this year and provides a\u00a0dedicated resource that\u00a0operates together with the established HAP delivery team in the local authority. The Cork Placefinder Service seeks potential properties suitable for households currently identified as homeless by Cork City Council by establishing relationships with local property agents and landlords and liaising with\u00a0individual households to establish their specific needs; and also supports homeless households in securing the tenancy arrangements which may include assisting with tenancy agreements and arrangements in that context. More than 2,000 formerly homeless households are currently having their housing needs met through this targeted support.  On average, 33 homeless households each week in the Dublin region alone are securing rental accommodation as a result of the additional supports available through the dedicated Place Finder Service. <\/p>  <p>  I announced recently that the Place Finder support is to be rolled out nationally providing homeless support staff in each of the 31 local authorities with the tools to target HAP supported rental properties for homeless households, with a particular focus of moving families out of emergency accommodation. This means that every local authority will be able to pay deposits and advance rental payment on behalf of homeless households in order to secure accommodation.  The existing Place Finder service in Dublin is also being enhanced, with\u00a0additional staff\u00a0to be assigned to provide on the ground support in each of the relevant \u00a0local authority areas.

The resulting increase in supply on both private and public lands is key to tackling price and affordability as the lack of supply is one of the main factors currently inflating house prices.<\/p>  <p>  As required under the LIHAF scheme's criteria and conditions, local authorities were asked, inter alia, to obtain commitments from housing providers on associated sites in relation to housing delivery timelines and cost reductions.\u00a0 Local authorities were asked to ensure that an agreed cost reduction was included in the agreements on the approved sites to ensure that there is a proportionate dividend for the State&rsquo;s investment in infrastructure.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities have used a range of mechanisms to meet the affordability commitment, tailored to the individual circumstances of each proposal. In some instances, the local authority itself owns the lands and consequently has a high degree of control in terms of ensuring delivery of a portion of units at affordable prices and on those sites, local authorities will be providing extra social housing over and above the 10%\u00a0required under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.<\/p>  <p>  Where land is owned privately, providers of housing have entered into an undertaking with local authorities where, in recognition of the early delivery of the necessary public infrastructure, those providers have undertaken that housing will be delivered in accordance within an aligned timeframe of construction and with agreed cost reductions to be taken off the market price. \u00a0This can be an agreed cost reduction across all units or a larger cost reduction across a specified number of units. <\/p>  <p>  I have asked the Dublin local authorities to seek to provide as much affordability as possible on related sites. However, under the criteria originally set out in LIHAF, the expectation is that\u00a0cost reductions will be delivered to make housing more affordable than would otherwise be the case, as opposed to requiring that housing be priced under a certain ceiling. The cost of building in Dublin is high relative to other parts of the country, driven primarily by high land costs\u00a0and the viability of private developments would have been affected by any unrealistic ceilings or price capping, whereas the approach being\u00a0taken is designed to promote supply, while achieving a cost reduction that is proportionate to the investment in public infrastructure and provides a benefit in terms of both the overall market effect of increased supply. \u00a0In certain cases, the cost reductions will be aggregated and spread over a smaller number of units to deliver a greater cost reduction and, in those cases, those units will be targeted at key societal groups that may be impacted or priced out of the market.<\/p>  <p>  To date, I have signed grant agreements for 22 of the 34 proposals which received preliminary approval and I will shortly publish further details regarding the approved LIHAF projects on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600072#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Staff","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600072#WRC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[45286\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600072#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason the original service level agreements between local authorities and Irish Water that would have retained the services of local authority waterworks personnel to Irish Water up to 2026 have been amended; if local authority waterworks personnel will be asked to transfer to Irish Water within the next year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1432","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.\u00a0The Water Services Strategic Plan - A Plan for the Future of Water Services (WSSP), which was published in October 2015, set out strategic objectives for the delivery of water services for 25 years up to 2040.

The WAB \u00a0is being established to advise on measures needed to improve the transparency and accountability of Irish Water. The body will report on a quarterly basis to\u00a0an Oireachtas Committee on the performance of Irish Water on the implementation of its business plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Confidence and Supply Arrangement in support of the minority Government has confirmed the retention of Irish Water as a single national utility in public ownership,\u00a0responsible for the delivery of water and waste water services.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Since 2013, working through Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with the local authorities, Irish Water has made significant progress in establishing the utility capability, which has included investing over &euro;2 billion in the system to date.\u00a0Over the past year, significant design phase work has been undertaken on the development of a transformation plan, in line with the Business Plan objectives. Flowing from this, I have been informed by Ervia (which has responsibility for Irish Water), that they consider that the public water system will benefit significantly by greater integration of operations into the single utility. Consequently, the Ervia Board has agreed in principle not to renew the SLAs beyond 2025 when they are due to end, and to move to a full integrated public utility operations model. The Water Services Acts already provide the necessary protections for terms and conditions, and pensions, of local authority staff working under the SLAs in such circumstances. It is the intention of Ervia to work with local authorities to manage this change within the life of the current Business Plan (i.e. by end of 2021). <\/p>  <p>  A process of engagement with\u00a0local authorities on the proposed next steps on the transformation plan has now commenced. The SLAs between Irish Water and local authorities have not been amended and remain in place until such time as an alternative is agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600072#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Accommodation","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600072#WRC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[45287\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600072#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if emergency measures will be put in place to properly accommodate Travellers in Spring Lane, County Cork, and other sites that have been storm damaged.","asker":"1432","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, housing authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and also have responsibility for the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programmes (TAPs) in their areas.\u00a0 My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to any damage incurred by events such as storm Ophelia, it is a matter for each housing authority to assess any damage caused to Traveller-specific accommodation in their area.\u00a0 I understand that Cork City Council are currently liaising with the residents at Spring Lane in this regard.\u00a0 As part of the capital funding supports provided by my Department, funding of 50% is provided to housing authorities for the purchase of &lsquo;Emergency Replacement Mobiles&rsquo;.

This spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care, guidance counselling and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves accessing other supports such as educational psychology services.  Additionally, schools engage in a wide range of sport and cultural activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth. The whole staff shares responsibility for general student well-being.<\/p>  <p>The Well-being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) provides a framework for schools to present in an integrated way the existing elements of good practice to promote social and emotional learning, and mental health and direct them to new practices as appropriate. They provide clear information for schools and for agencies supporting schools on how to address issues of social and emotional learning. The Guidelines outline how schools support young people through early intervention and prevention, modelled on the NEPS Continuum of Support tiered approach.   <\/p>  <p>  The key messages in the Guidelines are that: <\/p>  <p>  - Schools play a vital role in providing a protective environment for young people which can counter risk factors.    <\/p>  <p>  - Having a whole school approach which fosters important links with the wider school community, and agencies which support schools, is key to successful implementation of the Guidelines <\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the systematic implementation of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the DES support services and other external agencies and support services. <\/p>  <p>As stated the   Guidelines form a framework within which a broad range of existing processes and practices can be rationalised within schools. Support for the school community in this regard is provided by a number of sources within my Department including the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and the Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT).<\/p>  <p>  Within my Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education in 2016\/19 mental health and well-being is afforded a high priority and is one of the key goals. The actions relating to well-being and mental health include supporting schools to implement the national Well-being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) through: <\/p>  <p>- Introduction of a well-being programme at Junior Cycle:   Guidelines on Well-being in Junior Cycle have been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to support the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015.   Introduction of the well-being guidelines to post primary schools was initiated in September 2017.   <\/p>  <p>- Increasing the capacity of NEPS  : an enhanced educational psychological service to schools, through the appointment of an additional 10 educational psychologists.  The focus of this additional support, in the context of post-primary schools, is on extending the delivery of training to teachers in DEIS schools in the Friends programmes. This programme, when delivered by trained teachers, reduces anxiety and promotes coping, resilience and school-connectedness in children and young people. <\/p>  <p>   In addition psychologists provide support to schools in implementing Student Support Teams in Post Primary Schools (2014) and Responding to Critical incidents Guidelines and Resource Materials for schools (2016). <\/p>  <p>- Enhancing Guidance Counselling Provision at post-primary level: Recent budgets saw improvements in guidance allocation to schools, with Budgets 2016 and 2017 together seeing the allocation of the equivalent of 400 guidance posts, following budget measures in 2012 which removed the ex-quota provision for guidance posts (which amounted to some 600 posts).  The 400 guidance posts which have now been restored will be allocated separately and transparently and once again<\/p>  <p>A Well-being Steering Committee  , within my Department, continues to examine issues in relation to the co-ordination and aligning of the range of supports provided to both primary and post-primary schools in regard to well-being and mental health promotion.<\/p>  <p>  Finding new ways of tackling policy issues that are not the sole responsibility of any one Government Department or Agency has been prioritised by Government. Youth mental health and suicide prevention is one of three Pathfinder projects under Action 5 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan (2014) and agreed by the Civil Service Management Board.  This Pathfinder Youth Mental Health Project is an initiative to innovate and improve whole-of-Government working on cross-cutting policy issues and improve the delivery of shared whole-of-Government projects to strengthen the prioritisation, management and accountability of cross-cutting projects that involve multiple Departments, Offices and Agencies and ensure that policies that are not the priority or responsibility of a single body are effectively managed, supported and resourced. <\/p>  <p>In addition my Department has been involved with the Taskforce on Youth Mental Health as part of the programme for Government and is represented on this Taskforce.  One of the challenges of providing a coordinated, streamlined approach to promoting well-being and mental health is of course the fact that there are so many statutory and voluntary agencies\/services\/NGOs involved. The Task Force was established to produce a series of action focused recommendations to improve youth mental health and well-being. The main areas of focus comprised: emotional literacy and reduction of stigma; awareness of services and supports; accessibility to services and supports across different settings; alignment of services and supports across different providers; and building capacity in local communities.  The report has been passed by the Secretary General of the DOH and approved by the Minister. It is intended to submit a memorandum for Government shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600074#WRE07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Site Acquisitions","counter":269,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600074#WRE07100"},{"type":"question","counter":270,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[45551\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600074#WRE07200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department has an interest in the site of a school (details supplied); if he envisages future use by his Department for the site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":271,"content":"<p>The property referred to by the Deputy is not in my ownership.

religious instruction or worship.<\/p>  <p>  ETB schools are multi-denominational schools and as such are required to provide for religious instruction according to the profile of the students who attend the school.<\/p>  <p>  It may have been reasonable when the schools were established for a school to assume that its pupil population was predominately catholic and to make arrangements for religious instruction and worship exclusively on that basis. Historically some ETB schools also made provision for religious instruction required for pupils from local Protestant communities. Depending on their future pupil composition as multi-denominational schools, ETB second level schools may have to make provision for religious instruction for those from other minority religions should it be required. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that schools consult with parents and in the case of pupils who have reached the age of 18, the pupil, to find out what their wishes are in respect of participating in religious instruction and worship. This practice should also apply to the parents of pupils already enrolled in the school and not just those seeking admission for the first time.<\/p>  <p>  Schools engaging with parents, or pupils where appropriate, should at the outset of the school year clearly indicate what arrangements are in place for those who chose not to participate in religious instruction.  The outcome of this engagement should be integrated with the school&rsquo;s processes for establishing subject choices generally. Instead of waiting for a parent to request a withdrawal and then having to make alternative arrangements for the pupil for the class periods concerned, pupils who do not chose religious instruction should be timetabled by the school for alternative subjects.<\/p>  <p>  Societal change with a decrease in religious belief and practice requires change in school practice and the circular will address how those who wish to withdraw must be catered for in future.<\/p>  <p>  It is my intention to issue the circular later this year and that it will also apply to Community Schools in all of which ETBs are co-patrons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600075#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600075#WRF01800"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[45627\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600075#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) was refused a reader in school: and if this decision will be reconsidered","asker":"1215","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  <\/p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.\u00a0 Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.\u00a0 The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. <\/p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his statutory functions and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard. Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between valuation of rateable property and the levying and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. <\/p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. This has been the policy of successive governments and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office. The Valuation Acts provide for revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value over time due to changes in economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis. This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made to date. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to property used in the horse training and wider equine industry, I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that there has been some apparent confusion in media reports as to the rateability of certain elements of the sector. The Valuation Act 2001 (Schedule 3, Sections 1(a) and (b)) provides that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose, are rateable. The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) and all developed land are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act. I am advised that the only element of the equine sector which satisfies the exemption provisions in Schedule 4 is the breeding of horses. Buildings used for breeding of horses are classified as being of agricultural use and are \"farm buildings\" as defined in the Act. Therefore, these buildings are exempted from the payment of rates under paragraph 5 of Schedule 4.<\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, buildings used for the training of racehorses, recreational equestrian purposes or livery premises are rateable under the Act because they are considered to be part of a commercial enterprise and are not exempt under the provisions of Schedule 4. Such buildings would typically include stables for horses, covered riding arenas, tack rooms and ancillary buildings used to support the enterprise. It would appear from the details supplied with the Deputy&rsquo;s question that the activities being carried out in this instance would not be exempt activities and so the properties in question would be deemed rateable under the Valuation Acts.<\/p>  <p>  While acknowledging the important contribution which the equine sector makes to the economy, there are no plans to reclassify buildings and lands used for training of horses from being rateable to being exempt from rates. To do so would be at variance with the provisions in the Valuation Acts which maintains the long-standing position that property occupied and used for commercial enterprises is liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other equally important services, which would be difficult in equity to resist. This could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600075#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Controls","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600075#WRF03300"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[45388\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600075#WRF03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he is satisfied that racial profiling is not taking place at immigration controls in the airports and ports; the guidelines that are provided to immigration officers as to the way in which persons are selected for questioning at passport control as against those that are simply waived; if figures or records are kept on the number of persons questioned; if a disproportionate number of those are naturalised immigrants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that racial profiling is not a feature of Irish immigration control. <\/p>  <p>  There is no selection of persons at passport control.

In the case of persons seeking entry to the State who are nationals of an EEA Member State or qualifying dependants, this is set out in Regulations which transpose the EU Freedom of\u00a0Movement Directives.

I\u00a0want to assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the impact of crime on rural communities, including the serious damage done by organised gangs who target rural areas to engage in burglary and other property-related crime. <\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate it is\u00a0the Garda Commissioner\u00a0who is\u00a0responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.\u00a0 However, I can assure the Deputy that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that optimum use is made of these resources. \u00a0<\/p><p>The success of the Garda measures to tackle burglary being implemented through Operation Thor is borne out by latest available CSO crime figures which show a very significant decline in property related crime. It is encouraging to note that since the launch of Operation Thor in late 2015, the CSO burglary figures have shown a significant 30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to 2015.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Operation Thor\u00a0involves a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for Garda overtime in 2017. We have also invested heavily in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015 and a provision of &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles under the Capital Plan 2016-2021. <\/p><p>These additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime\u00a0via Operation Thor.\u00a0<\/p><p>Under Operation Thor we have seen over 83,260 targeted checkpoints and\u00a061,580\u00a0crime prevention patrols nationwide. This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of\u00a05,540 arrests and 6,150 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  <\/p><p>This Government has also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b><\/b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary. This new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.\u00a0 The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations. <\/p><p>There are a range of partnership initiatives which have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and important rural-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural community organisations. These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme.\u00a0<\/p><p>Furthermore, I was pleased to recently announce that an additional &euro;100,000 was being made available to Text Alert Groups, registered with An\u00a0Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na,\u00a0to provide modest financial assistance with the running costs they incur each year.\u00a0\u00a0This\u00a0Text Alert Rebate\u00a0Scheme\u00a0will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and Groups wishing to participate\u00a0in the Scheme can find more details at <i><i>www.muintiir.ie.<\/i><\/i><\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the\u00a0community policing\u00a0ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.\u00a0 It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.\u00a0 Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. <\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.\u00a0 The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this\u00a0 Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.<\/p><p>Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600075#WRF04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Law Reform Commission Reports","counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600075#WRF04500"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[45432\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600075#WRF04600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the Law Reform Commission's 2005 report on multi party litigation; his further views on the recommendations of the report; if he will legislate to implement them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>The position in relation to the matters which the Deputy has raised remains as I have conveyed in my Written Reply to Question No. 182 of 24 October 2017 which I shall therefore reiterate on this occasion.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of multi-party litigation was the subject of a Report and recommendations by the Law Reform Commission in 2005 (LRC 76-2005) as the Deputy has mentioned. The Report was not carried forward by the Government of the day. The implementation of the Report at this remove, and the introduction of any legislation to enable the type of collective legal action envisaged, would require a detailed consideration of the merits and impacts in the public interest, including in terms of the sustainability of a collective action regime and its potential costs to the parties concerned and to the Exchequer. The areas of law involved include consumer protection, competition, the environment and the provision of financial and other services. Consideration would also have to be given to the relevant intervening developments that have taken place at the national, European Union and wider international levels.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on the 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 13,412.

A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.

They found that, based on available evidence, none of the public access defibrillation programmes that were assessed were considered cost-effective using conventional willingness to pay thresholds. <\/p>  <p>  Following on from this, early this year, the Health Service Executive established an Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Steering Group. The purpose of this project is to improve survival rates for those who suffer an out of hospital cardiac arrest through the development and implementation of an out of hospital cardiac arrest strategy. This work will support the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and Community First Responder Ireland (CFR Ireland) in their commitment to improve clinical outcomes for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA). <\/p>  <p>  Both the NAS and CFR Ireland are working with other partners to enable a sustainable response to such events.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE National Community First Responder framework for Ireland declared that CFRs offer a valuable and complementary resource to emergency ambulance provision, positively impacts NAS response time and achieves improved survival for OHCA. It demonstrated how the NAS and CFR Ireland intend to consolidate, enhance and implement further CFR schemes over the next five years through a National Community First Responder Framework. Its ambitions over the next few years include increasing the availability of training in CPR in schools, work places and local groups and making Public Access Defibrillators more easily accessible with people knowing how to use them. It also aims to:<\/p>  <p>  - Work in partnership with all relevant organisations (statutory, voluntary, community and private sectors) to increase the availability of Public Access Defibrillators;<\/p>  <p>  - Put in place effective arrangements to ensure that Public Access Defibrillators are mapped, maintained and accessible to the public; and<\/p>  <p>  - Commence a public awareness campaign to increase the level of provision of CFR Schemes in geographical areas of priority.<\/p>  <p>  And so one of the means to help improve outcomes in this area is CFR groups. These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area. They are then able to provide an early intervention in situations such as heart attack or cardiac arrest by providing, among other things, resuscitation and defibrillation.<\/p>  <p>  Cardiac First Responders (CFR) Ireland, launched in 2015, is the national umbrella organisation for Community First Responders Groups. CFR Ireland works with the National Ambulance Service, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the Centre for Emergency Medical Science UCD. Both the NAS and CFR Ireland currently support over 145 Community First Responder schemes throughout Ireland, who train community members to provide emergency care support.<\/p>  <p>  If an emergency 999\/112 call for cardiac arrest, choking, chest pain or breathing difficulties is made to the National Ambulance Service in an area where a CFR group is established, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location and call details. The First Responder then goes straight to the scene and administers initial care (defibrillation if required) until the National Ambulance Service Emergency resources arrive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600076#WRG06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600076#WRG07000"},{"type":"question","counter":409,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[45413\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600076#WRG07100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which he plans to reduce the long waiting times being experienced by children in counties Cavan and Monaghan who are in need of an assessment for occupational therapy.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":410,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600076#WRG07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600077#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":413,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[45420\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600077#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":414,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The removal of wax by ear syringing is also considered to be comprehended by the GMS contract if the removal of wax forms part of the \"proper and necessary treatment\" required by an eligible patient. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that in recent times some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy and ear syringing services in some circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position of the Government and the Oireachtas that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.

Where this is not possible, the Health Service Executive supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  I am familiar with the particular research referred to by the Deputy, and he will be aware having met with me on the day that I was present at its launch in September. The report documents the views, likes, dislikes and wishes of persons living in our nursing homes. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that it is fundamentally important that residents' rights and dignity are respected and valued and that their views are listened to and acted upon. The significant role that a nursing home fulfils in the provision of a &ldquo;home from home&rdquo; for its residents must be recognised and acknowledged. Residential services for older people should be person-centred and I am convinced that older people should be the driving force in the design and delivery of those services which are provided to them.  Their voices and views should be listened to and they must be allowed play a meaningful role in shaping their own homes and communities.<\/p>  <p>  This is, for example enshrined in the \"National Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland\" (2016) developed by HIQA. The standards inter alia provide a framework for service providers for the continual development of person - centred services. Standard 1.3 outlines that residents have a right to exercise choice and have their needs and preferences taken into account in relation to services. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to ageism in a broader context, the National Positive Ageing Strategy, published in 2013 provides a framework for cooperation to address age-related policy and service delivery across Government and society in the years ahead.  The Strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and well-being of our ageing citizens. Combatting ageism is one of the cross cutting objectives of the strategy. Revised arrangements for the implementation and monitoring of the strategy were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform in October, 2016. The first National Positive Ageing Indicators Report was published in 2016 and is available on the Department's website. Earlier this year the Department facilitated the inaugural stakeholder Forum under the NPAS. The forum provided an opportunity for stakeholders to work collaboratively and to identify key priorities. Those stakeholders have been facilitated with an opportunity to directly engage with relevant Departments in relation to those identified priorities. The Department of Health intends to follow up with the stakeholders in relation to their experience, towards the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600077#WRH02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Regulation","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600077#WRH03100"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[45461\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600077#WRH03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will request that the manufacturers of statins sold here to make available the essential underlying research data used by each of the manufacturers regarding the adverse effects associated with statins.","asker":"1315","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":442,"content":"<p>The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the competent authority responsible for the regulation of human medicines in Ireland.

It is a clinically led change programme which is technology enabled.  It is intended that it will improve the delivery of diagnostic laboratory medicine, healthcare quality, efficiency and outcomes for patients in the Irish healthcare system. The existing laboratory systems, as with all digital systems, constantly require upgrading and maintenance. A number of currently deployed laboratory systems required hardware, operating system and database upgrades in 2014 and 2015 to ensure that they would operate safely  and be supported by the vendors of the system. These laboratory systems were deployed in the 1990&rsquo;s and have been upgraded several times in that time frame.

The contract is a fixed price contract for the delivery of the Cerner solution replacing all the existing systems in the 43 HSE and Voluntary Laboratories with the Cerner Millennium system.

It will also provide for the delivery of functional interfaces to multiple external systems, e.g., Order Communications Results Reporting, Patient Administration Systems, Healthlink and other national clinical systems, e.g., National Renal System.<\/p><p>Such a complex change programme has taken longer to design, test and implement than originally planned by both the HSE and Cerner. However, as the contract is a fixed price delivery contract the HSE does not incur any additional supplier costs due to schedule adjustments. The MedLIS project is primarily about patient safety and quality improvement of services being provided by the Laboratory Service.  As such it is critically important that the solution is delivered in accordance with the workflows designed to the Irish Laboratory requirements.  Schedule adjustments made now are done to ensure that the project will be fit for purpose, underpinning patient safety at all times and delivering a solution that is functionally beneficial for the Laboratory Service. The project is currently being closely monitored by the HSE project steering group and is on schedule to 'go-live' in St. James Hospital in Q2 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600079#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electronic Health Records","counter":558,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600079#WRK01300"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[45621\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600079#WRK01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the delay in the roll-out of the new national information technology systems for maternity hospitals; the expected date for this system to commence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>The Maternal &amp;amp; Newborn Clinical Management System (MN-CMS) is a pathfinder project towards developing a National Healthcare Electronic Record. The project started with the realisation that healthcare interaction in the future will ultimately be digital and it follows the strategic direction set out in the eHealth strategy for Ireland published in 2013. <\/p>  <p>Although the MN-CMS is primarily about the documentation and communication of mother and baby clinical information, there are a number of other components.  These include order communications (blood investigations, microbiological investigations, ultrasound, procedures) and drug prescribing. The MN-CMS project encompasses a wide range of stakeholders including  midwives, obstetricians, neonatologists, anaesthetists and others in both   the community and allied health specialties. Most importantly, the Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management System aims to help put the patients at the centre of the care plan.<\/p>  <p>The programme is a large, complex business change and technological project. The system went live in Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH)  in December 2016 and the Maternity Unit in University Hospital Kerry in March 2017.  Integration between the GP&rsquo;s ICT system and the MN-CMS in the Cork region is due to commence on the 31st   October. Following successful sign-off of the integration, it will be deployed to all GPs interacting with the Maternal &amp;amp; Newborn Clinical Management System.<\/p>  <p>  As with any large-scale change programme there are lessons to be taken from the initial deployment and continuous process improvements to both the IT system and the workflows. Healthcare deployment of technology must always ensure that patient safety considerations are to the fore.  The improvements are currently being deployed into both existing hospitals and the next hospitals due to implement the MN-CMS are the Rotunda Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital. I can confirm that the HSE have informed me that the Rotunda Hospital is due to go-live with the MN-CMS in November 2017 followed by the National Maternity Hospital in early 2018 and subsequently to all the remaining Maternity Hospital Units.<\/p>  <p>  The changes brought about through the implementation of the MN-CMS have had a positive impact on the hospitals who have deployed it.  The MN-CMS has brought about improvement in the management of patient information, patient safety and the communication between clinical teams. It has led to standardisation of information collection and in the future will lead to standardisation of care. Its future success will depend on a positive multi-disciplinary approach and a determination to be part of setting new national and international standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600079#WRK01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600079#WRK01700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Afforestation Programme","counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600079#WRK01600"},{"type":"question","counter":562,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[45438\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600079#WRK01700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to increase the GPC 1 grant and premium to reflect the cost of establishment and the agricultural income foregone on land (details supplied) in the mid-term review of the forest programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":563,"content":"<p>The Mid-Term Review of the Afforestation Programme is currently under preparation and my Department is involved in detailed discussions with stakeholders on it, including on the issues raised by the Deputy.

As outlined in the Energy White Paper, Government policy is to ensure that policy choices impacting energy costs are evidence-based with a focus on competitiveness, cost-benefit, security and sustainability.The electricity and gas markets are commercial and deregulated operating within national and European regulatory regimes.\u00a0I have no statutory function in the monitoring or setting of gas or electricity prices. <\/p><p>Responsibility for the regulation of the gas or electricity markets is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which is an independent statutory body.<\/p><p>At a national level, the deregulated energy market results in choices for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices.\u00a0 I would encourage consumers to either switch supplier or to contact their current supplier to ensure that the best available deal is being provided.

It also conducts regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices. <\/p><p>Energy efficiency supports also represent a significant opportunity for consumers and businesses to reduce their energy costs. The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) provides the policy framework for energy efficiency in Ireland. Energy efficiency supports are available via the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), to assist both business and domestic energy consumers, with significant funding allocated to them.<\/p><p>In the recent\u00a0Budget, I\u00a0secured approximately &euro;107 million in capital funding for energy efficiency schemes in 2018, a 34% increase on the 2017 allocation. The capital increase will allow the SEAI to support the expansion of\u00a0energy efficiency schemes. This will mean that 28,500 homes will be upgraded, including 9,000 low income households, and that bills for homes and business will be reduced by approximately &euro;26 million, with 483 gigawatt hours of energy saved and 120,000 tonnes of carbon emissions saved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600080#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600080#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":624,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[45402\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600080#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of homes that are in the light blue areas of the national broadband plan map that have been connected since the initiation of this phase of the plan, by county.","asker":"1274","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[45403\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600080#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of homes in the amber area of the national broadband plan that are awaiting internet connections.","asker":"1274","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":626,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[45404\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600080#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the implementation status of the national broadband plan.","asker":"1274","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":627,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 232, 233 and 234 together.<\/p><p>The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) will ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.\u00a0 The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecommunications sector so that to date approximately 1.5m or 65% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband and this footprint is expanding.

The most recent CSO figures for Consistent Poverty indicated that 2.6% of women over 65, and 2.9% of men over 65, are in consistent poverty, which is less than a third that of the general population.  Eurostat figures also show that men and women over 65 are less likely to be at risk of poverty and social exclusion in Ireland than in the EU as a whole, with the gap in outcomes between men and women being significantly narrower in Ireland than most countries. <\/p>  <p>  I intend to publish a Pensions Reform Plan by the end of this year.  The aim of the planned reforms will be to establish a sound and fit for purpose overall pension system for the coming decades, one that is sustainable and which will shape the retirement landscape to the benefit of our retirees for generations to come.  One of the main components of that Plan will be the introduction of a Total Contributions Approach for the contributory pension to replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from about 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  This is a very big change and there are a lot of legal, administrative, and technical elements to put in place before it can be done.  Its aim is to provide as fair a basis as possible for the calculation of contributory pensions while removing the anomalies of the existing system.  Key to the design of this new approach will be the position of women who have gaps in their contribution records as a result of caring duties. <\/p>  <p>Officials in my Department are currently examining data from the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which was finalised recently.  Following completion of this analysis, it is intended to have a public consultation on this reform, and this will provide an opportunity for people to submit their views on the priorities in this reform. Following this consultation process, proposals on the final details of the scheme will be made to the Government.  This, in turn, will result in legislation being prepared for consideration by the Oireachtas.   <\/p>  <p>As regards the specific matter of the post-2012 rate bands, I have asked my Department to prepare a report for me on the issue as soon as possible to see what options are open to improving the outcomes for those whose contributory entitlements are lower as a result of that change.  I will be bringing the report to Government as soon as it is ready.  However, the Deputy should bear in mind that the cost of simply reverting to the rate bands from 2000-2012 would be very expensive, would generally increase payments to better-off pensioners with additional means, and would reduce resources available to the broader group of pensioners.  The recent Budget contained increases to the rate of the payment for pensions would not have been feasible if such a reversal of the 2012 changes had also been included, and that would have impacted negatively upon the most vulnerable pensioners, including those with no additional means, and widows and widowers living alone with only one pension payment.   <\/p>  <p>  It should be remembered that, where somebody does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they will generally qualify for an alternative payment, unless they have significant additional means.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult amounting up to up to 90% of a full rate pension, which is based on their own means and is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested non-contributory State pension which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate, based on a household means test. <\/p>  <p>Most pensioners would satisfy the means tests for these two payments, and the very large majority of people paid them receive the maximum rate.  Therefore, it would seem that those in receipt of SPC payments at a lower rate are among the better off pensioners who have significant additional means, over and above state supports.   <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600080#WRL07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Benefit Data","counter":691,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600081#WRM00300"},{"type":"question","counter":692,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[45396\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600081#WRM00400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of the additional maternity leave and benefit for mothers of premature babies who are currently on maternity leave but the children of which were born before 1 October 2017; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1433","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":693,"content":"<p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection does not collect data on the number of mothers with premature babies born before 1 October 2017 who are currently on maternity leave as this information was not necessary to make a decision on an application for maternity benefit prior to 1 October 2017.

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension will be extended to the self-employed from December 2017.   <\/p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the Class A rate of 4%. In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.5% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.75% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.5% or 14.75%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits. <\/p>  <p>The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published on the 18th October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.   <\/p>  <p>The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers will be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review.   <\/p>  <p>As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.   <\/p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020. By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  These costs assume that the cost of extending invalidity pension to the self-employed builds up steeply for the first 10 years after introduction after which time the scheme is almost at maturity or a steady state. <\/p>  <p>  For the shorter term schemes, illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefits, it is estimated that they will reach maturity after 2 years.  Projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assume the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population. <\/p>  <p>The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner. It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.   <\/p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors. It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular state pension contributory. <\/p>  <p>The consultants estimated that the typical cost of state pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI. Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.   <\/p>  <p>  The projections provided in the 2015 actuarial review are based on the system of social insurance, currently in legislation.  It therefore reflects the fact that social insurance applies on a compulsory basis and not on the basis of allowing contributors to opt in at their own discretion. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of whether social insurance cover for the self-employed should be made on a compulsory or voluntary basis was addressed in the third report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare published in 2013.  The then Advisory Group was charged with examining extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The group considered that allowing people a facility to opt in or out at their own discretion could lead to the selection of bad risks. <\/p>  <p>  The fundamental principle of social insurance is social solidarity. Everybody contributes and, if needed, cover for contingencies is available.  Allowing people to opt in or opt out could result in a negation of the social solidary contributory principles which underline the system. In addition, it would be likely to mean that a higher contribution would be required from those who opt in on a voluntary basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600081#WRM02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":713,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600081#WRM02500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Planning Framework","counter":712,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600081#WRM02400"},{"type":"question","counter":713,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[45540\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600081#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will address concerns regarding aspects of the national framework plan that are creating uncertainty for local authority funding streams particularly in rural areas.","asker":"1347","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":714,"content":"<p>I am not aware of any aspects of the recently published final consultation draft of the National Planning Framework Ireland 2040 &ndash; Our Plan, that would have any adverse implications for the funding streams of local authorities, particularly in rural areas.  <\/p>  <p>  On the contrary, through alignment with the forthcoming 10-year Capital Investment Plan, I believe that the NPF will be of considerable benefit to local authorities, both urban and rural, in setting out a co-ordinated strategic development framework for the development of the country as a whole, and within which Government Departments and Agencies, the Regional Assemblies and local authorities, as well as wider private sector and community interests, will work together to ensure proper planning and sustainable development. <\/p>  <p>  Moreover, the draft Framework includes practical planning, development and investment policies which will benefit rural Ireland by driving planned and community-led regeneration initiatives, aimed at re-purposing rural economies to benefit from new technology, driving economic activities and improved quality of life.<\/p>  <p>Submissions on the final consultation draft of the NPF are invited until Friday 3rd   November, after which the Government intends to address such submissions and finalise the Framework along with the 10-year capital investment plan by year-end.

Approved housing bodies (AHBs) are also very active\u00a0in delivery in Kildare, as can be seen with the\u00a045 new homes approved\u00a0through the Capital Advance Leasing Facility\u00a0and, over 2016\/17, a further 100 new homes were\u00a0acquired by AHBs\u00a0for\u00a0households on the Kildare social housing waiting list through the Capital Assistance Scheme. <\/p><p>In addition, between 2014 and the end of this year, around 100 vacant social houses in Kildare\u00a0will\u00a0have been returned to\u00a0productive use through the programme of funding support from my Department.<\/p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme is also\u00a0supporting local authorities and AHBs\u00a0for the long term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners and developers for social housing use. Currently, there are around\u00a0375 operational units under this programme\u00a0in Kildare.<\/p><p>Over 1,300 households are also being supported currently through\u00a0the HAP scheme in\u00a0Kildare. This will continue to provide a flexible housing support for addressing the housing needs of households presenting as homeless to Kildare County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600082#WRN02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Accommodation Provision","counter":781,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600082#WRN02100"},{"type":"question","counter":782,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[45486\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600082#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the extent to which emergency housing accommodation is available to Kildare County Council to accommodate the increasing emergency housing need; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":783,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[45489\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102600082#WRN02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the degree to which he expects to meet the imminent housing demand following the displacement of persons from private accommodation for a variety of reasons, including repossession and the immediate needs of such persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":784,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 292 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.\u00a0 Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual housing authorities.\u00a0 My Department has no function in relation to operational issues, such as placements into emergency accommodation, which are a matter for the relevant housing authorities. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Housing Act 1988, it is a matter for the housing authority concerned to determine whether a person is regarded as homeless.\u00a0 Any person regarded as homeless by a housing authority may be placed into temporary emergency accommodation, which the housing authority may arrange itself or which may be operated by a State-funded service provider. \u00a0I am satisfied that housing authorities, including Kildare County Council, are making every effort to provide the most suitable accommodation available to homeless households seeking emergency accommodation<\/p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness comprises a range of actions\u00a0to tackle homelessness and to assist families residing in emergency accommodation.
