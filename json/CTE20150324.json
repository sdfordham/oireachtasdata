As the State's seafood development agency, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, is tasked with the conservation and development of the seafood sector.  We employ 123 persons, some of whom are parttime.  Our current staff number is one hundred and fourteen and a half fulltime equivalent positions, a reduction of 30% on the number employed in 2009.  Despite this reduction in numbers, I am glad to report that 2013 signalled the start of an ambitious corporate plan by BIM entitled,Capturing Ireland&rsquo;s Share of the Global Seafood Opportunity 20132017.  This strategy is consistent with the Government&rsquo;s wider strategy for the agrifood sector.  This tailored plan includes ambitious targets and encapsulates a clear vision for the seafood sector.  Put simply, we are intent on growing a thriving seafood industry.  We will do this by expanding the raw material base, adding value and developing efficient supply chains that together will deliver on the Government&rsquo;s targets for the seafood sector and create sustainable jobs.  We believe that by delivering on these objectives seafood sales can be increased to in excess of &euro;1 billion.  We can add up to 45,000 tonnes of new raw material to the seafood base and thus create up to 1,200 jobs.<br\/><br\/>Our strategy informs the business plan for BIM up to 2017 and beyond.  More specifically, it involves working closely with the industry to take advantage of current and future market opportunities through enhanced sustainability which we believe is central to everything we should do, increased competitiveness, greater industry scale and expansion of the raw material base, all underpinned by appropriate levels of training and professionalism throughout the sector.<br\/><br\/>I would like to set out in more detail the five key strategic objectives of the plan.<b><\/b>Our first concern is to add value<b><\/b>to the fish we land, be it farmed or caught in the wild.  The demand for seafood is growing and in the next decade projected to grow by 42 million tonnes per annum according to the Food and Agricultural Organization, FAO.  The major factors contributing to this growth are the increasing world population, the growth in spending power in Asia and the preference in that region for seafood.  The growing demand for seafood in Asia may be expected to have a knock-on effect in traditional markets in Europe which are now almost 65% dependent on imports.  BIM is confident that the combination of these factors is creating new business opportunities for the Irish seafood industry.  If the industry is to gain advantage from this prospective growth in demand, it is imperative that it expand output if it is to compete in the global marketplace.  Therefore, it is essential that additional sources of raw material are sought to generate the expanded levels of new and innovative value added seafood products that will be needed to capitalise on the emerging market opportunities.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The second objective is the scaling of the sector.<b><\/b>BIM firmly believes there is a big opportunity to grow the sector from its current turnover level of approximately &euro;850 million to in excess of &euro;1 billion.<\/p><p>To do this, we need largescale operators.  The seafood industry employs up to 11,000 in fishing, fish farming and fish processing and these jobs are located in peripheral coastal regions.  Family owned firms are dominant.  There are 180 registered seafood companies with processing facilities in Ireland.  A large proportion of this number are small scale firms, with a turnover ranging from &euro;3 million to &euro;10 million.  In addition, there is a significant number of artisan scale operations supplying dispersed local markets such as shops and restaurants.  This is in contrast to a typical European competitor which has a turnover in the order of &euro;50 million.<br\/><br\/>Compounding the lack of scale is our geographical position on the periphery of mainland Europe.  In reality, this means that it can be very difficult for Irish seafood companies supplying perishable product to compete with much larger European counterparts in the marketplace.  This is particularly relevant when dealing with buyers from large continental companies that require daily delivery arrangements.  In the next five years BIM will lead the sector in its efforts to build scale and create the necessary level of competitiveness to compete in the long term and realise its capacity to grow revenue and generate jobs.  Appropriate scale, particularly in defined product categories, will enable a company or a group of companies working collaboratively to invest in marketing, research, advanced business and monitoring systems, all of which will open access to new markets and improve company profitability.  BIM commenced this work in 2012 with the route to market programme and in subsequent years, through the implementation of this strategy, will continue to work with the industry on an ambitious business development strategy.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The third objective concerns the critical supply of raw materials.<b><\/b>There is a big future in processing in Ireland and adding value to catches must be at the heart of it.  To do this, we need to increase the volume of raw material supplied by various means.  When one looks at the global market, it is clear that Ireland is a small player in the world seafood scene.  As a consequence, Irish seafood companies cannot and should not try to compete on a cost basis against cheaper third country produce such as pangasius or tilapia which are heavily imported into the European Union.  If we are to maximise the return from our precious seafood resource, we need to differentiate Irish seafood products from those of lower cost producers.  The need to move from commodity trading, with the exception of some pelagic species, is of paramount importance to the Irish seafood industry.  In addition, the need for added value products is driven by younger generations of consumers who are demanding more convenience in product presentation and meal preparation.  This is a feature of newly emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere, as well as in traditional European markets.  A strong focus on maximising additional value will ensure the industry will be able to keep abreast of this trend and, ultimately, protect market share and ensure long-term financial sustainability.  The facilities at the Seafood Development Centre in Clonakilty will critically support this priority objective.<br\/><br\/>Our fourth objective is sustainability.<b><\/b>Anything we do in the sector must take into account the sustainability of stock.  Thus BIM&rsquo;s priority to enhance the sustainability of seafood has due regard to the Europe 2020 strategy which sets the agenda in creating a resource efficient Europe.  It also reflects Government policy on how Ireland can achieve a resource efficient, low carbon and climate resilient future.<br\/><br\/>Our programmes are likewise informed by the new Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, with its focus on the broader maritime picture, as advocated by the Integrated Maritime Policy, IMP, and its environmental pillar, the marine strategy framework directive.  The new policy is based on exploiting fisheries resources sustainably.  Ecological sustainability is, therefore, a basic premise for the economic and social future of European fisheries and the development of the wider seafood<br\/><br\/>sector.  The CFP will provide critical support for the longterm sustainable future of Ireland&rsquo;s seafood sector and ensuring it can retain access to and grow the resource base on which the industry is dependent.  Through our development initiatives, we are intent on growing the seafood sector by applying green economy principles that align the preferences of environmentally conscious consumers, while maximising renewable resources to reduce waste and input costs and embrace assured food production systems.<\/p><p>Consumers worldwide want to know from where their seafood is coming and are concerned to ensure the seafood they consume is sourced responsibly.  In this context, specific projects undertaken by BIM include consideration of the potential for branding using appropriate quality assurance standards, together with certification from organisations such as the Marine Stewardship Council, as well as organic or ecolabelling.  BIM is geared towards assuring all products covered by its schemes are sustainable, safe and traceable.  It also ensures its assurance schemes are aligned with the Bord Bia origin green programme.  The sustainability positioning provided for by the origin green brand initiative permits participant companies to engage directly with the challenges of sustainability, reduced energy inputs, a minimised carbon footprint and a reduced environmental impact.  In turn, this secures better prices for the food and seafood sectors.<br\/><br\/>On our fifth objective, if we are to grow the sector, it is imperative that those involved have the requisite skills to enable them to maximise opportunities.  In common with other business sectors, the seafood industry needs a regular supply of suitably trained and skilled personnel to work on board fishing vessels, on fish farms and in processing plants.  BIM has a long established record of providing the industry with vocational training to attain appropriate qualifications to work as crew members, skippers and engineers on fishing vessels and this vital service continues.  Building on this tradition, our strategy marks the introduction of a new era of professionalism in the sector.  The provision of accredited training services, allied with a new approach with third level institutions, will secure the seafood sector&rsquo;s place in the modern economy.  The new approach will ensure the skills development work BIM undertakes for the seafood sector is accredited to National and European Framework Qualifications in order that our actions will be fully compatible with the requirements for portable qualifications and lifelong learning progression.<br\/><br\/>BIM&rsquo;s national fisheries college, with locations in Greencastle, Castletownbere and D&uacute;n Laoghaire, is equipped to deliver a broad range of Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and FETAC accredited courses.  They include certificates of competency training courses for fishing vessel deck officers and on engineering, as well as short duration courses on safety, radio, first aid and other nautical skills.  In addition, BIM&rsquo;s mobile coastal training units provide short courses on safety, radio, engineering and navigation skills at ports around the coast, offering industry practitioners convenient access to necessary training.  Courses related to product handling for seafood processors and traders are provided at the Seafood Development Centre in Clonakilty. <br\/><br\/>An integral component of the new strategy is the promotion and development of business management skills in the sector through leadership programmes and the introduction of new seafood business management courses with selected third level institutions aimed at attracting potential seafood graduates into the sector.  The provision of appropriate skills and training for the sector will underpin the drive towards competitiveness which is the central focus of the strategy.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I will now deal with some specific issues highlighted in the report.  Market performance in 2013 demonstrated that lack of supply, one of the key issues, was a problem.  It resulted in a decline in sales from &euro;822 million in 2012 to &euro;810 million in 2013.  In 2013 BIM applied for a licence for an organic salmon farm off Galway Bay.  If successful, the intention is to lease the site to a reputable operator with the necessary capital and expertise to ensure the farm will be run to the strictest of regulatory practices.  With the farm in place, up to 15,000 tonnes of high quality Irish farmed salmon could be produced every year, worth a minimum of &euro;100 million annually and with an average flow of about &euro;14.5 million directly to the economy.  <br\/><br\/>Sustainability is a key growth issue.  As we have seen in our success in the Chinese market, there has been an increase in the size of the middle class and a trend towards quality, sustainably caught and farmed seafood.  With Ireland's reputation for clean waters and quality seafood, Irish seafood can demand an excellent price in new and existing markets, but, labelling and traceability are crucial.  We have developed a range of internationally accredited standards, including the BIM responsibly sourced standard, to further increase sustainable fishing and operational practices for the wild catch and processing sector that underpin Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green charter.<\/p><p>In addition, the seafood sector has realised the benefits of running processing operations in a more sustainable manner and, with assistance under BIM&rsquo;s green seafood business programme, is benefiting from substantial cost savings through greater management of energy and transport usage.  <\/p><p> In 2013 coastal communities played a pivotal role in BIM&rsquo;s fisheries local action group or FLAG programme, funded under Axis 4 of the European Fisheries Fund.  The programme empowers local communities to look at new ways of adding value to the fishing and marine activities in their areas, with a view to generating additional revenue and employment.  This successful programme provided grant aid for 41 projects in 2013, the first year of operation, totalling &euro;95,069, but generated an investment of &euro;178,974.  A number of the fisheries local action groups are implementing their respective strategies through a diverse range of projects that will add value to their local communities&rsquo; infrastructure and business.  <\/p><p> Safety at sea and the necessity for safety training remained a key priority for BIM in 2013.  Following the launch of its enhanced safety training programme, we have a comprehensive safety training programme that also provides grant aid of up to 60% towards the cost of purchasing personal flotation devices, fitted with an integrated personal locator beacon.  The programme complements BIM&rsquo;s basic safety training programme and the fleet safety grant aid scheme ensuring crews receive the best safety training and safety equipment to help save lives at sea.<\/p><p> In 2013 the Seafood Development Centre in Clonakilty, County Cork assisted 29 seafood companies with new product development, branding and labelling advice, sensory panels, pilot testing and equipment and product upscaling.  We also made a significant investment in new technology for the centre, including a new breading-cooking line to generate a range of new products.  To encourage greater participation in the pelagic sector in value added innovation, BIM and Letterkenny Institute of Technology signed a memorandum of understanding to create stronger industry links with the third level sector, including access to culinary development facilities, science and culinary graduates.<\/p><p> It is clear from similar challenges other food sectors have faced and the limits within which we can do business in the current economic climate that we need to think outside the usual parameters of the seafood sector to build industry scale.  BIM is facilitating and proactively pursuing investment opportunities and strategic alliances at home and internationally to generate the necessary capital and resources to ensure the sector can compete effectively.  The growth and longevity of the sector is our primary goal.  We are looking forward to delivering on the potential of the sector in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427205600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keatinge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#L00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1427205600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The presentation is challenging.  In the course of his contribution Mr. Keatinge stated, \"We can add up to 45,000 tonnes of new raw material to the seafood base.\"  Allowing for the fact that there are strict quotas, will he indicate from where the additional 45,000 tonnes will come?  One can create more sales by increasing the added value of the product, but Mr. Keatinge also talked about increasing volume.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Keatinge referred to the creation of an additional 1,200 jobs, in addition to the 11,000 employed in fishing, fish farming and fish processing.  Would it be possible to give the joint committee a breakdown of this number and the locations of those employed in fishing, fish farming, and fish processing?  For example, a man could be fishing out of Killybegs Harbour, but the processing plant could be in a different location.  We need to know the specific detail.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Keatinge referred to product upscaling.  I know a little about upscaling because I have seen it happen incredibly successfully in agriculture and forestry.<\/p><p>However, it is fair to say that, in many cases, indigenous companies which upscale, rather than bringing in companies from outside, actually have a longer shelf life because they are less likely to move.  When the representatives of Bord Iascaigh Mhara refer to upscaling of processing companies, are they referring to existing companies or displacing them with multinational companies which may come and go?  Could Bord Iascaigh Mhara achieve the same result in other ways, allowing for the constraints in sourcing raw material?  No matter what way we look at it, if there is not enough raw material available, companies cannot upscale.<\/p><p> What about market collaboration?  In other words, could groups of processes sell collaboratively?  In that way, from a market supply point of view, there would be a continuous supply.  On the other hand, we could retain companies in the size appropriate to the areas in which they are located.  That is of great importance.  We saw a fantastic example in the mussel industry in Scotland where all mussel producers began to operate in a co-operative.  I gather they had Tesco tied up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#L00300","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427205600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>They have all of them tied up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#M00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1427205600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Yes and when the retailers tried to bring in Dutch mussels, it simply did not work.  Still, they are all operating as independents in this operation, which is important.  The BIM officials will be addressing the question of extra supplies.<\/p> <p>  The BIM officials referred to the application in Galway Bay.  They will be aware of the major reservations about that application.  When we visited Scotland, the people involved in the fish farming industry there seemed rather surprised that BIM was thinking of something of that scale in waters as warm as those in Galway Bay.  Will the officials confirm that they are still hell-bent on following the plan, despite the great reservations in the region, particularly in respect of wild salmon, and in view of the attitude of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources?  In other words, even official agencies are sceptical about this.  It is all likely to wind up in the European courts if BIM secures permission.  Will the BIM officials confirm whether they are still hell-bent on pursuing this project or whether there has been a rethink?<\/p> <p>  Since we are discussing licensing, has BIM had discussions with the Minister in respect of the fact that most of the fish farms around the country are operating on licences that are actually out of date?  I know that they are legally entitled to continue until new licences are issued.  Does BIM consider it satisfactory that existing fish farms are actually operating on licences that are only in place by grace and favour of the law?  In other words, they are operating without a licence, but they have permission to do so until the new applications are granted.  What discussions has BIM had with the Department on bringing a little order to this sector and ensuring those who are operating fish farms have current licences?<\/p> <p>  I am underwhelmed by the fisheries local action group schemes.  It always seems to me that people think they can promote rural Ireland with a few million euro here and there.  However, when it comes to urban Ireland, &euro;300 million, &euro;400 million or &euro;1 billion does not seem to go very far.  How much money is involved in FLAG schemes all around the coast?  To be honest, it is not a major player on the ground and it has never seemed to me to be a major player.  If BIM gives &euro;500,000 to people, they are not going to turn it away, but I do not see it as a major player.<\/p> <p>  Two things are not mentioned in the BIM report.  First, BIM administered a scheme to repair storm damage to pots for lobsters and shrimp last year.  Will the BIM officials indicate how many people applied, how many were paid and how the scheme shook out?  How many were caught by the fact that BIM required fishermen to have original proof of purchase of the lobster pots?  This was proving very difficult in many cases.  Will BIM give detailed numbers of the beneficiaries of the scheme?  How much was paid out?  What were the barriers in accessing the scheme?<\/p> <p>  BIM has grandiose plans, although it seems to be moving backwards rather than forwards in actual sales which have fallen from &euro;822 million to &euro;810 million.<\/p><p>It is important for all of us to realise there are two great factors in our lives.  One is growing the economy in order that we can pay for the services people want.  The other major factor is brought home to every Deputy who goes home every weekend, that is, the fact that we run the country for the people who live in it.  Approximately 80% of boat owners have boats less than 10 m.  The greatest number involved in fishing are actually small operators who live in coastal communities.  The reality is they are trying to get from &euro;5,000 to &euro;7,000 and not to have the dole man come after them.  They are not thinking about grandiose plans involving billions of euro.  They are simply wondering how they can meet their bills next year and how they can hold their communities together.  I see no mention in the document of what we are going to do for them.<\/p><p> I am particularly surprised that there is no reference in BIM's annual report to the work done by this committee on coastal communities in which we highlighted the specific issues faced by this major sector in terms of human beings trying to eke out a living from fishing and the sea.  Seaweed is not mentioned either in it.  I see no mention of whether it is Bord Iascaigh Mhara's intention to act on the strong cross-party recommendations which had the backing of every political party and none, in the form of Deputy Thomas Pringle, represented in the Oireachtas.  Where are we in dealing with that issue?  In this country we seem so hell-bent on the macroeconomy that we forget this is all about ordinary human beings who are trying to survive and make a little more.  They are beset by more and more regulations.  Even if BIM implements its plan, if we do not do anything about the small operators on the ground, nothing will change.  Communities are being destroyed.  I am disappointed, therefore, that there seems to be little in BIM's report that will do anything in line with the report put together by the Oireachtas.  I am surprised that there was no reference in the statement made to the important work done by the joint Oireachtas committee over a long period, work which had all-party support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#M00300","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427205600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the BIM officials for the report.  I have almost identical concerns to Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about the plight of over 80% of those involved in the industry.  This affects every little coastal pier in the west, the south west and on the east coast.  Much of the local economy depends on what is produced by the small operator.  There is nothing coming either from the Government or BIM's report which will help in any way in that regard.  The word being used in reference to the industry and fish stocks is \"sustainability\".  While it is laudable to have sustainability of fish stocks, there is certainly an absence of what will sustain rural coastal communities.<\/p> <p>  Another question was asked by Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about FLAG schemes.  I hope I am reading this incorrectly.  Reference was made to grant aid for 41 projects totalling &euro;95,000 in 2013.  In the scale of things, that is a minuscule amount.<\/p><p>I have argued consistently in my own community and the wider constituency that if used properly, benefits will come from it.  What is missing - I do not say this lightly, certainly at the two meetings BIM officials attended -  is BIM's credibility among coastal communities.  People have lost confidence in it and the wider policy of successive Governments on the survival of coastal and fishing communities.<\/p><p> Mr Keatinge said the demand for seafood was projected to grow by 42 million tonnes per annum, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization.  I assume that is to meet the demand of the increasing world population.  If there is a fish stock sustainability problem, I presume the delegates are talking primarily about fish farming.  I presume the Galway Bay project proposed by BIM which is projected to produce 15,000 tonnes per annum has been factored in to the supply.  Last year the Chairman of the joint committee, Deputies Michael McNamara and &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and I travelled to Scotland to meet people associated with the fishing industry and they were alarmed by the proposed Galway Bay project.  During the storms early last year fish farms and fish escapes in the south suffered damage.  However, if the project had been up and running in Galway Bay, it would have been catastrophic for coastal communities in the south.  BIM proposes to entice a reputable operator to operate the project.  I do not know how that will benefit the majority of coastal communities.  I do not believe everything will go to plan, as there are too many difficulties and the various agencies are not in agreement.  They are in opposition to each other, which can lead to a project not succeeding.  <\/p><p> In practically every coastal village there is an opportunity, if resources are invested in the right direction, to develop the fishing fleet by helping people through difficult times.  There is also potential for the growth of the organic sector.  Have the delegates from BIM ever looked at the possibility of onshore fish farming?  Everybody to whom I have spoken from BIM and other sectors is in opposition to it because of the cost factor which would include the cost of pumping water and electricity.  Has anybody considered taking a joined up approach to marine issues, wind farms and so on?  Is any effort being made by BIM to conduct a pilot scheme in respect of onshore fish farming?  If something like it were to work and be sustainable economically, it could create opportunities in many areas.<\/p><p> Small farmers who are struggling to survive have the opportunity to avail of the farm assist scheme.  Those who are not making a viable income from their holding can resort to that scheme until they get out of their difficulties.<\/p><p>It helps to sustain them on their land and avoid the social consequences of their leaving their area.  Has any thought been given to introducing a similar assistance scheme for fishermen?  Mr. Keatinge has referred to boat owners and crew members.  Could the social insurance scheme be tailored in such a way that fishermen would be encouraged to sign on when they have no work, rather than being treated as self-employed persons with no such rights?  Just after Christmas there was a period of 12 or 13 weeks during which the 80% of fishermen engaged in onshore fishing could not work.  Has any thought be given to initiatives to sustain that sector in order that we keep as many people as possible in coastal communities who will contribute to the local economy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#N00200","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427205600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keatinge for his presentation on the 2013 annual report.  I have a number of questions and would also like to have an opportunity to follow up on the responses given.<\/p> <p>  The outturn for 2013 showed a deficit of &euro;500,000.  To what does this relate?  Why was there a significantly reduced turnover in the operation of the ice plant and a significant rise in costs?<\/p> <p>  Ireland has an appalling record in using EU funding to support communities that have lost out because of declining quotas.  Under the last European Fisheries Policy, I do not think we drew down any funding, whereas other countries such as Spain drew down billions of euro.  We have drawn down money for decommissioning but nothing to support communities or fishermen who can no longer fish.  That has been one of the disgraceful aspects of our fisheries policy.  <\/p> <p>  In relation to the FLAG, fisheries local action group, programme, I know that the committee met officials from the Commission in Brussels.  One of the points they made concerned how unimaginative Ireland had been in the development of the programme and how we had not capitalised on it.  How does Mr. Keatinge see the programme developing in the next few years?  He said 41 project applications had been funded under it in 2013.  How many applications for funding were submitted in 2013?  How much money was available to be dispersed in that year?  Over the lifetime of the Common Fisheries Policy how much funding will be available for the programme?<\/p> <p>  Deputies &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Martin Ferris mentioned that 80% of those involved in the fishing industry were fishermen with boats under 10 m.  In the annual report there seems to be no mention of them or how they are being supported.  Perhaps the reason is that one of the main priorities of BIM is upscaling.  How will this develop?  Is it BIM's policy to encourage partnerships or rationalisation in the seafood sector?  I come from Killybegs and have seen a great deal of rationalisation in the fish processing sector there which has led to major job losses through modernisation and mechanisation.  This is called progress, but it is very hard to explain to my constituents when they see massive grant aid being announced for processors who are shedding jobs.  I understand the argument on the need to be more competitive in order to survive, but will Mr. Keatinge outline how he sees the process of upscaling developing?  How will it work in tandem with supporting small communities to remain viable within the fishing sector?<\/p><p> I am very interested in hearing how the delegates see us sourcing additional raw material, given the experience of quotas around the country.  I note that BIM has signed a memorandum of understanding with Letterkenny Institute of Technology on an innovation centre in Killybegs.  How do the delegates envisage it developing?  Will BIM be proactive in talking to processors and encouraging them to become involved?  In 2011 Mr. Keatinge was in Killybegs for the big announcement of the creation of 120 or 130 jobs through seafood value added development.  Four years on how many of these jobs have materialised?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#P00200","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427205600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I am largely in agreement with previous speakers, perhaps because of our common experience in developing the report on coastal communities and following our trip to Scotland, where we saw a fishing sector which had achieved the scale Bord Iascaigh Mhara would like to achieve but which also manages to sustain communities in a way that does not seem to be a priority for BIM.<\/p> <p>  I am not from a fishing background; I come from east Clare on the River Shannon and an agricultural background.  However, about a year and a half ago I held a meeting in west Clare, where people come from a fishing background.  They were overwhelmingly negative about BIM and the lack of support from it for communities.  Although I appreciate that there is a general tendency at meetings for people to express negative views, I did not hear very much that was positive about BIM.<\/p> <p>  I do not disagree that we need to grow the sector from its current turnover level of &euro;850 million to in excess of &euro;1 billion.  However, in the next sentence of his opening statement Mr. Keatinge says that to do this, we need large-scale operators.  It seems that the broad policy of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is all about large-scale operators.  Smaller operators are seen as an inconvenience that must be tolerated because of the Common Agricultural Policy and even that policy is interpreted to the greatest extent possible to suit large-scale rather than small operators.  BIM seems to mirror this; as it is within the remit of the Department, that is possibly not an accident.  Is BIM doing anything to bring small producers together to train and help them to develop existing enterprises?  These producers are grounded in their communities and less likely to be mobile, take off and use flags of convenience.<\/p> <p>  The other issue Deputy Thomas Pringle raised concerned the fisheries local area group, FLAG, programme.  I recently travelled with the Chairman to attend meetings at the European Commission.  The Commission was very much in agreement with Deputy Thomas Pringle - I do not know if he will be pleased or disappointed to hear this - on Ireland's failure to use the Common Fisheries Policy to develop and support coastal communities.  As a matter of fact, I have rarely heard Commission officials being as critical of any sector in Ireland as they were about the failure of the FLAG programme.  They were very open in saying Ireland was pretty much at the bottom of the pile.  What does BIM intend to do about this, if anything? <\/p> <p>  The delegates mentioned sustainability as a key objective and that consumers wanted to know that the produce they were eating was sustainable and from where it had come.  One of the mechanisms European consumers increasingly utilise is protected geographical indications.  There are very few such indications in Ireland in the food sector, but the few that we have are in the fishing sector.  Is BIM doing anything or does it plan to do anything in this regard?  There is scope to do a lot.<\/p><p> The downside of the fact that Ireland has not developed its fisheries sector in the way other European states have is that we have a lot of very small producers and small boats, the great majority of which are under 10 m.  The upside is that they all engage in sustainable fishing; they are not able to wipe out an entire species.  About 24 hours would be the maximum length of time they could be at sea before coming back into port.  Is there anything concrete being done to develop geographical areas of origin to help them to market their produce?  The product is sustainable, high end and meets all of the catchwords and so on.  It needs to reach markets in Ireland on the east coast where the population is concentrated but also in the south east of England, Isle de France, Germany and other placee.  What is BIM doing in that regard?<\/p><p> I concur with Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on the scepticism in Scotland about the size of the proposed organic salmon farm in Galway Bay.  It seems to be unparalleled in Scotland where, being much more northerly, ocean temperatures are cooler.  In his opening statement Mr. Keatinge said, \"It is our intention to lease the site to a reputable operator with the necessary capital and expertise to ensure the farm will be run by the strictest of regulatory practices.\"  Who is the reputable operator?  It is quite clear from the wording used that the intention is to lease the site to a particular operator and I have heard there have been discussions.  Has BIM been party to discussions with this reputable operator?  Given that the intention is to lease the site to an operator, how on earth can we claim that the farm will generate a wages flow of around &euro;14.5 million, particularly if all the processing will be done outside Ireland?  Is there any linkage with processing in Ireland and, if so, where exactly on the island of Ireland or in the Republic of Ireland will it be undertaken?  The money generated, at least on finfish farms, is mostly in processing.  Most of the profit and added value is generated there.  This might not be a matter for BIM but for the Department.  Is there any linkage between licensing and processing?  Is there any conditionality that the licensing be subject to processing near the site of the farm in order that the communities that look out at the salmon cages and forgo opportunities to develop their areas for other purposes will at least have the benefit of the processing taking place and wages being paid in them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#Q00200","speaker":"977","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427205600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>There is a range of questions which Mr. Keatinge may wish to share out among his friends.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#R00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427205600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I will try to go through them systematically and will call on my colleagues to help me.  <\/p> <p>  From the outset I suggest we look at a country such as the Netherlands to see what might have happened had we not been diligent in the fishing sector.  In essence, it now has a handful of boats, less than 20, which are among the biggest in the world.  It has taken its entire industry and concentrated it in 20 supertrawlers.  It is to the credit of Ireland that we have maintained a fleet of 2,200 vessels.  If I were to travel to Italy, Spain, Greece or even Norway, I would find an industry dominated by large numbers of small vessels.  My normal job is as head of fisheries and training in BIM and has been for some time.  I am looking at the 2013 report.  In that year we provided 142 grants for fishing vessels.  Last year we provided 1,500, of which I would say 95% were for boats under 20 m.  <\/p> <p>  We introduced the new safety scheme to provide life jackets with a fitted locator beacon, I hope for everybody who goes to sea.

That was part and parcel of allowing us to move the number of grants from 142 in 2013 to 1,500 in 2014.  While messages sometimes are lost, I genuinely think we are sensitive to the needs of the wider sector.

Off the coast of Ireland in 2014, 1.5 million tonnes of fish were taken.  In the Irish economic zone over 500,000 tonnes of fish were taken, somewhat less than 250,000 tonnes by us.  The State has made a huge investment in improving fishing ports such as Killybegs and Castletownbere, but we need to get foreign boats to land.  We can add value by providing for seafood processing and supplying vessels with a range of services.  Ireland must reposition itself in this regard.  The notion that we can go to Brussels, renegotiate the CFP and massively increase our quotas is one for consideration on another day but certainly not in my lifetime.

Nowadays blue whiting, mackerel, horse mackerel and others are predominantly being landed in Ireland.  In 2013 we were able to secure an extra 65,000 blue whiting landed by Norwegian and other non-Irish vessels, which actually meant the plants in Killybegs were running well into the spring.

These numbers are achievable.<\/p> <p>  There were several questions on scaling the sector and I will ask some of my colleagues to come in on some of these points.  However, the overarching point I will make is it is not the intention of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, to replace the entirety of the Irish processing sector with two or three megacompanies.  That said, however, I believe the farming tradition has shown us that one must have some companies of sufficient scale if one is to compete at international level.  This can be done in a number of ways.  Is it our intention to entice in foreign companies?  Certainly not.  That is not what we have been about.  Have we looked at creating groupings in areas such as accessing new markets?  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Donal Buckley, to talk a little about the work we have been doing into China.  It is a really good example of where we are going in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427205600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Perhaps I can talk at three levels above the way we look at scale.  First, we look at scale when we look at export companies as we need significant size to be able to compete effectively.  Since 2010, the processing sector has added &euro;146 million in exports and that has created more than 340 jobs in coastal processors.  A good example is the work we are doing in China.  Somebody asked about consolidation and rationalisation and our model is to create co-operation and alliances.  For example, into China, we have assisted companies to create joint ventures where they have brought together their resources and have stopped the internal competition and giving away value but rather are trying to get the efficiency and the marketing.  This has been highly successful.  We started with a couple of million euro two or three years ago and this year, we will be up at &euro;24 million.  It is adding this sort of value and if I can convert what creating growth means in terms of jobs, for every million euro of revenue growth we get, we will get three to four direct jobs and six indirect jobs in pubs and in the local economy.  Overall, that is ten jobs per million euro and that is why we are driving on with growth.  Moreover, growth comes from both the volume and the raw material with the value added.  As for value added, we do a lot in our new seafood product development centre in Clonakilty, where we help companies convert their ideas into good business through new product development or packaging or how they take them to market.<\/p> <p>  I spoke about exports and the second level pertains to the domestic economy and how we look at helping companies.  Again, we bring companies into our seafood development centre to give them skills.  These are either technical skills, such as filleting the fish in small processors or in respect of retailers, how they present their fish and how they handle the quality.  Some of my colleagues ran a seaweed workshop a couple of months ago at which 200 small-scale entrepreneurs came in to ascertain how they might develop their business.  All these activities are driving the overall sector upwards.  It is not just a case of one size fitting all but is a roadmap whereby all companies can advance their business.  This is what we are trying to do regarding scale for exporting and regional companies that can build their resources and can add one or two employees per business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#U00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427205600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Buckley.  I will make one other point in respect of fisheries local action groups, FLAGs.  Last year I mentioned that we had gone from a small number of 41 projects in 2013 up to 450 projects last year and no eligible project was turned down.  We have set an upper limit on projects but I hasten to add, regarding the FLAG structure we have put in place, that one reason they are looking at us in Europe is we did take a different tack.  If one considers the United Kingdom, there is a FLAG in Cornwall but one then goes approximately 100 miles up the coast to the next FLAG, after which one goes round the corner up the east coast to the next FLAG.  England has approximately six FLAGs, probably covering less than 15% of its coastline.  I believe we stood up and told the European Commission that we would not follow this model.  Everywhere on the Irish coast can be part of a FLAG with the obvious exception of the major urban areas, where technically one simply cannot operate.<\/p><p>However, we extend it right into Howth and then start it again just south of Bray.  It was a different approach and I stand over it.  To me, it is crucial that no single area along the coast should be singled out specially and told it will get preferential treatment.  Any person living in a coastal community should be able to access fisheries local action group, FLAG, funds and that is the model we have delivered.  The second point I will make is that anybody living in a coastal area should be able to put himself or herself forward for inclusion on the FLAG committee or board.  In association with the FLAGs, we also have developed regional inshore fisheries forums.  Again, that is taking from the work of this joint committee to give a new voice to inshore fishermen and consequently, the FLAGs now are sponsoring the regional inshore fisheries forums.  They then send two members each from the six regions to the national inshore forum.  For the first time since 2009, when our lobster management plan in a sense collapsed, we now have inshore fishermen getting a new voice in how fisheries are to be managed in the future.  Let me be clear in this regard.  We are here dealing with lobster, crab, scallop and a lot of stocks that, by and large, fall outside the day-to-day remit of the European Commission.  Essentially, they are managed by Ireland and we believe fundamentally that this management can only operate successfully if a bottom-up approach is taken.  Despite what the Commission may have told members, I challenge the Commission to come here and let us show it what we have done.  In Ireland, we are unique in Europe, in that every coastal community can be part of a FLAG and every FLAG has a regional inshore fisheries forum and each such forum can send delegates to the national forum in Dublin.  As a result, for the first time the quota management committee, which for many years was the preserve of the big vessel owner, now has two members from the national inshore fisheries forum.  Inshore fishermen now are represented on quota management.  The operational programme for the new maritime fisheries fund will meet for the first time in May.  Inshore fishermen now have two seats specifically representing the inshore small-scale boats.

I was proud to serve on the Leader committee for the islands&rsquo; Leader group, Comhar na nOile&aacute;n.

It is important that we discuss the wider issue of aquaculture and where it is going.  I believe aquaculture can provide new opportunities in coastal areas.

I will answer Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s questions first which included many of those points.  To answer his specific point, the application remains outstanding so on that basis we are pursuing the project and await the Minister&rsquo;s determination.  He also mentioned that several salmon farm licences have run their course and are awaiting consideration for renewal under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  It is not an ideal situation but it does provide a legal cover to continue to operate and that is the important point.  With regard to the scale of the project we have been discussing I am very familiar with the Scottish salmon farming industry having worked in it for many years.<\/p><p>I am very aware of how it operates.  A water body the size of Galway Bay on the west coast of Scotland would already have 30,000 or 40,000 tonnes of salmon production.  Galway Bay was unusual in not having any production which made it possible to have a large operation.  While in Scotland there may not be a single operator in one location at that scale, within a water body of that size there would be multiples of that level of production.  <\/p><p> There are now two farms operating on the island of Faroe in Norway that are bigger than the one we have proposed.  Already the technology is moving along and other countries have moved to consider this.  What might have been seen as an adventurous approach is becoming commonplace in other countries. <\/p><p> In answer to the questions about storm damage, fortuitously during the worst of the storms the Christmas before last we had a waverider buoy located on the sites which gave us direct measured information on the real wave climate during that one in 100 years storm.  Reassuringly, the wave climate was within a couple of centimetres of what had been predicted in the environmental impact study.  On that basis the equipment that was specified in the study, all things being equal, should have been up to the job of containing the fish and surviving the storms.  What happened was what we predicted would happen and the equipment proposed in those studies would have been specified to deal with a wave climate of that magnitude.  We have real, heavy duty, factual evidence because the measuring devices were on site. <\/p><p> Deputy Ferris asked some very searching questions about recirculating aquaculture systems, RAS, or pump ashore systems as they are commonly known.  BIM is very much abreast of what is happening in that area.  We have several systems operating in Ireland already.  This boils down to whether we can have large scale seawater systems for the production of big volumes of table fish.  We already have very successful RAS type systems for the production of juvenile salmon.  High value juvenile or small volume fish work very well in these systems.  BIM has grant-aided several of them and we are very pleased with their operation.  We have recently assisted in the production of two major studies, one a feasibility study by an individual who is considering establishing one of these farms and another a theoretical study.  We are finding that the technology for large scale food production in these systems is not yet at a point where it can be seen either as reliable or as economically viable.  We are watching it very closely, if we think there is an opportunity there we will immediately get involved in it.<\/p><p> To respond to Deputy McNamara&rsquo;s questions, I have mentioned Scotland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#W01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427205600,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I asked about temperature differences between Norway, Scotland and Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#X00200","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427205600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>There is some difference in water temperature and in the environment in which salmon are grown.

It has been demonstrated year in year out.  In recent years the Scots have suffered the same environmental disadvantages as the Irish in terms of amoebic gill disease and other issues.  We are all dealing with the same issues.  There is no doubt because of the availability of very deep sheltered sea water in Norway it is easier to farm salmon there than in Ireland but we can do it very successfully.

As the Deputy is aware the history is complex.  I refer to the negative judgment against Ireland in the European Court of Justice in 2007 where the Irish system was found to be non-compliant with the requirements of the birds and habitats directives.  In the meantime a number of other issues have arisen.  The Department is working very hard to attempt to bring the licensing system into compliance and BIM plays a major part in that initiative, along with colleagues in the Marine Institute and other agencies.  I agree with the Deputy that it is unfortunate that the operators find themselves in this situation.  It is difficult from our point of view, in so far as we cannot give them the assistance we would like to give because they are not fully licensed in the sense that the Deputy refers to.  This makes for a very difficult situation all around.<\/p> <p>  The second issue raised by the Deputy was the question of the attitude of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and IFI, Inland Fisheries Ireland, with regard to both the Galway Bay project and salmon farming in general.  It is a very difficult situation.  IFI, unfortunately, has a history of objecting to every single salmon farm application that has every been lodged.  It has a particular point of view.  We take our science and technology advice from the same quarter as the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is the Marine Institute.  The institute is clear that the central issue is that of sea lice and the interaction between farmed salmonids and wild salmonids and that is that the sea lice are a minor and irregular component.  This is what has decided our position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#Z01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1427205600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Does the Government have a collective view?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#Z01400","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427205600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>That is a matter on which I cannot comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#Z01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1427205600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Two Departments are totally at odds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#Z01600","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1427205600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy that they have always been at odds.

In Ireland, approximately 70% of all the seafood we eat is cod or salmon and 60% of that is imported.  That is a telling indictment - that as a seafood nation we are that heavily reliant on imports.<\/p> <p>  Another point we make continually, and I will come back to it again, is that we should channel our energy at creating a structured approach to aquaculture and striving to do so in an organic, environmentally sensitive and sustainable fashion.  I believe we should take this approach and that these are the discussions BIM is and should be having with its colleagues in the Marine Institute and in Inland Fisheries Ireland.  We must realign the national conversation around aquaculture and say there can be jobs, but they must be done properly.  That is where we need to focus the debate in the future.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned the agrifood strategy 2025 and setting challenging targets within that is important.  We come back time and again to the fact that we have a limited quota and that stocks must be fished sustainably.  Therefore, we come back to the three issues I have raised: additional foreign landings from the 1.5 million tonnes taken off our coastline; targeting previously unused quota; and the discard ban that will come in over the next couple of years, from which new opportunities will arise.  New opportunities will also arise from aquaculture.<\/p> <p>  I would like to address a number of other questions.

It is all down to distribution of the quotas.  When a very small number of vessels is the beneficiary of a national quota then one has a serious problem.  The committee heard there were 60,000 dairy producers 15 to 20 years ago and now there are 17,000.  One could ask whether that is beneficial to the country and what the social consequences are for affected areas.  The same is true of fishing.  The mackerel quota has been ring-fenced.  Approximately 23 boats have the entire national mackerel quota.  The herring quota is now being ring-fenced.  At the same time, 2,000 vessels are struggling to survive.  The policy is wrong.  Far more people would benefit if the quotas were fairly distributed.  The observation was made that last year Irish boats landed 250,000 tonnes of fish compared to 25,000 tonnes of fish in 1972.  The reality is that many more people were involved in landing 25,000 tonnes of fish than currently land 250,000 tonnes.

There are three levels of activity.  We spoke about blue whiting.  There are approximately 1 million tonnes of blue whiting off the Irish coast in different forms.  Our intention is to attract in additional foreign landings into processors in Killybegs to produce fillets.  Killybegs processors have made significant investments in that regard supported by State grant aid.  That allows us to produce fillets and commodities for Africa.  Second, the option we are also considering is protein surimi products which is high value added.  It involves producing various imitation products one sees on the market such as crab sticks.<\/p><p> Bio-marine ingredients are a real game changer.  Seafood proteins, in particular in Asia, are really important.  We are leading the charge with these new products.  We have looked at the markets and have got a very exciting response from them in terms of proteins.  These will go into health and nutritional products, high-end pet care items and ingredients in other food products.  It also enables one to produce high quality oils which come out of this new boarfish resource which is a difficult fish for human consumption but which works very nicely when one breaks it down into these high-end ingredients and protein oils.  That is in fruition and in planning and is likely to yield significant new employment and a new facility in Killybegs in the next year to 18 months.<\/p><p> The third aspect is commodities in Killybegs.  We are really trying to open up more value added activities.  Next month we will have a workshop in Killybegs in which we will look at futuristic ideas and try to work with processors on what more they might do with the product in terms of more value and more employment.  We think Killybegs is quite open to these possibilities and would be very confident about the future not only in regard to the existing resource and existing employment but in growing significantly the sector.  I hope that gives some confidence in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#DD01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427205600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Some 20 years ago, Ireland had no blue whiting quota and ten years ago, every blue whiting we landed went straight to fishmeal.

With everybody's co-operation, I hope the committee will be able to discuss the 2014 annual report in this calendar year rather than in the next one, although the next calendar year might be a bit hectic.<\/p> <p>  I would like to make some observations in conclusion.  The sub-committee, which I chaired, included members from the Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications because of the cross-over.  It focused on the smaller fleet in the context of trying to protect dispersed rural communities along the coast and on the islands.  A very pertinent point was made in terms of looking at Holland and what might have been if there had not been any intervention.  There is always that pull to rationalise and to consolidate at a cost to rural communities, the environment and animal welfare in the case of animals and perhaps similarly in the case of fish.  That is why the report made recommendations and the inshore fisheries forums are certainly a step in the right direction.  The marine conference held last year was planned but we would have recommended that sort of forum be established.<\/p> <p>  In the context of keeping many smaller operators in place so that island and rural communities can survive, if one wants to keep them small but to sell large, one must collaborate.  That is the one thing we learned from the shellfish people, in particular Scotland.  Is there merit in looking at co-operatives to a greater degree?  I am a layman and have nothing to do with aquaculture.<\/p><p>Mr. Maguire referred to a body of water with 15,000 tonnes.  If that was broken down, along the Norwegian or the Scottish lines, into 5,000 tonne parcels, could it be an alternative model?  I am just raising that.  Could we look at establishing co-operatively owned fish farms which would give the people of the community a sense of ownership of them?<\/p><p> In Galway, people have been given shares in some of the wind farm projects, so everyone gets a benefit.  There is a likelihood that processing would take place nearby, notwithstanding all the reasoned, rational and business reasons one would do so anyway.<\/p><p> We did not really mention shellfish farming but it seems to have a role.  The people we met in Scotland had a distribution depot on the ring road around Glasgow and they controlled the supply chain to all the major multiples, which is a bit of reversal but it certainly seemed to be effective.  We were in Oban.  We also visited the equivalent of our Marine Institute, Scottish Marine Science, which was doing a lot of research on multi-species aquaculture fish farms, so that one species fed off the waste and one had a cleaner and more natural environment.  Along with other matters, that is probably one for the future.  We should keep a watchful eye on this.  <\/p><p> I thank members for sticking with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015032400002#EE00300","speaker":"1103","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427205600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 4.35 p.m. until 3.15 p.m. on Tuesday, 31 March 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","time":1427203800,"counter":168},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Joint Committee met at 13:30<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Dara Calleary, Senator Michael Mullins, Deputy Michael Conaghan, Senator Feargal Quinn.

The general scheme of the Bill was approved by Government in January, and, together with a regulatory impact assessment, has been published on my Department's website and forwarded to the committee.<\/p>  <p>  It is fair to say that we have seen a paradigm shift in the economy over the past few months.  Unemployment has dropped by a third since 2012, reaching its lowest level in six years, and it may dip below 9% over the next 12 months.  The number of jobs has increased cumulatively by nearly 100,000 since the low point of the crisis, with 29,100 net new jobs having been created in the last year alone, of which most are full-time, as evidenced in CSO reports.  The Exchequer deficit at the end of February stood at &euro;205 million compared with &euro;1.7 billion at the same time last year.  Tax revenue has increased by &euro;925 million, primarily as a result of the improving economy.  The social protection bill has fallen by &euro;240 million in line with falling unemployment levels.  Our debt servicing costs have fallen by 17.8% over the year.<\/p>  <p>  These figures illustrate the success of the Government's twin-track approach of creating the conditions for job growth and helping people back to work.  The Action Plan for Jobs is accelerating Ireland's transition to a sustainable jobs-rich economy, while the Pathways to Work programme is ensuring that as many people as possible who take up work are from the live register.  There are, however, far too many people still jobless, and we are working to build on the success to date and create full employment within the next three years.<\/p>  <p>  One consequence of the beginning of the recovery that can be seen is that workers feel that recovery should be reflected in wage packets.  A return to wage bargaining is already visible in certain sectors of the economy.  IBEC's recent pay survey found that 57% of companies plan to increase basic pay in 2015.  According to that survey, the median pay increase is set to be 2%.  Other surveys suggest this figure might be higher.  Making work pay is a cornerstone of this Government's agenda, and the setting up of a low pay commission was one of the key commitments in the statement of Government priorities agreed between the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste in July last.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, the national minimum wage can be adjusted currently by ministerial order following a recommendation in a national agreement, under section 12; in the absence of such a recommendation, following an examination and recommendation by the Labour Court on foot of a request by a substantially representative organisation of employees or employers, as provided for in section 13; or unilaterally by the Minister, under section 11, whether or not a recommendation under section 12 or 13 has been made, taking into account a number of criteria set down explicitly in the 2000 Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Economic and Social Research Institute, in its 2006 analysis of the last Labour Court recommendation proposing an increase to the national minimum wage, concluded that adjusting the minimum wage by a substantial amount on an irregular basis, with lengthy gaps between increases, as happened in the past, rather than having regular, smaller and fairly predictable pay rises, is more likely to have a detrimental impact on employment and contribute to uncertainty for employers and actual and potential employees.  <\/p>  <p>               The most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office's quarterly earnings, hours and employment costs survey show that 4.7% of all employees, or just over 73,000 workers, were being paid the adult experienced national minimum wage rate of &euro;8.65 per hour or less in quarter 2 of 2014.  Throughout the crisis the Government has been committed to maintaining employment rights, particularly those protecting the most vulnerable workers in our society.  In many cases those rights are being enhanced.  Where changes have been made or new legislation introduced, we have sought to improve them.  On low pay alone, one of the first actions of this Government was to restore the minimum wage to the level that existed before the last Government cut it by &euro;1 shortly before it left office.<\/p> <p> The low pay commission, which will be chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, was officially launched on Wednesday 26 February by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and myself to operate on an interim administrative basis, and the commission held its first meeting the same day.  The principal function of the low pay commission will be, on an annual basis, to examine and make recommendations to the Minister of the day on the national minimum wage, with a view to ensuring that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time, having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.<\/p> <p> Alongside examining the national minimum wage, the low pay commission will also be asked to examine matters related generally to the functions of the commission under the Act.  This work programme will be agreed by Government and presented to the commission in February of each year.  In addition, in the discharging of its function, the commission will be required to make recommendations that are evidence-based using a suite of agreed data sets or, where required, based on bespoke research undertaken at the behest of the commission.  This approach draws on that adopted in the UK, where, since 1997, the recommendations of the UK Low Pay Commission have brought about a progressive increase in the minimum wage that has had little detrimental effect on the functioning of the economy or the labour market.  In this context, I would like to express my thanks to the Chairman of the UK Low Pay Commission, David Norgrove, and his colleagues in the UK working in this area who, in recent months, have so freely given of their own experience and time during the preparatory work we have undertaken in establishing our own commission.<\/p> <p> The commission will be statutorily independent in the performance of its functions.  While not provided for in the general scheme of the Bill, it is intended that the low pay commission will adopt a consensus-based approach to its reports and recommendations.  Work should always pay, but I am also conscious of the need to balance a basic statutory minimum pay rate that is fair with one that is sustainable and that allows employers to continue to create high-quality jobs.  In this context, a particular function of the commission will be to ensure that any advice or recommendations it makes to the Government is evidence-based, utilising agreed data obtained by carrying out research and consultations with employers, workers and their representatives and taking written and oral evidence from a wide range of organisations.  This is to ensure that any suggested changes to the national minimum wage have minimum adverse effects on employment and competitiveness.<\/p> <p> It is important to note that, alongside this hard data, the commission will consult with people - workers and employers - who are directly affected by the national minimum wage.  This real lived experience will be vital for the commissioners when deciding what rate the national minimum wage should be.  The commission has already commenced its work.  As members will be aware, the low pay commission recently asked for submissions from members of the public and interested parties.  The closing date for receipt of submissions will be 5 p.m on Monday 13 April.  I expect that the commission will submit its first report to me by the middle of July.<\/p> <p> The changes proposed in establishing the low pay commission on a statutory basis are essentially taking much of the politics out of setting the national minimum wage.  It is very much in keeping with the dignity of work agenda that I am pursuing, and it complements other work such as the study on zero hours contracts and low hours contracts by the University of Limerick which we have commissioned and which has just commenced.<\/p> <p> The heads of the Bill are largely self-explanatory, and given the limited time we have today, I do not intend to go through them individually.  I am happy to clarify any particular issues which might arise and which members may wish to raise now.  If any issues arise in the future, they may feel free to contact me or my officials.<\/p> <p> It is appropriate to draw members' attention to head 4.  <\/p>  <p>               As it was decided to establish the low pay commission, LPC, on an interim basis in the first instance, transitional provisions were included in head 4 to ensure that the activities, reports, associated costs and membership of the non-statutory basis LPC would be regarded as activities, reports, associated costs and membership of the statutory LPC on the coming into effect of the Act.  However, subsequent examination of the issue and legal advice obtained from the Attorney General has indicated that as the LPC will have been established on a statutory basis before any recommendation with regard to the minimum wage is made, such provisions are not in fact required.  On that basis, I propose not to include them in the published Bill.  I was anxious to bring the members' attention to that.<\/p> <p> Again, I thank you, Chairman, for undertaking the pre-legislative scrutiny process on this important Bill and I look forward to hearing the views of committee members on the general scheme.  It will assist us in our job of drafting the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#C00200","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Thank you.

Equally, there is nobody on the board who has ever been a direct employer or run a small business and known the pressures that come with having to manage it.

There is a range of different areas the low pay commission could potentially examine.  I have asked the commission to focus exclusively over the next short period of time on the next rate of the national minimum wage.  It is an important job and the commission has been given a tight timeframe in which to do it.  However, the commission will be asked to look at other areas of the economy that may be synonymous with low pay, carrying out evidence based research into that and, indeed, making recommendations to the Government.  For the next short period of time, however, it will focus exclusively on the task at hand, which is to recommend the rate for the national minimum wage.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy made a point about asking the low pay commission essentially to set the rate.  It is important that the Government should always have a view on where the rate of the national minimum wage should go.  We will ask the low pay commission to carry out its work in an evidence based way, and this is a timely opportunity for it to do that.  To be frank, there would be a constitutional issue if it were the case that the low pay commission would be acting at large, as it were, and simply making a recommendation without any parliamentary oversight.  <\/p>  <p>               We have seen the attitude of the courts in recent years to various industrial relations legislative measures that were considered to be unconstitutional due to the lack of parliamentary oversight.<\/p> <p> The Oireachtas should have a view on what the rate of the national minimum wage should be.  Ultimately, it will be a decision for the Minister of the day, me in this case, to bring to the Cabinet and to the Oireachtas, and everybody here should have a view on it.  We are asking the low pay commission to do a very important job.  It is closely modelled on the UK experience, which has worked very well and has had significant buy-in from trade unions, employers and civil society organisations who have confidence in the UK Low Pay Commission to carry out its work in a dutiful, open, transparent and evidence-based manner.<\/p> <p> In addition, we wish to ensure that the low pay commission is sufficiently well equipped and sufficiently protected in legislation to ensure that if and when the next recession hits the first target will not be those who are on low pay, and that a Government does not decide simply to train its guns on people who are on low pay and merely existing on the minimum wage.  Unfortunately, that happened in recent times and I have no wish to see it happen again.  We will now have a statutory organisation dealing with this in an evidence-based way on an annual basis.<\/p> <p> In terms of the membership of the low pay commission, I am satisfied with the composition of the commission, as is the Government.  We went through a detailed, open and transparent process with the public appointments system.  There were over 150 applications.  The committee will be familiar with the names of the members, which have been circulated and published.  These are people in whom I have every confidence.  They have a track record in representing employees and employers and a strong track record in civil society.  I do not know if any of the members of the low pay commission has ever worked on the minimum wage - I do not believe Deputy Calleary can say that with any great confidence either; nobody can - or whatever their other experiences might be, but I am confident that we have selected the right people through a public process to assist the Government in this very important work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#E00600","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as ucht a chur i l&aacute;thair.  We have heard the Minister state a number of times that he is seeking to take politics out of the setting of the low pay commission.  Given that poverty, inequality and low wages are currently entrenched in the economy, many would say that the Labour Party has been successful in taking politics out of its time in Government.  Politics must be at the heart of these decisions.  One goes to the people, tells them what one will do and then one delivers.  That is the political way.  The problem is that this is not a low pay commission, but a minimum wage commission.  It is not looking at low pay in its entirety.

He also said it is to look at general issues associated with low pay.  Again, a Minister with a political direction should be giving direction to these individuals with regard to exactly what they should be examining.<\/p>  <p>  The problem I have is that it appears we are inventing a typewriter here, while Britain is already looking at inventing an iPad.  What I mean is that in Britain they have already come to the decision.  People such as Alan Buckle and Sir George Bain, who have major experience with the functioning of the commission in Britain, have written extensively and looked at the inadequacies of it.  They have seen that low pay is still entrenched in the British economy.  Has the Minister read Alan Buckle's independent report, Low Pay: The Nation's Challenge, or Sir George Bain on the national minimum wage issue?  I will outline what I mean by the broader context of low pay.  There are sectors of society that are hammered with low pay.  These include younger workers, women and migrants.  Is it not necessary to provide in the legislation and in the specific remit of the commission that it examine the experiences of these people and identify policies that will resolve those experiences?  <\/p>  <p>                 Also, it was stated at the International Labour Organization, ILO, minimum wage fixing convention that there is a suite of other issues to do with low pay.  A proper public service, for example, helps people who are in poverty, those suffering from inequality and those on low pay and the delivery of proper public services can lift those individuals out of that.  If it is to do what it says on the tin, so to speak, would it not be logical to also task the commission to examine how these tools can be used to resolve the problem of low pay for people?  The Council of Europe has indicated that there are problems with sub-minimum wage rates, etc.  Should that not be examined also?<\/p> <p> The Minister and I have had many debates on the fact that there is a major lack of enforcement powers with regard to the minimum wage in this State.  We have had the Kishoge affair and a number of other cases where workers were earning less than the minimum wage.  There are enforcement processes in the State but those are so slow they are no longer effective for workers.  If political direction was at the heart of this issue, the Labour Party would be tasking the low pay commission to ensure that enforcement happens.  <\/p> <p> Is it not necessary to build a low pay commission on the basis of the experience of people in other countries such as Britain, which is now looking at reforming what is a 15 year old, outdated institution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#F00400","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I find it extraordinary that while this is one of the most important initiatives any government has taken to address low pay, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and his party cannot find it in themselves to welcome it.

The reality is that the Labour Party in government, and this Government in general, is committed to making sure that work pays, that it is valued in society and that it is rewarded.  The Deputy will be aware that we are commissioning a study on zero hour contracts as well.<\/p>  <p>  The experience in Northern Ireland is interesting, with 32,000 people existing on zero hour contracts and tens of thousands more existing on low hour contracts, yet we have heard nothing but rhetoric from the member opposite on that issue.  In terms of the experience of the Administration in which his party plays a central role in Northern Ireland, it is far from a utopian picture.  <\/p>  <p>  We are very serious about dealing with issues pertaining to low pay.  The Deputy seems to have misheard me, or at least misrepresented me.  For the coming period it is the exclusive job of the low pay commission to set the rate of the national minimum wage for next year.  That is a major piece of work.  The national minimum wage has not been reviewed to any great degree since 2007.  It is timely that is done.  <\/p>  <p>  There may well be an expectation that because there have been pay increases across the private sector of 2% to 3%, broadly speaking, in the past 12 to 18 months, people on the minimum wage should experience an increase as well.  The right way to do public policy making, and if we are to learn anything from the lessons of the past, is to task a statutory organisation like the low pay commission to do that work in an evidence-based way that will stand up to scrutiny and is informed by the best practices of social dialogue while making convincing arguments, using evidence and bringing employers, trade unions and civil society organisations with us.  <\/p>  <p>  I ask people to ditch their pessimism and cynicism and give this low pay commission the opportunity to do the job it has been tasked to do.  The Deputy seems to have very little faith or confidence in the National Employment Rights Agency.  I beg to differ.  NERA has done an excellent job of work, for example, in terms of its legislation enforcing payment of the national minimum wage.<\/p>  <p>  The matter the Deputy referred to earlier, Kishoge, is an entirely different matter.  I agree with him that there are issues in regard to charges of bogus self-employment and so on.  It is an issue that has to be settled at European level.  It is a very important matter for European nation states and something that needs to be addressed.  We are serious about dealing with issues to do with low pay, the minimum wage and making sure that work pays so I ask people to park their cynicism, back the low pay commission, not make narrow political points, work with the commission and make their own submission to it before 13 April in terms of how they see it operating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#G00200","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>The Minister has made a number of points.

People who were formerly chief executive officers of that commission concluded that to have a narrow focus on the minimum wage only does not address low pay.  I understand there may be an opportunity in the future for a broadening of that focus beyond the minimum wage but I suggest the Minister should give our commission a concrete direction in terms of those issues because it is unlikely he will be in that position next year when this organisation has published its first report.

Some present here today have established various fora on the living wage but I do not believe they are serious about it because they have never bothered to engage with a single employer on it.

In some ways I do not feel very well equipped to be here and to comment in detail on the heads of the Bill.  I circulated some material and will illustrate the key points in respect of that.<\/p>  <p>  I will start with the arguments for and against having a minimum wage and the things that need to be taken into account in designing it and amending or changing it.  It can prevent exploitation, play a key role in tackling in-work poverty and encourages companies to compete on quality not price.  Better paid staff tend to work more productively.  It prevents the bad employer relying on the State to top up poverty wages but there are things that need to be taken into account as well and reasons for caution.  If the labour market is competitive, and that is a big &ldquo;if&rdquo;, any wage floor will have some negative impact on employment.  There may be problems of maintaining differentials which are costly.  There may be adverse effects on prices, business closures, etc.  Most important, if there are adverse effects the most vulnerable groups in the labour market are likely to be most affected.  Caution is merited.<\/p>  <p>  In the background material I distributed I drew attention, albeit briefly, to the variety of experience in other European countries and made some specific reference to the UK experience because it is of particular relevance and interest in this case.  Over the past 15 or 20 years the UK has moved towards the centre of gravity of the European experience, having at one stage been an outlier without a statutory minimum wage, although it had a long history of some minimum wage protection.  It now takes care to involve social partners in the discussion, which is important although it is done in different ways in other countries.<\/p>  <p>  Many would say that if collective bargaining functioned effectively it would be fine to leave it to the unions and employers.  We know there are areas of the economy where collective bargaining cannot function effectively.  That is why it is important to have some State intervention and protection.  That centrality of the social partners is important in Britain as elsewhere.  <\/p>  <p>         The success, and I do think it has been a success in the UK, has been in establishing an embedding of the system.  What is a relatively recent political innovation, if one takes the long view, has now become largely accepted as a successful way of dealing with the issue.  This is perhaps because people tempered their ambitions at the outset and thought it was worth investing in having something which would endure and remain in force in the longer run.  It has now survived a change of Government and a very deep recession.  It has worked by consensus and it has worked on the basis of evidence.  All those things have been important.  <\/p> <p> I suspect I am coming towards the close of my few minutes.  Perhaps my final remark would be to go back to the scope and ambition for a minimum wage, having heard the very interesting exchanges earlier.  In the UK, it is very clearly a wage floor and it does not claim to be a total answer by any means to issues of poverty in society or wider questions of inequality.  It could be claimed and it could also be disputed that there are other policies in place to address those things adequately.  It is a big ask for a single policy of a national minimum wage to address all of those things.  There is therefore merit in having different policies, taxes and benefits and having public services look at the other elements as well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Foden","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I now invite Ms Gr&aacute;inne O'Toole, workplace rights and forced labour co-ordinator at the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, to make her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#L00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak here today.  The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland is a national non-government organisation which works with families and migrant workers who have low pay and who are very vulnerable to exploitation and discrimination.  We provide a free and confidential drop-in centre.  Last year, we dealt with more than 2,000 cases.  We also provide a range of outreach activities targeting more than 2,000 additional people each year.  We have a long track record in working on issues of low pay, exploitation and lack of enforcement of rights.<\/p>  <p>  To reiterate what was said earlier about Ireland having a serious low pay problem, I will not reel out the statistics but there are substantiated statistics from which we are learning more about the entrenched nature of the problem here.  In looking at the regulatory impact assessment and the heads of Bill, we are confining our comments to the scope and the function of the low pay commission.  We welcome the initiative of establishing the low pay commission.  We have long believed that an increase in the minimum wage is overdue and we are looking forward to seeing what evidence-based recommendations will be made.  We also know from the UK experience that the increase in minimum wage did not have an adverse effect on unemployment.  This is an important and good starting point.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the precariousness of people's work in the low pay sector, which is characterised by insecure hours and zero-hour contracts, lack of progression and exploitation, the issues surrounding low pay are grave in some sectors.  This is particularly so in the more non-regulated sectors.  We therefore need to be ambitious in trying to address these issues.  <\/p>  <p>  We feel that it was the intention in the Government's priorities to establish the low pay commission as an independent body.  At the moment, there is nothing in the way the heads of Bill are constructed that gives this aspect any kind of protection.  We have seen the undermining of institutions such as the Equality Authority over the past number of years.  If there was a change in Government and it was not interested in low pay issues and they became less of a priority, there is no safeguard in the way the low pay commission is currently being constructed to protect its integrity and independence.  We would like to see this addressed.  We would like to see the low pay commission having a relationship with the Oireachtas but we would like to see more work on this relationship.  <\/p>  <p>           The Government's priorities included having the low pay commission examine minimum wage issues.  It is clear this will happen and that this will be its priority over the first year, but it was also to look at other related matters.  Our concern is that this is not reflected in the heads of Bill in terms of the functions of the low pay commission contained in head 2.  The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland believes that we should be more ambitious given the prevalence of the low pay issue and recommends that related matters should be provided for in the Bill and the definition of what this means expanded.  The Bill should set out exactly what these related matters would be.  We also recommend that the low pay commission would act more as a watchdog-type organisation which could seek to support the Government in setting a target to eliminate low pay. <\/p> <p> Lessons can be learned from the UK experience.  A detailed review of the UK Low Pay Commission was conducted by the Resolution Foundation.  The UK commission achieved what it set out to do and I have no doubt that our commission will do the same.  The UK Low Pay Commission managed to increase minimum wages.  However, it was also highlighted that there was a shortfall because the UK commission did not manage to address the pervasive issue of low pay.  <\/p> <p> Our concerns surround the narrowness of the remit and trying to tackle the minimum wage on its own.  Focusing on extreme low pay is a restrictive approach.  We have an opportunity now and the commission should be more ambitious.  I will finish on three recommendations we have.  The Government should set a goal for the elimination of low pay.  The remit of the low pay commission should be expanded to become a watchdog on low pay and the low pay commission should have powers to set targets to reduce low pay across a number of policy areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Gr&aacute;inne O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I now call on Ms Alice-Mary Higgins, policy officer at the National Women's Council of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#M00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present.  The establishment of a low pay commission is a positive step and a very welcome recognition of the problem of low pay in Ireland.  It is critically important that the commission will have a strong gender perspective in its analysis and recommendations.  We know from our members and from statistics that this is an issue which affects women in particular.  Some 60% of people on low pay are women and 50% of women in Ireland are currently earning &euro;20,000 or less.  Many of the sectors in which women predominate have been at the frontline of often aggressive casualisation in terms of the erosion of wages and hours.  We have a clear indicator of this in that Ireland's gender pay gap is now widening from 12.6% in 2009 to 14.4% currently.  Historically, one of the only measures which has narrowed this gap was the original introduction of the minimum wage.  This is therefore of crucial importance for the council.  <\/p>  <p>  I would love to discuss these issues in detail but we have been asked to focus on the heads of Bill.  The National Women's Council of Ireland have a number of concerns and suggested amendments to the wording of the legislation which should be considered in order to ensure that the Bill genuinely delivers the scope and ambition for the commission which is in the spirit of the Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  Head 2, section 12, sets out the functions of the commission.  Subsection 2 lists a number of items to which, in making a recommendation, the commission shall have regard.  Given the gender concerns I have outlined, the council believes it is crucial that the low pay commission should be mandated in this section to have regard to gender equality and other equality factors, as a named aspect, in its deliberations.  As well as the key issues of gender equality, explicit regard to equality would also be appropriate in line with the new positive duty which requires all public bodies, including presumably newly formed bodies, to have regard to equality in their operations.  The detail of the recommendations is listed in the written submissions and I will therefore not enumerate them now.  <\/p>  <p>  In regard to looking at low pay, anyone would recognise that it is crucial to look at the cost of living as experienced by workers.  However, there is an anomaly in the current phrasing of the Bill.  Cost of living is not named as an overall area to which the commission should have regard.  It is a subparagraph of paragraph (g) which provides for looking at the potential effects that an order might have on the cost of living.  The problem is that, as currently phrased, the commission is not being asked to consider the impact the cost of living should have on a minimum wage, but rather the impact a minimum wage might have on the cost of living.  <\/p>  <p>         This is an anomaly or oversight that should be addressed.  The cost of living should be listed as a concern in its own right and it should be high up on that list.  We would recommend it as the second concern.<\/p> <p> We feel two other areas should be included in matters of which regard should be taken.  One that was previously mentioned was in-work poverty levels.  It is a very concrete measure.  It is clearly part of the motivation behind the Bill and it should be listed as something on which the commission is deliberating when making its recommendations.  We know now that 16% of those below the poverty line are currently in work and that is a real concern.<\/p> <p> We draw attention to the social and economic impact of wage levels and the associated cost or benefit to the State.  Again, that is a concrete measure to be considered when we look, for example, at the level of reliance on family income supplement from the Department of Social Protection.  It would behove the low pay commission to look wider than the employment context and at the wider socio-economic costs of low pay when making its recommendations.<\/p> <p> We suggest that two areas need examination.  One is the inclusion of the need for quality job creation.  That is point (e).  Under point (f), we already have employment and unemployment, rightly so.  There is a danger when we talk about the need for job creation that we are including a rhetoric that doubles up on that and might imply a trade off, which we believe is unproven assumption.  It would be more in the spirit of the Bill to refer to the need for quality job creation, which is the goal of the Bill.<\/p> <p> I will skip through my other points and turn to two last areas.  One thing we had suggested is that in terms of international comparison it might be enough to say \"international comparison\" rather than to tie us to the UK over Europe, for example.  In terms of the focus on the minimum hourly rate of pay, we now know there is a huge body of work that is saying it is not about the hourly rate of pay.  My colleagues in the Vincentian Partnership have highlighted that.  Given the precarious work, we would suggest the inclusion of \"other minimum wage instruments or measures as required\" because an hourly focus does not capture the reality of most women in Ireland, or a third of all workers.<\/p> <p> We welcome the gender balance in the commission and congratulate all of the new members.  Our final suggestion is that sociology should perhaps be included as one of the areas of expertise given that the social impact of low wages is part of the picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice-Mary Higgins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Higgins.

We warmly welcome the establishment of the low pay commission.  We are concerned about head 2.  The heading of section 11(2) refers to assisting many low-paid workers, but section 12(2) sets out seven areas to which the commission should have regard in making recommendations on the national minimum wage rate.  The terms require the commission to have regard to economic, employment and competitive issues, all of which are very important.  However, nowhere in section 12(2) are issues of adequacy of the minimum wage rate mentioned or the standard of living the national minimum wage rate enables.  Those factors are not specified for consideration.  Simply asking if the national minimum wage should be adjusted in line with changes in inflation or median earnings fails to ask the question of whether it is adequate in the first place.  It cannot be assumed that it is adequate.  We also know that the increases were made in an unsystematic manner.<\/p>  <p>  The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice has provided expenditure on the cost of a minimum essential standard of living.  This is work which meets a person's physical, psychological and social needs at a minimum level of need not wants.  We also worked with Trinity College on the establishment of a minimum income standard which helps to calculate the income required for this particular standard of living.  The data covers 89% of the working age population.  It is evidence based and is very transparent.  It enables the assessment of rates of pay regarding adequacy and the degree to which they enable a socially acceptable minimum standard of living.  The seven household compositions presented in tables 1 and 2 are representative of the most common compositions in Ireland and it is evident from the tables that all seven face a shortfall in income when reliant on the national minimum wage.  The expenditure we are talking about is very stringent and does not involve luxuries.  It just respects the dignity of the worker.  <\/p>  <p>           The minimum essential standard of living data and the minimum income standard model provide a robust and transparent method for calculating the minimum income of the household types.  Members can see that in tables 3 and 4.  The living wage method has been developed for calculating the average gross salary needed for a single adult to afford a minimum acceptable standard of living.  I was very pleased when I heard this afternoon that the Minister of State said he was going to establish a living wage forum.  It is recognised that pay rates alone cannot address the needs of low-paid households with children.  More must be done in terms of the provision of an acceptable level of services, for example, the cost of housing and the cost of accessible child care.<\/p> <p> Low pay is less than two thirds of the median hourly rate.  For example, the most recent EUROSTAT report on low wages found that the low pay threshold for Ireland was &euro;12.20 but when the matter was looked at again in 2013 it worked out at &euro;11.50.  The figure of &euro;11.50 is slightly higher than the living wage figure of &euro;11.45.  People whose income does not allow them to have an expenditure which meets the cost of a minimum essential standard of living that meets their physical and psychological needs at a minimum level are living in poverty.<\/p> <p> It is a matter of concern for many of us that people can work for 37.5 hours a week and yet come home with a wage that does not meet their family&rsquo;s minimum essential standard of living.  It is difficult to see how questions of adequacy of the national minimum wage cannot be part of the remit of the commission.  We accept that is not the only consideration.  We accept the importance of employment issues, competitiveness issues and economic issues but surely adequacy must also be taken into account.<\/p> <p> Workers are not just units of labour.  The Minister of State spoke about the dignity of work, but let us speak about the dignity of the worker.  The Vincentian Partnership is realistic.  We know that all we can do is work for a progressive realisation of a more adequate minimum wage and hopefully, eventually a living wage for everybody in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Sr. Bernadette MacMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank Sr Bernadette MacMahon.

I wish to make five points in the five minutes I have to speak.  The first point I wish to make relates very much to the comments that have been made previously, which is that head 2 is stacked too much against the worker.  We would like to see some amendments to head 2.<\/p>  <p>  We could certainly support the idea of gender equality.  We would also like to see, for example, the median wage.  It is somewhat surprising that the median wage was not included because when the national minimum wage was first introduced it was recommended and was set at more or less two thirds of the median wage.  That is quite a normal criterion against which national minimum wages are considered and set.<\/p>  <p>  I note what the Minister of State said in reply to Deputy Conaghan, but would it not be logical to have some consideration of how much the national minimum wage is compared to the living wage?  That does not sound to me to be a ridiculous thing with which to task the low pay commission.  Likewise, all human rights standards refer to a just and fair wage, exactly the type of thing Sr. Bernadette spoke about.  Why would the low pay commission not take into account human rights standards such as a just and fair wage?  The ILO convention to which Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n referred, requires states when looking at comparisons and how much the national minimum wage is worth, to also take into account the level of social protection afforded.<\/p>  <p>  It is worrying that we have set up a comparison directly with Northern Ireland when what we need to do is to recognise that is not really comparing like with like.  For example, one could take into account the cost of going to a doctor in Dublin compared to the cost of going to a doctor in Belfast.  They are very different things.  We need to make sure that the low pay commission is not constructed in such a way that it makes it difficult for people to make the arguments they want to make and that it becomes difficult for the commission to make the complete consideration we want it to make.  <\/p>  <p>         The second point relates to head 2 and the scope of the commission.  In particular, two issues need to be included in this legislation because the legislation sets out not only what the commission can consider but the order the Minister can make.  We suggest that two issues undermine the object and purpose of the national minimum wage.  One of those is the number of hours a person gets to work and the second is the amount of deductions an employer can make from that person's wage, both of which can significantly undermine the purpose of an hourly rate of the national minimum wage.  We have prepared and submitted amendments.  They might not be perfect but, hopefully, they will give some inspiration to this committee to say that even if the commission does not consider it, the Minister would be empowered out of the research he has undertaken to list in the order fair employment rules and a restriction on the amount of deductions that can be made not just relating to board and lodging but to other things such as stoppages, till shortages and uniforms.  I asked some people today how much employers are generally deducting for uniforms.  I was surprised to hear that it was &euro;200 per uniform.  That is a lot when one considers the national minimum wage.  It would be helpful if the Minister was empowered to put a ceiling not just on the amount that can be deducted for board and lodging but also for all these other things.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Esther Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Ms Lynch has one minute left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#P00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":215,"content":"<p>It is really good that the commission will hear from low-paid workers but what protection will we give them when they come forward and tell their stories?

In my experience, there is a lot that is the same as when we introduced it.  There was so much unemployment at that time that people were very vulnerable.  Where an employment right exists that people must turn up to demand, what happens is that people are too scared to do that.  A good example of that relates to deductions from wages.  The Payment of Wages Act states that the deductions from wages must be fair and reasonable but if someone is a low-paid worker who is afraid of having his or her hours cut back to almost nothing, which an employer can legally do under zero hours practices, it is very difficult for that person to have the confidence to pitch up a year later with a complaint that there has been an unreasonable deduction from his or her wages for a till shortage.  It is difficult for workers to have the confidence to come forward to stand up for their rights.  I know there has been quite a lot of comment about where all the cases are.  The reason there are so few cases is that workers are very nervous about coming forward, particularly without the involvement of a trade union.<\/p>  <p>  We know from NERA reports that non-compliance comprises more than half of some sectors and could be as high as three-quarters.  All sorts of innovations are used, such as people being asked to work for no pay, a week's trial period or the number of hours that count as work shrinking as people are sent from A to B and then to C but the time they are travelling between those places is not counted as working time.  There are all sorts of innovations coming forward as ways to undermine the value of or the obligation to pay the national minimum wage.  <\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's question, the Low Pay Commission will make a huge difference.

One thing that always worries me when I have conversations, even with friends, is that there is a lot of defensive low pay among employers.  They talk about their businesses collapsing and yet a search in this area shows that where wages have increased, companies have not gone to the wall.  My concern is that a lot of it is not just what the politicians do, it is the general public.  Do we have the will and how do we see other people?  That is a huge challenge to keep before the population.  We are talking about human beings with equal dignity.  It is a challenge to see whether we can not only change the perspective of employers but that of the general public.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n referred to what might happen if the Low Pay Commission looks only at the minimum wage.

We have done some analysis of job quality or decent work - if one wants to use that phrase - by looking at other dimensions such as working time quality, prospects, intrinsic job quality, work intensity, physical environment, etc.  It is important to note that they do not always congregate in the same jobs; some are good in one dimension and bad in another.  Looking at Europe as a whole, some 20% of the jobs in Europe are basically pretty bad on all of these dimensions.

We know it made a difference previously to the gender pay gap.  It also makes a difference in terms of towns and communities because we know that any increase in pay for those on lower pay translates immediately into spending in local services and local goods.  It has an economic knock-on effect as well as making a difference for the individual.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of whether it is entrenched, it is more than entrenched, it is evolving with new mechanisms, new systems and new tricks.  I refer to the zero hour contracts and the migration of that kind of insecure contract.  I refer to the pushing out of those kinds of contracts in sectors such as the fast food industry which in many cases has made massively increased profits during the recession.  It has not necessarily been a closing-down response, rather it is evolving.  Similarly, we know that there are cases where wages are calculated on people being able to get family income supplement as well.  There has been anecdotal evidence to the women's council of people who believe they have been punished for complaints by having their hours cut to the 15 hour minimum, which means they do not achieve the 19 hour minimum of work they need to work to access family income supplement.  There is that gap between the current 15 hour minimum and the 19 hour minimum for family income supplement and this gap is being exploited.  It is a very evolving situation and that is why we need to be ambitious in this legislation and it needs to have a really strong scope in its provisions.  If the Government wants to set out strong measures pushing for a different kind of work relationship, it needs to include that capacity and to provide those tools in the legislation. <\/p>  <p>  As well as considering compliance measures, something can be done to add stronger incentivising measures in areas such as public procurement, for example.  The National Women's Council of Ireland is of the strong view that all public spending, public procurement, grants, enterprise grants, employer incentives, should come with social clauses and social criteria attached which include not just a minimum wage but those other issues which will be highlighted in this panoply of work.  We believe that the question of the hourly rate is not sufficient in this legislation.  Even if we cannot take in every issue around low pay, precarious work or vulnerable sectors, we certainly can move beyond an hourly indicator to something that looks at the question of the number of hours and what is a secure or an insecure contract and at the question of non-fixed hour contracts, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice-Mary Higgins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Migration has been occurring over the past 15 years and low pay is pervasive, based on the evidence we have gathered in studies of the restaurant sector in recent years.

We have also conducted a survey of more than 100 workers in the care, security, restaurant and domestic work sectors.  <\/p>  <p>         It shows precarious situations such that more than 50% of those workers earn just &euro;300 a week.  They are not able to get enough hours on which to live and to earn a sustainable wage.  The minimum wage is very important to us and it has been very important to try to enforce rights for workers, to try to ensure compliance with the minimum wage.  We believe that an increase in the minimum wage will raise the standards.  As all speakers have eloquently outlined, it would make a big difference.  However, if the Bill focuses only on minimum wage issues, it will lose an opportunity.  Many migrants have become Irish citizens and they are in the labour market but discrimination at recruitment is an issue as is discrimination in the workplace.  Exploitation is still prevalent as we will show in our study when it is published in coming month.  I refer to the difficulty of workers being able to claim their rights in non-unionised sectors.  Ms Esther Lynch referred to the fear of coming forward.  People know that there is a minimum wage in Ireland and people know their rights but they have no enforcement mechanism when they are not unionised.  Fear is a big factor.<\/p> <p> The Migrant Rights Centre is continually dealing with issues of compliance and we bring cases to the Labour Court.  Compliance with the minimum wage is still a problem, in particular, for undocumented workers as our study showed.  The care work sector is very precarious.  We are doing a study with SIPTU and the Carer's Association to examine levels of compliance.  We note zero hour contracts and people fearful of complaining.  This brings in the procurement issue because companies are tendering to the health service for contracts to run our care services.  There is a package of issues in this regard.  Therefore, if the Bill deals only with the minimum wage - which I acknowledge is a significant step forward - and does not consider the inter-relationship issues and the issues that keep low pay as a pressing issue, we will lose out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Gr&aacute;inne O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Ms O'Toole referred to her concerns about the independence of the commission and that it may not survive another Government.

We still see problematic sectors that we would like to see addressed and have concerns in this regard.  We also have concerns about the way in which inspections are being conducted, particularly with regard to migrants, and we worry about ethnic profiling.  For example, we have had a number of reports in recent years of inspectors searching workplaces for the first time with immigration police and the first question they are asking workers is what is their immigration status.  This then creates an atmosphere of fear without finding out what is the exploitation.  We have raised this issue many times and it still has not been addressed.  We seek guidelines for where labour inspectors carry out inspections with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on where it is necessary and whether it is necessary.

In addition, it was noted that the income of women in couples fell by 14% during the recession versus a fall of 9% for men.  In part, that was identified as a link with the aforementioned public service work, as well as because many women are working in areas that have become highly casualised, such as retail and hospitality.

The work of child care is a separate but absolutely vital issue.  The issue of progression also is deeply affected by the question of child care.  As to how this legislation will make a difference, the very fact of examining low pay and minimum pay and in particular, if the commission looks beyond the hourly rate to weekly or monthly pay, as well as examining security of contract, security of hours and predictable hours, this will make a huge difference for women.  The very fact that so many women are on such incredibly low incomes means it will make a difference to the gender pay gap when the minimum wage is adjusted.  Moreover, adjusting conditions and providing more secure conditions also could have a huge effect.<\/p>  <p>  If I may, I also wish to address briefly Deputy Calleary's other question on small business.  It is important to state there is strong common ground potential here.  It is known that those who are on low or medium pay tend to spend in their areas with a geographical distribution one does not get when one is topping up very high salaries, for example, in the same way.  Therefore, there is a huge knock-on effect, in that this money translates directly back out into the economy and has a huge geographical distribution.  In that regard, it is an absolute win for small business.  On the issue of procurement, which a number of us have mentioned, it might be interesting to note the example of Kenya, which has reserved 30% of all of its Government contracts for businesses headed by largely local and smaller businesses that are headed by and with good conditions for women, youth and those with a disability.  This is having a huge knock-on effect of, I think, &euro;1.2 billion.  Again, this is about joined-up thinking.  It also is rewarding good practice and those employers who keep in mind that essential bargain, namely, one pays people who are giving one their work, which is their life and their time and by so doing, one is giving them the means by which they can live.  It is a basic bargain and it should be rewarded as well as enforced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice-Mary Higgins"},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":236,"content":"<p>A question was addressed to Ms Lynch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#T00600","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>There was a comment as well I think.  In response to Deputy Calleary, not all small employers are bad employers.  In fact, quite a lot of the exploitative practices about which I have been talking are not those of small employers at all but are practices of big business making big profits, which makes it all the more objectionable.  For those businesses that cannot afford the national minimum wage, provisions are in place that allow the employer to go along in private to the Labour Court.  <\/p>  <p>         It is not a publicised discussion, the accounts are not made public and such employers can tell the Labour Court they cannot afford to pay the national minimum wage for a period.  The Labour Court can then set out a lower rate of pay.  However, the legislation quite rightly limits the amount of time for that and the implicit question is, why would the legislation limit the amount of time?  Quite simply, it is that there must be fair competition.  One cannot have a situation in which one business is trying to pay the national minimum wage and to provide good, just and fair conditions of employment and is competing with somebody who has an ability to pay less.  Consequently, the legislation says one can do this for a year.  To be honest, if one cannot afford to pay the national level wage to oneself and all one's employees for a period longer than a year, one's business is struggling and needs more help than just the national minimum wage.  While a lot more should be done to help small businesses that are in trouble, I do not think it should be a subsidy from the employees' wages.  I think the Government should be helping small businesses more.  It is not a case of suggesting it is the employees' wages that should be helping because then one really is asking workers to subsidise their own employment and there is a point at which that becomes unfair, both in terms of competition and to the workers themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#T00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Esther Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.

In some cases, I could bet a week's wages on that.

As noted earlier, it is used as a justification for leaving the minimum wage as it is.  We also hear that people living on the minimum wage cannot cope because they are bad managers or because they are wasters.  Consequently, in the same way that we talked about some employers not being able to afford it, there is more than one category of employer.  The biggest point is the question of whether one can educate people because a lot of people who are relatively well-off have no idea as to what it is like to feed one's family on less than &euro;100 per week.  I refer to the food bills for four children and two adults.  Consequently, I think there is a strong educational aspect simply by asking them to face the facts.  Sometimes, people can be highly embarrassed when they are asked to apply that to themselves.  While I believe that it can be a difficult wall to get over, somehow we must come back with the facts.  This is what we try to do by saying this is what one is asking people to work for and to give 37 hours a week to doing.  It is a question of education and of appealing to them.  I do not know what the other answer is but I feel extremely strongly about it.  I have two other points to make, the first of which is about the hours and we spoke of the importance of it not just being about the hourly wage.  The second point relates to Deputy Calleary's reference to child care.  The other biggest contribution to the cost of living is housing and if one wishes to talk about child care, one should also include the cost of housing.  <\/p>  <p>         It is a difficult question that we get all the time.

I will be well within the five minutes.  My presentation will be short, but not sweet.  On the review of the general scheme of the national minimum wage, there are a few things ISME would like to bring to the attention of the committee.  <br\/><br\/>Under section 12(1) the commission states: <\/p><blockquote>[T]he Commission shall make such recommendations to the Minister that are designed to set a minimum wage that, is fair and sustainable, and when appropriate, is adjusted incrementally, and that, over time, is progressively increased.<\/blockquote>  <p>When I did my maths, the term '&quot;incremental&quot; would be positive but could be also negative.  The phrase &quot;progressively increased&quot; means that instead of having an evidence-based inquiry into the minimum wage we are already stating that this will be increased.  We would suggest that instead of having the wording I have read out, the section should state: <\/p><blockquote>The commission shall make such recommendations to the Minister that are designed to set a minimum wage that is fair and sustainable and, when appropriate, is adjusted and that, over time, is progressively adjusted without creating significant adverse consequences for employment and competitiveness.<\/blockquote>  <p>That brings us to the issue of competitiveness and productivity in the country.  Changing the wording would allow the low pay commission to make recommendations based on empirical evidence and not to be constrained by a political implication that wages will always rise.  We also feel that the deliberations of the low pay commission must be aided and supported by accurate and relevant facts and figures so as to protect businesses and the jobs therein.  <br\/><br\/>Under the functions of the commission, we see words such as &quot;productivity&quot; and &quot;national competitiveness&quot; mentioned.  As we know, figures like GDP and GNP mean different things to different people, and we need to be very careful that when we examine these issues that GDP figures are not used because we do not feel that would give an accurate measurement of the sectors that are mainly involved in the national minimum wage.  <br\/><br\/>When we talk about competitiveness, there is much disagreement about how it can be measured.  We would suggest that all deliberations within the low pay commission would be transparent and dissimilar to previous exercises like the famous benchmarking, where decisions were carried out behind closed doors, in that all of the decisions of the low pay commission would be seen in open court.  <br\/><br\/>We hope the low pay commission will take into account the knock-on effect that changes to the national minimum wage will involve.  It is imperative that the totality of the increases in the national minimum wage will be taken into account.  <\/p>  <p>         In the past relativity and differentials were used.  If there is an increase of 4%, 5% or 10% in the minimum wage, people on &euro;12, &euro;13 or &euro;14 an hour will look for similar increases.  That then ripples through the economy and definitely has to be taken into account.  <br\/><br\/>When I was here before we spoke about the fact that the real concern of workers is not the national minimum wage, which is subject to tax deductions, etc., but rather what people take home in their take home pay.  The low pay commission should concentrate on growth, the net effect and the cost to employers.  There is a tax on employment in this country, that is, employers' PRSI.  We have been always against a national minimum wage and have always looked for a low pay commission or at least a minimum incomes policy to be put in its place.  However, as this is a <i>fait accompli<\/i>, we trust that the low pay commission will be transparent and will take all relevant information into account, not just the headline figures of GDP and GNP.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Fielding","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>RGDATA represents the owners of 4,000 shops, convenience stores, forecourt stores and supermarkets around the country.  We are currently updating a 2011 economic study about the independent grocery sector which found that our members were important local employers providing 90,000 jobs in cities, towns and villages throughout the country.  I will provide copies of the updated report to the committee members once it is available.  The average hourly earnings in our members&rsquo; shops is well above the national minimum wage.  Our members provide a combination of good skilled full-time jobs including retail management, food service, butchers, bakers, chefs and retail assistants.  They also provide part-time jobs and vital first jobs in local communities throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  Excellent customer service is a cornerstone of the independent grocery sector.  Community retailers need motivated, customer focused staff that are happy in their jobs.  Part-time staff are extremely important to the grocery and convenience sector.  RGDATA members employ many people, such as parents, students and others, who want flexible part-time jobs.  Some of these may be categorised as low paid workers as they do a limited number of hours, but many want to work only mornings while their children are at school or for one day at the weekends when they are home from college.  Shop owners try to be flexible on rostering part-time staff and our members do not engage in practices such as offering zero-hour contracts.  RGDATA members believe that the one practical measure which would assist them in creating new part-time and first time jobs would be the reintroduction of the 4.25% employers&rsquo; PRSI rate.<\/p>  <p>  This committee is well aware of the considerable challenges that the retail sector has faced in recent years.  The grocery and convenience sector has faced additional challenges, including increased competition from new retail formats and a complete transformation in food shopping habits.  Independent retailers have had to cut their costs and up their game to stay in business.  They have to provide better service than the multiples, but they must remain competitive with regard to pricing.  This is a tough challenge.<\/p>  <p>  During the worst days of the past few years many independent shop owners worked 24\/7 to keep their businesses afloat and their staff in jobs, and took no salary from the business.  Many invested their pensions and their savings in the business to keep it going.  Retail sales may be showing a slight improvement in the main cities, but for many RGDATA members in rural towns and villages business conditions remain extremely challenging.  This committee needs to ensure that the Government delivers on its promise to make the tax treatment of self employed people more equitable and fair. <\/p>  <p>  The growth of the discount supermarket format has had a significant direct and negative impact on employment levels in the grocery and convenience retail sector.  This is best illustrated by a comment from an RGDATA member who said the biggest competition for her town centre supermarket which employs 90 people is coming from a Lidl outside the town which employs 15 people.  The discount grocery model is here to stay and this has significant consequences for jobs in the grocery and convenience sector.  It is a low employment format that creates very few new jobs and causes a net reduction in jobs in local shops.<\/p>  <p>  As the low pay commission is already up and running I do not have much to say about this draft legislation, except that the deliberations of the commission must be evidence based and transparent.  The retail grocery sector continues to be treated differently from the rest of the retail sector, with a retail grocery and allied trades joint labour committee.  RGDATA believes that having a sectoral agreement just for retail grocers is inappropriate and we have consistently argued that it should be scrapped.  RGDATA believes that retail grocery employers should be subject to the same employment regulations and national minimum wage conditions as other retail employers.  <\/p>  <p>         RGDATA believes that the current contribution of the independent retail sector to employment growth should be recognised and nurtured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

We have highly progressive income taxes but a highly regressive value added tax, eating into the take-home pay of those on low wages.<\/p>  <p>  We are in an era of almost negative inflation.  The most recent retail numbers at the end of January noted that by value retail sales are up by less than 1% - by volume they are up by a lot.  That is on account of very significant discounting undertaken by private sector operators.  Rather than the legislation dealing with cost of low pay etc., it would be much more important if it took into account cost-of-living issues and the drivers of those cost-of-living issues.  The legislation seems to be missing out on the Government's impact on that space.<\/p>  <p>  We are oVALbviously coming through a long global crisis that has had a major effect on this economy.  When one looks on the increase in VAT, the lack of movement on upwards-only rent reviews, the changes to sick leave legislation and how they impacted on employee expectation in that area and moves to effectively abolish the employers' rebate for redundancy, the business case for employers to create employment is increasingly challenged.  It is in this context that the observations that we already submitted in writing to the committee come to mind.<\/p>  <p>  We worry about how the evidence-based legislation will be delivered and we note that we already have a very high minimum wage in this country.  In the context of this legislation, our biggest concerns are with the knock-on impacts and the data used to derive the determination of valuation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":257,"content":"<p>As IBEC has already presented its views on the national minimum wage to the committee in the past, I will speak to the general scheme of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Head 2 amends Part 3 of National Minimum Wage Act.  Section 12(b) refers to changes in currency exchange rates during that period.  That is the period between the review by the low pay commission and the previous setting of a national minimum wage.  From the point of view of considering currency exchange rates, that is too narrow a timeframe given the potential volatility of exchange rates.  Any shock in exchange rates, could leave low value-add industries exposed relative to competitors.  We would respectfully suggest a rewording.  It would be more consistently addressed if section 12(d) were to state: \"international comparisons, particularly with Great Britain and Northern Ireland, taking into account currency exchange rates;\".<\/p>  <p>  Again with head 2 the issue of competitiveness is considered.  A number of considerations have been laid out for the low pay commission to consider, including levels of employment to unemployment, the cost of living and national competitiveness.  Given its importance in considering any adjustment to the national minimum wage, regional competitiveness should be specified there as an additional subsection.  <\/p>  <p>         Head 3 deals with the addition of Second Schedule to National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  This is section 1(4) dealing with the balance of representatives on the commission.  In defining the structure of the low pay commission, the balance of representation has been very carefully considered.  We would like to see inserted in the legislation that in the event of an absence, for whatever reason, on the low pay commission of any of the representatives provision is made to fill that immediately.  I recognise that the heads provide for doing so within six months of a vacancy arising.  Nevertheless given the timeframe between reporting which is in July and implementation, it is actually a shorter period.  Therefore in order to protect that balance we would like to see that provision strengthened.<\/p> <p> Also in that section we have a point about the chairperson of the low pay commission.  It is unclear whether the chairman would have a casting vote.  For clarity and understanding of how the commission would work, it would be important to set that out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank the members for inviting the Irish Hotels Federation to address the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the national minimum wage.  The Irish Hotels Federation, founded in 1937, is the national representative organisation of the hotel and guesthouse sector in Ireland.  We are a key stakeholder in Irish tourism and the SME sector.<br\/><br\/>Tourism is one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest industries and provides almost 205,000 jobs, equivalent to 11% of total employment in the country a figure that has grown by more than 30,000 since 2011.  It accounts for almost 4% of gross national product.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates total tourism revenue in 2014 at &euro;6.45 billion.  With more than 54,000 people directly employed by hotels and guesthouses across every county and town, the hotels sector is playing a critical role in contributing to recovery in the tourism industry and the wider economy.  The international tourism market is exceptionally competitive and every tourism euro spent in Ireland is hard won.  Value for money is an important factor in achieving growth in overall visitors as reflected in research published by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Hotels are very labour-intensive business activities operating in a very competitive international market.  In 2014 payroll costs were approximately 40% of turnover compared with 8% in manufacturing.  Because of the service nature of hotels labour productivity is low compared with other sectors in the economy. <br\/><br\/>The hotel sector provides many high-quality jobs both directly and indirectly.  These include managers, accountants, chefs, IT specialists, marketing executives and HR executives.  However, the nature of the business as a service industry is that many lower-skilled occupations are also required to provide the quality of service demanded by customers.  These include cleaners, waiting staff, accommodation staff and kitchen assistants.  In line with the hotels sector internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s hotel product requires a high proportion of the lower-skill occupations, and consequently wage costs, particularly at the lower level, are a major part of hotel competitiveness. <br\/><br\/>The reality of labour costs in the hotel sector, with payroll and related expenses amounting to approximately 40% of total revenue, is that it is affected greatly by the minimum wage.  We in the Irish Hotels Federation support a national minimum wage rate for all workers.  However, we are concerned that unjustified increases in the minimum wage will have a strong negative effect on many small and medium-sized hotels particularly outside the main urban areas. <br\/><br\/>We recommend that the national minimum wage should not be increased in the immediate future.  The domestic economy is still at a fragile stage in its recovery, particularly outside the main urban areas.  An increase at this time would jeopardise the hard-won competitiveness gains achieved in the economy and would risk excluding younger and low-skilled workers from employment.<br\/><br\/>Our comments on the heads of the national minimum wage (low pay commission) Bill are as follows.  Under the heading, National Competitiveness, the regulatory impact analysis identifies: <\/p><blockquote>The particular role of the Commission is to ensure that any advice or recommendations it makes to Government is evidence-based; utilising agreed data, carrying out research and consultations with employers, workers and their representatives and taking written and oral evidence from a wide range of organisations. <br \/><br \/>This is to ensure that any suggested changes to the National Minimum Wage have minimum adverse impact on employment and competitiveness.<\/blockquote>  <p>However, the Bill provides that in discharging the functions assigned to it by section 12(1), it is proposed that the Commission shall make such recommendations to the Minister that are designed to set a minimum wage that is fair and sustainable, and when appropriate, is adjusted incrementally, and that over time is progressively increased to assist as many low-paid workers as is reasonably practicable.  It is important that it is fair and reasonable for all parties.  <\/p>  <p>         However, it must not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.  It is not clear to us how the objectives set out in the regulatory impact assessment are to be achieved.  The Bill redefines \"minimum adverse impact\" referred to in the RIA as \"without creating significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness\".  These are entirely different objectives and we suggest an amendment should be included to rectify it.  We recommend the deletion of the word \"significant\" in section 11(2).<\/p> <p> The Bill does not identify how the commission has to ensure that its recommendations to Government are evidence-based, such as by utilising agreed data, carrying out research and consultations with employers, workers and their representatives and taking written and oral evidence from a wide range of organisations.  We recommend the insertion of a clause to stipulate this with particular reference to engagement with the sectors that are most affected.  For a national minimum wage to be fair and sustainable, it must not create a barrier to employment at entry level.  The most unfair situation that can arise is the exclusion from the workforce of those who wish to enter employment and are prevented from doing so because of uneconomic and inflexible minimum rates of pay.  We recommend the insertion of a clause that requires the commission to have regard for such an impact.<\/p> <p> In the interests of balance and fairness, any recommendations made by the Low Pay Commission should not be prejudiced by the absence of commissioners.  At all times when increases in the national minimum wage are being decided on, all commissioners must be present to vote or be provided with facilities to do so through remote access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen McNally","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to talk about low pay, the living wage and the minimum wage.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland, RAI, is happy to engage with the committee on these and other matters of mutual interest.  From the outset, we are concerned about the need to create more jobs in our industry and economy.  We will be talking about the cost of employment for businesses and it must be viewed in tandem with any discussion about the minimum wage.  If the desire of the Government and the Oireachtas is to ensure that people have more disposable income in their pockets at the end of the week, that they be able to support themselves and their families, then I suggest we look at what emanates from elsewhere in the Oireachtas.  The most direct way to increase take home pay is to reduce the excessive burden of taxation and the controversial universal social charge, USC, on employees.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of this presentation, I consulted with hundreds of restaurant owners who are members of the RAI.  The majority are small, family owned and family run businesses in every corner of Ireland.  Many of them are in a state of disbelief that there is even talk about increasing wages, when they have been struggling to keep their doors open.  Many of them will have had little or no wages paid to themselves during the past five years as they have struggled to keep their businesses alive and pay salaries to staff, pay rates to local authorities and meet the ever-increasing cost of business, including energy, insurance and, in many cases, rent.  This is not about helping create employment; it appears to be about creating an environment where it is hard to do business.<\/p>  <p>  The survey of income and living conditions produced by the CSO in 2012 shows that the level of poverty has drastically increased since 2004.  If we are to address this issue, we need to get people working.  There is no greater dignity than can be found by having a job.  It gives a reason to get up in the morning and the ability to provide for oneself and one's family.  In the past 18 months, through a pilot initiative, the RAI has taken 140 long-term unemployed people and put them through a structured chef training programme, and I am delighted to say that over 50% are now in full-time employment.  This shows that there are jobs in our industry, especially for chefs.<\/p>  <p>  An increase in the minimum wage is not the answer.  It will only stifle job creation.  As of February 2015, there are 355,124 people on the live register.  Each person who finds employment results in a saving of up to &euro;20,000 and the Government will benefit from tax revenue, employer's PRSI and USC.  The last increase in the minimum was in 2007 during the Celtic tiger era before the 2008 recession.  Youth unemployment stands at 21.6%.  That is where the problem lies.  Since the inception of the minimum wage, it has increased by 55%.  Although competitiveness has slowly returned, we are, again, losing it and now there is a proposal for an increase in the minimum wage.  Have we already forgotten what we have gone through during the past seven years?<\/p>  <p>  Considering inflation figures during the past 12 years, the minimum wage should be &euro;7.40 as opposed to &euro;8.65.  The poverty rate is highest amongst the unemployed, a shocking 19.2% compared to 1% of those employed.  When there is a rise in minimum wage, it hits small businesses, such as hospitality and restaurants, six times harder than other businesses.  <\/p>  <p>         A rise in the minimum wage will definitely deter small businesses from taking on staff.  To get a job is a starting point for employees, a foot in the door.  It provides opportunities and career progression, which in turn comes with pay rises.  Profitable businesses are giving pay increases.  However, they are doing so based on an individual&rsquo;s contribution to the business, rather than across the board pay increases.<\/p> <p> Ireland has a high minimum wage by international standards, taking into account that we have not had an increase during the recession.  Our minimum wage is the fourth highest in the EU, when Luxemburg is excluded.  In many other countries, people on lower rates of pay are taxed much more than in Ireland.  The regions in Ireland with a weaker economic performance will seriously suffer if there is an increase in the minimum wage.  We cannot allow this to happen.  It is regions like this that need help to recover.  There are still restaurants closing in small towns in Ireland.  Many restaurants and businesses are still in debt and cannot afford to have cost increases imposed on them.  Furthermore it will result in fewer jobs being created.  It will have a destabilising effect on the restaurant and hospitality industry.  The level of unemployment in the wider economy is the issue here.<\/p> <p> When the Low Pay Commission makes its final decision whether or not it will increase the minimum wage, it must conduct a detailed analysis of the cost of doing business in Ireland.  This includes the 28 regulatory and inspection bodies that the restaurant industry deals with annually, the rising cost of energy and insurance, rent reviews and the ever increasing cost of product raw material.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#BB00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Cummins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.

The only other place people can seek flexibility is wages.  <\/p>  <p>         That is a fact.  This Government committed to doing something about upward only rent reviews and did not do it.  In 2015, and allegedly on the cusp of a return to growth, we still see retail chains and retailers shutting down or going into administration or exiting.  Wages are a very big driver.  The key issue from a retail perspective is it operates in a very, very tight margin - typically 2% to 5% - therefore even a 1% increase in wages directly affects the margin of a business.  If we go back to the enabling legislation and talking about competitiveness, what is it and how are we measuring it and what are the agreements on how competitiveness will be measured - these are crucially important.  Part of the reason why these wages have softened is that this is a global competitiveness issue.  Thomas Friedman asks how does one compare a European who wants to work a 35 hour week with an Indian who wants to work a 35 hour day?

Such increases are likely to increase pressures that increase the pay of other workers in order to protect differentials.<\/blockquote>  <p>I quote this because it absolutely chimes with Ireland outside the M50 where, despite all our effort and rhetoric, it is still pretty flat.  As the Deputies go back to their constituencies this is surely chiming with them.  My colleagues talked about employers who have taken no, or very limited salaries, out of the business for the last six years - waiting for that upturn.  We are finally starting to see something of an upturn now and yet a massive instability and insecurity and dare I say it, a kick to confidence, is being created and driven by the rhetoric of Government around this matter -  &quot;Time for pay rises, time for cost increases&quot;.  At the same time the Government has mandated massive and significant costs onto employers across the board.  We have not had the reforms in our labour legislation which the UK has had as it introduces national minimum wage.  We have far more strictures here like JLCs and far less flexibility.  That is part of the reason we are challenged.  Many would argue, and I would empathise, that if there is a minimum wage, why are all these sectoral agreements needed on top of them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#EE00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1427203800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Murphy.

It is no coincidence that when the JLC was struck down that 30,000 jobs were created.  That is a direct answer to the question.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note the following.  In the hotel business the minimum level is the entry rate to the business.  We have found that it provides a level playing field for all businesses.  The point of JLCs distorts the level playing field.  That means when employees go to work on their career they have options.  When there is a level playing field it is much easier to administer as well, which is also important.<\/p>  <p>  We are delighted that tourism numbers have moved forward since the VAT rate was introduced.  The 30,000 jobs were also assisted by the move and led to a huge increase in jobs.  There are a number of issues.  In 2011, we had 5.95 million foreign visits here and in 2015, we are looking at 7.6 million visitors.  Two things happened, the VAT rate was introduced and landing charges.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday the Government set out a good policy to cover the next few years in terms of where we are going and we now have a roadmap to get 10 million visitors.  The easiest way to hijack that goal would be to get rid of the VAT rate now when, in fact, we have proved that the numbers will come into the country.  What our country needed, throughout this economic recovery, was spend from outside of Ireland.  What that created, through us becoming competitiveness, was that spend from outside of Ireland came into Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  From a satisfaction point of view, a F&aacute;ilte Ireland survey states that foreign visitors now say we are very good value and we are at the highest level than we have been for years.  I contest that the decreases in VAT have been passed on to the customer, which is important.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, there has been a lot of media speculation on how the recovery happened.  We must remember, not unlike the other industry sitting beside me, that a lot of this has happened in the urban areas, particularly Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Outside of those locations a lot of businesses are struggling.  There is no doubt that they are struggling to stay open.  At least 150 colleague hotels still remain unresolved and are financially unstable.  The majority of them are based in rural areas around the country. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important for us to note that every town and village in the country has a hotel or a guesthouse which often creates the first job for people.  Personally, my first job was at the age of 14 or 15.  It meant I was able to go into the industry and gain confidence.  I was happy to get the minimum pay rate or the rate that existed because the job was all about me getting confidence.  That is what we do, whether we are in retail, hotels or hospitality - we give people that first leg up.<\/p>  <p>  I also note that lots of students work in our industry.  Our hotels are busy at the weekends with weddings, functions, etc.  During the week students go to college but at the weekend their work in the industry finances their college years.  That is the way it works.  The industry is very much based on supply and demand and works for all parties.  It is important that we take all these points into consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#FF00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen McNally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Mr. McNally has covered a lot of the points.

Deloitte compiled one and the other two were compiled by the Department of Finance and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  All three reports reaffirmed that the pass through was given to the given to the customers with a VAT reduction since 2011.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the question on JLCs, it was the catering industry that took the challenge in 2011 and it was found to be unconstitutional.  We do not want to go back to having a system that was anti-business and anti job creation.  We are totally opposed to the re-introduction of JLCs.  Let me give the example of two pubs side by side where only one provided food.  In that case, the pub that served food had to pay a higher rate of pay because of the JLC system.  We do not want to return to that situation and believe it is a thing of the past.  We have a national minimum wage which is the base rate.  Let us negotiate from there on an individual basis with employers.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of NERA inspections, I got the report for 2014 and compared it with 2011.  The sky has not fallen down.

We were part of one as well and our concern is as follows.  During those so-called negotiations it was extremely difficult to get the group to understand that there was a big difference between a large multiple operator and a small local shop in terms of economical experience and everything else.  These small businesses had a small number of staff so when everything started going pear shaped everyone in the business knew things were really tough.  Together they might have decided that instead of somebody losing his or her job that they were all prepared to take a pay cut to try and get through the crisis.  There was inflexibility because legally they were not allowed to go below a rate that was quite in excess of the national minimum wage at the time.  The staff working in the business would have been happy for all of them to keep their jobs and continue to work with a wage that was above the minimum wage but below the joint labour committee rate.  There was also a lot of inflexibility when one tried to negotiate.  The view that came from the other side of the room was that if these businesses cannot afford to pay then they should not be in business.  The reality is that these small businesses are located in places in Ireland where no other businesses exist.  It means that if the people who work in those shops lose their jobs and the shop, hotel or restaurant closes then they will discover there is no other job available.  The people who worked in the businesses wanted to keep the businesses open and try to survive the recession.  That is where the inflexibility lay and that is where we are coming from.  We believe one should listen to all sides of the story when trying to negotiate and decide these rates.  One should listen to big and small businesses, especially for things like a minimum or starter wage rates.  Small businesses create first jobs for most people.  Therefore, small businesses should be listened to and their voices should be heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#GG00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":294,"content":"<p>In terms of data and research, I direct the Deputy to the Neumark and Wascher paper of 2007 which mentioned that a minimum wage rate will reduce employment if not set at a moderate rate.  The OECD wrote the same in 1998, the World Bank did so in 2006 and there is also an IMF study from 2014 which indicated this fact.  The IMF study made the point that youth employment in particular, which now is at the extraordinary level of 21%, will increase in the context of a minimum wage increase.<\/p>  <p>  We should be aware of another issue.  I attended the launch of the Government's tourism plan for the period 2015 to 2025 in Kilkenny yesterday where the Minister and the Taoiseach talked about our need to focus on cost.  Do we honestly think that an increase in the minimum wage will not have a knock-on impact on everything ranging from hairdressing to child care?  The latter issue of child care is one of the big issues that affects Irish society at present.  Of course an increase will have an impact.  We live in an era where the European Central Bank has embarked on a massive amount of quantitative easing to drive inflation because there is no inflation.  <\/p>  <p>         If anything, there is deflation when the cost of the decrease in the price of oil is taken into account.

We all accept that the recovery is very unbalanced throughout the country.  Some parts of the country, such as the city of Dublin, are doing particularly well.  The western region and other parts of the country are experiencing significant difficulties.  It is very difficult to argue against an increase for employees who are working in sectors that are doing particularly well.  Hotels and restaurants in Dublin and perhaps in other parts of the country are significantly increasing their prices.  I am aware that some hotels have increased the cost of accommodation by up to 15% in recent times.  The increase may be somewhat more in some cases.  The same thing applies to restaurants.  How can the witnesses argue that the employees working in those establishments should not see an increase in their wages as a result of the improvement in business that those establishments are seeing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015032400002#HH00300","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427203800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>The Senator is right to say that business has improved in Dublin in particular.  It is important to note that there is almost a shortage of bedrooms in the centre of Dublin at the moment.  People will agree with that as well.  We have come from such a deep position since we went to the base that the increase taking place as part of the recovery seems high.  The recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report made it clear that Dublin is the fourth most occupied city in Europe, but it is merely the 14th most expensive city in terms of the rate we are charging.  It is clear that we still have a long way to go to get ourselves up.  Practically speaking, the rates in London are twice the rates in Dublin.  That is what one would find if one compared the two cities, but we are not even going there.  I can give the Senator very good examples of hotels right across Dublin that have already increased pay rates.  That has happened in the cases of hotels that have been able to afford to do so.  The Senator made the important point that Dublin is almost running differently from everywhere else.  When a busy market is overheating, our employees will move somewhere else if we do not mind them.  The market will determine the way it is going to move.  Maybe that is what is happening in Dublin.  The market is flat outside Dublin.  Many hotels are just opening again.  The seasonal hotels will be opening at the start of April for Easter.  Their numbers are looking okay, but some of them have not been refurbished for some time.  Their restaurants might not have seen a new piece of furniture for eight years, or their bedrooms might not have seen a new carpet for nine years.  These businesses are trying to get up to an economic level again.  That is the balance we have here.  I have seen the increases that have been put in place in Dublin - it has happened in our company - because the economics have said it is absolutely right that the employees should be rewarded.  That did not require a joint labour committee or a minimum rate.  The market demand said we had to do something.

It is required in professions where particular skills need to be reserved.  I will give two examples that come to mind.  In the first example, one is running a pharmacy and is therefore obliged to have a qualified pharmacist on site.  An issue might arise that means one has to ensure somebody is reserved for some hours to cover a potential upcoming absence - perhaps a pharmacist is on call for a family emergency.  One might not necessarily have a vacancy at the time, but one needs to ensure someone is available.  One could use a zero-hour contract appropriately in such circumstances by calling on an individual if he or she is needed to fill in.<\/p>  <p>  The second example I would like to give relates to manufacturing.  A manufacturing company might sometimes reserve hours with a skilled technician, such as a welder, in case it wins a particular contract.  It might not know whether that contract is coming in, but in order to achieve that contract it needs to be able to demonstrate that it has the skill set at its disposal to fulfil the contract.  In such circumstances, it might decide to reserve the hours on a zero-hour contract.

As I said earlier, employees are not interested in gross pay; they are interested in take-home pay.  The distribution of wealth is the job of the Government rather than the job of employers.  If the market dictates that the going rate for a certain job is &euro;10 an hour, for example, a person will be contracted or employed at that rate.  The national average wage is approximately &euro;32,000 at the moment.  If a person could earn up to approximately two-thirds of that wage, or approximately &euro;21,000, without being taxed or being hit with PRSI and USC, that would distribute the burden that is coming through the tax system.  The employer pays the going rate for the job.  The Government decides that people need to have a certain amount.  We suggest that they should not be taxed up to a certain level.  They should be allowed to earn up to &euro;21,000, for example, without being taxed.  The pressure or burden should not be placed solely on the employer.  That is really the thing.  It comes through.  We are saying the tax and social welfare systems should take up the difference between what the going rate for the job is - the employer's objective is to get people at the going rate - and what the Government determines to be a living wage or whatever we hear being thrown around at the moment.

I believe this is important and timely legislation that deserves support.<\/p> <p>  I am a lecturer in strategic marketing and management in the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT.  My PhD from the University of Stirling is on the impact of alcohol marketing on young people.  In my opening statement I wish to address a number of fundamental principles that legislators should bear in mind when considering the marketing components contained in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Marketing is more than just advertising.  There is a tendency for non-marketers to focus almost exclusively on advertising as if it was entirely synonymous with marketing.  In reality advertising is just one part of what is known as the marketing mix.  At its most basic level, marketers refer to the 4 Ps of marketing: product, price, place and promotion.  Each of these four Ps can be manipulated by marketers to bring about a change in sales and brand positioning.  Advertising is one part of the fourth P, promotion, along with sponsorship, sales promotions, direct marketing, personal selling and public relations.  In turn, advertising can be further subdivided according to the communications channel used, television, newspapers, outdoor, online, etc.  Marketing is considerably broader and more complex than the single issue of advertising.  The different elements of the marketing mix are closely integrated.  The many different elements of an effective marketing plan are not considered in isolation but are designed in an integrated and mutually reinforcing manner. <\/p> <p>  Marketing is changing as technology offers new communications channels.  The days when television advertising was the dominant communications channel are long over, especially when it comes to alcohol marketing.  For example, in 2010 Diageo announced that 21% of its marketing budget would be diverted to online marketing.  Other alcohol companies and brands have followed a similar strategy.  There are a number of reasons for this.  In the first instance, it allows for more effective targeting of consumers, especially via social media.  For this reason, some brands have shifted most of their online marketing budget away from traditional websites and towards social media.  Second, its interactive nature makes it arguably more effective than traditional passive advertising methods.  It is worth noting that digital marketing operates largely below the radar of policy-makers because they do not form part of the target audience.  This means that there may be many digital marketing initiatives that regulators and policy-makers are completely unaware of, making it significantly harder to regulate.<\/p> <p>  Marketing and advertising are not a form of corporate philanthropy.  Marketing exists to drive sales.  It may have other objectives related to brand positioning, but these sub-objectives are a means to an end, not an end in itself.  The ultimate aim is greater market share, revenue and profit.  These increases in market share and sales revenue can come about through attracting customers away from competitors, recruiting entirely new consumers or encouraging existing consumers to buy more of the product.<\/p> <p>  Marketing works.  It is not hard to find those who argue that marketing does not work because they think they themselves are not influenced by it.  In reality we are all influenced by marketing to a greater or lesser extent.  Often it is those who are younger who tend to be most influenced by marketing, perhaps because they have not formed individual consumption habits or because marketing, and the media more broadly, is used as a guide to fitting in.  Globally, tens of billions of euro are spent every year on marketing.  These data-driven marketing campaigns are carefully researched, designed and executed, and they work.<\/p> <p>  In particular, alcohol marketing works.  There really is no longer any debate on this matter.  Some may argue alcohol marketing works merely by stealing market share from competitors.  This is partly correct but it is only one way in which marketing works.  We now have a range of longitudinal studies from different countries that have followed young people over time, tracking their exposure to marketing and their subsequent alcohol consumption.  Longitudinal studies are important because they can establish causal relationships.  These studies clearly indicate that the more alcohol marketing young people are exposed to, the more likely they are to start drinking and the more likely they are to drink if they are already drinkers.  From a scientific perspective, there is no longer any serious debate about whether alcohol marketing drives consumption.<\/p> <p>  Young people are especially susceptible to the influence of marketing.  More needs to be done to protect children from the influence of marketing in general.  This is an important children&rsquo;s rights issue.  Specific steps that can be taken in the alcohol field include lowering the advertising audience profile threshold for under 18s to less than 10%, implementing the proposed ban on outdoor alcohol advertising, and initiating a ban on the sponsorship of sport by alcohol brands.  These last two, outdoor advertising and sports sponsorship, are especially important because they are indiscriminate in nature and, in the absence of a ban, it is not easy to protect minors from exposure to marketing.<\/p> <p>  Commercial sponsorship is not a form of charitable giving.  It is a carefully designed and well resourced commercial activity aimed at brand positioning and increasing sales.  To give some idea of the commercial significance of sponsorship, in 2013 approximately $60 billion was spent on traditional product advertising in the United States, while $20 billion was spent on sports sponsorship across all product types.  Sponsorship is serious business.  Sponsorship works by appropriating the image of the sport or team and applying it to the brand in question.  It is arguable that sponsorship is even more effective than traditional passive television advertising precisely because of the strong emotional link fans have with their sport or team.  The influence of sponsorship may also be compounded by the exposure to branded merchandise that accompanies many sponsorship deals.<\/p> <p>  On a related note, there is much media comment at the moment about responsible drinking campaigns sponsored by the alcohol industry.  These marketing campaigns are part of the political and public relations background against which the debate on this Bill is taking place and as such are worthy of comment.  It is, of course, possible to interpret these initiatives as a genuine attempt to tackle Ireland&rsquo;s problematic drinking culture.  It is also, however, possible to come to a different interpretation.  It is worth remembering that the tobacco industry adopted a defensive and reactive stance when it first came under public scrutiny some decades ago.  It is now tightly regulated.  The alcohol industry may have learned from the experience of tobacco regulation.  It has adopted a more proactive stance, especially whenever new statutory regulations are on the horizon.  The worthwhile central copy clearance system was proposed by the industry in 2003 at a time when alcohol advertising was coming under heavier scrutiny.  In 2005, the co-regulatory codes agreed between the then Department of Health and Children and the alcohol and advertising industries were agreed on the eve of legislation being published to control alcohol marketing.  As a result of this initiative, the planned legislation was shelved.  Now a new high-profile campaign has been launched concurrently with the publication of the public health (alcohol) Bill.  Perhaps the timing of all of these initiatives is coincidental but an alternative explanation is also possible, namely, that they are timed and designed to placate policy-makers and to brand the alcohol industry as responsible stakeholders who should not be too tightly regulated.<\/p> <p>  If alcohol companies wish to promote a safe drinking campaign, they could do so more credibly by opting not to have seats on the board of the social aspect organisations they fund and by not having corporate logos associated with these campaigns.  Failing to take these steps naturally invites one to assume that it is a clever exercise in corporate branding.<\/p><p>The alcohol industry might also wish to explain how it can simultaneously maintain that tens of millions of euro spent in promoting alcohol does not lead to increased drinking but that one or two million euro spent in promoting safe drinking will lead to less drinking.  It seems hard to reconcile two such contradictory positions.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention and look forward to answering questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Kenny and call on Mr. Barry Dooley to give evidence on behalf of the Association of Advertisers in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#C00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427211000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I am pleased to accept the joint committee's invitation on behalf of the Association of Advertisers in Ireland, AAI, to contribute to its discussion on the general scheme of the public health (alcohol) Bill 2015.  The AAI's submission, dated 4 March, and our opening statement which members have to hand only address Part 3 of the Bill, namely, head 9 on page 17, which pertains to the control of marketing and advertising of alcohol products.  I am conscious that my presentation should be limited to five minutes and keen to elaborate at some stage during the open discussion on factual information on the Deloitte research findings and Central Copy Clearance Ireland, CCCI, trading as CopyClear.  The AAI is a members' organisation, with its members being companies that advertise.  There are 43 companies in the membership and their advertising expenditure during 2014 represented in excess of 20% of the overall advertising spend last year.  The AAI is the only association focused single-mindedly on the Interests of Irish advertisers.  Its role is to promote and defend the reasonable freedom to advertise and, consequently, our area of expertise is advertising.  Companies join the AAI because they recognise the need to be a responsible advertiser.  AAI members understand the freedom to advertise responsibly is a crucial element of a healthy economy.  By informing, educating and enriching our society, advertising adds to quality of life.  A vocal minority disputes this view and governments and regulators increasingly are put under pressure to impose restrictions that are both unjustified and disproportionate.<\/p> <p>  I will summarise briefly our specific recommendations and observations to the committee, to be followed by our overall executive summary of the main points.  As for the summary of recommendations to the committee, the AAI, first, seeks clarification on the finer details of the Bill to be in a better position to assess its overall implications and comment accordingly.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of subhead (3) of head 9, on page 17 of the Bill, we wish to highlight our recommendations and observations in response to the proposed regulations as detailed under subhead (3), namely, subhead (3)(a), subhead (3)(c), subhead (3)(d) and subhead (3)(f).  As for subhead (3)(a), legislation imposing watersheds will result in a loss to Irish broadcast stations only and ignores the reality that many children watch television after 9 p.m.  There are five Irish television stations that are likely to be affected and we query the effectiveness of this measure-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Dooley"},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I apologise, but I ask members and delegates, if they have not switched off their mobile phones, to please ensure they are switched off because they are interfering with the broadcasting of proceedings.

These restrictions could also have a very serious impact on the outdoor media and creative sector.  <\/p> <p>  As for subhead (3)(d), once again, restrictions within the print sector inevitably will result in a negative impact.  We ask the question as to what such a proposal is likely to achieve.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of subhead (3)(f), Ireland has among the strictest and most comprehensive set of codes in the world governing the content and placement of advertising.<\/p> <p>  I turn to the overall executive summary of the main points.  The AAI believes we need policies and codes that strengthen the advertising sector for brands, media, agencies and services.  We believe the freedom to advertise within a clear and responsible framework is good for people, business and the economy.  We are potentially concerned that plans to impose further restrictions could be counter-productive.  We believe a wide stakeholder response to alcohol misuse is what is required rather than a random selection of measures.  That said, we support measures that are fairly assessed, can be effectively monitored and will have a positive impact but not measures for the sake of them.  I ask members, when considering new measures or restrictions, to think about what they are likely to achieve and whether they will make a difference.  We believe everyone should play his or her part.  The industry must act accordingly; Governments must legislate fairly and consumers must behave responsibly.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the AAI, I again thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee and hope what I have submitted and said thus far will be of use to it in its work.  Advertising supports more than 30,000 jobs and is a sector that is an important driver of business activity.  I will be happy to respond to queries or requests for further clarification of the role of the AAI that members may require.  I would welcome the opportunity to brief the committee on the Deloitte research findings on the advertising industry and CopyClear, or the CCCI, of which the committee must be conscious when considering the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Dooley"},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dooley.

I am accompanied by Mr. Jerome White who provides executive support for the Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland, RRAI, and is no relation of mine.  <\/p> <p>  The code of practice on the display of alcohol in mixed trading premises, effectively, supermarkets and convenience stores, was established in 2009 as an alternative to section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 which provided for the structural separation of alcohol products from other retail items in mixed trading premises.  The case the retailers made at the time was that the cost of physical separation and the ensuing operational costs were prohibitively expensive and that the measure would be impractical to implement.  Effectively, we are supporting head 15 of the Bill and the commitments included in the explanatory notes on that head.<\/p> <p>  The RRAI code and its implementation structure have been agreed with the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health and are quite significant.  I will summarise them briefly.  <\/p> <p>  First, the code recognises that alcohol is not an ordinary product and should be displayed and promoted differently from other beverages and food products.  It provides that alcohol products should be displayed in one part of the premises and, as far as possible, separate from food.  It provides that the advertising of alcohol products within supermarkets should be confined to the alcohol selling area and not aimed at minors, and that it should not glamorise alcohol or seek to encourage excessive consumption.  It further provides that advertising in newspapers and magazines by supermarkets should not have more than 25% of the space devoted to alcohol products, that an annual independent audit of compliance with the code should be carried out and that the RRAI should operate a customer complaints mechanism.  It also stipulates that the board of the RRAI should appoint an independent chairperson who will submit an annual compliance report to the Minister for Justice and Equality and that the Minister can then decide if the degree of compliance identified in the annual compliance report warrants continuation of the code of practice.  <\/p> <p>  I was appointed as the independent chairperson of the RRAI in 2009 in consultation with the then Minister.  I am independent in the sense that I have no background whatever in the alcohol industry or the trade sector.  To date, I have submitted six annual compliance reports to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The last published annual compliance report was for the year ending September 2011.  The most recent three reports for the years ending September 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively, have not yet been published by the Minister.<\/p> <p>  Our membership represents the overwhelming majority of supermarkets in the Republic of Ireland, with more than 2,600 stores operating the code of practice.  The RRAI has continued to increase its membership.  Since the start of 2013, the following retailers have joined: Applegreen; Checkout; Daybreak; Fresh XL;Joyce Group, Galway; JC Savage, Swords; Morton&rsquo;s, Dublin and Donnybrook Fair, Dublin.  Significantly, this total includes more than 1,000 wine-only stores which would not be bound by the structural separation provisions of section 9 of the 2008 Act, were they to be implemented, but which are severely bound by me and the code of practice.  This is a significant additional benefit of the code.  While there are no precise alcohol share numbers publically available, based on the most recent Kantar Worldpanel measure of the Irish grocery market, we estimate that RRAI members have at least a 95% share of the Irish grocery market which could be taken as indicative of their alcohol share of the mixed trade sector.<\/p> <p>  As for the degree of compliance, since 2009 those stores operating within the remit of the RRAI have demonstrated a high overall level of compliance with the requirements of the voluntary code.<\/p><p>The overall compliance rates with the agreed criteria have averaged 86.6%, with multiple groups, that is, the larger groups, attaining 93.8% and the convenience stores averaging 80%.  We also operate a sanctions policy which is clearly set out in our website,<i>rrai.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>I wish to say a little about head 15.  As I said, we support the provisions of head 15.  The RRAI was engaged in discussions with the previous Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and his officials and we fully support these proposals.  We have consistently supported the replacement of the existing voluntary code of practice in supermarkets with a statutory code with strengthened provisions on the display and sale of alcohol in mixed trade stores under section 17 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.<br\/><br\/>The heads of the Bill, in the explanatory note, provide for a two-year trial period of the statutory code after which there would be an evaluation by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department Health of its effectiveness prior to any decision to implement section 9.  We support the two-year trial period as an appropriate timeframe to determine the effectiveness of the statutory code.  Assuming that there is a trial period, throughout that period we will continue to implement and monitor compliance of RRAI members.  I add that we have the option of bringing to the notice of the Garda and the courts examples of noteworthy breaches of the code by non-members.  We have done that and I have been directly involved in it.  One of the main concerns we have is that, after all the lengthy deliberations on the matter and the Cabinet approval of head 15 of the Bill on 3 February 2015, there would be a reduction, modification or elimination of the proposed two-year trial period and its associated provisions.<br\/><br\/>The stand-alone off-licence sector<b><i><\/i><\/b>is not a member of the RRAI.  We have consistently urged the Department of Health to introduce, as recommended in the substance misuse report, an appropriate code for the stand-alone off-licence sector and that it, too, be put on a statutory footing.  They are not bound by any code relating to the display and advertising of their alcohol products.  It is a matter of regret and puzzlement to me that the Department of Health have given no indication of addressing the need for a code in the stand-alone off-licence sector.<br\/><br\/>Since the code was introduced on the RRAI in 2009, it has delivered a demonstrable change in how alcohol products are displayed and sold in supermarkets.  Gone are the days when displays of alcohol were at two, three, or four different places in a supermarket.  Now they are in one location.  There is no alcohol in the windows of the supermarkets.  Our independent audit indicates a very high degree of compliance on those physical aspects of the display and merchandising of alcohol.  These outcomes have been achieved in a transparent manner by means of independent verification at no cost to the State.  We are ready to support the statutory code and the evaluation of its effectiveness after a two-year trial period and we look to the committee to support effectively what is in the Bill and the explanatory note.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic White","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. White and call Mr. James Doorley from the National Youth Council of Ireland to make his remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#D00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427211000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for the invitation.  We welcome the opportunity to meet the committee to outline our views on the draft heads of the public health (alcohol) Bill 2015.<br\/><br\/>The National Youth Council of Ireland is the representative body for 47 national youth organisations working with young people in every community in Ireland.  We represent the interests of our member organisations and use our collective experience to act on issues that impact on young people.  I will not go through lots of statistics on children and young people's consumption of alcohol because it is in our submission.  The committee has received our data.  I have no doubt that, as politicians active at local level, members of the committee are aware that we have a problem in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>As outlined in our submission, since about 2000, we have participated on a number of statutory groups and committees.  We are concerned that children and young people are beginning to start drinking at a younger age, are drinking greater volumes of alcohol, and are drinking more frequently with all the associated negative consequences.  We are also concerned about the impact of alcohol related harm on children and young people in households where alcohol misuse is a problem.<br\/><br\/>The nature and means by which alcohol is promoted, sold and consumed has changed radically in the past 20 years.  When alcohol is widely available in supermarkets and convenience stores, is sold at cheap and pocket money prices with sophisticated and pervasive advertising and marketing, we should not be at all surprised by our current consumption patterns and subsequent problems.  Public policy has not kept pace with these changes.  It is not a lack of research, analysis or recommendation on what works and what needs to be done that has stopped us.  As noted by a 2009 Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance report, there were eight committees and 13 reports between 1990 and 2009, and we have had a few more since then.  We have lots of reports and lots of recommendations.  That is why we welcome this legislation because it is a step in the right direction.  For the first time a Government is implementing evidence-informed legislative actions to address the problem.<br\/><br\/>While we welcome the Bill overall and as a member of the national substance misuse strategy steering group, we are disappointed that a number of recommendations, such as the recommendation to phase out the sponsorship of sport by the drinks industry, have been sidelined.  That is a missed opportunity.  We are also disappointed that the recommendation supported by us to have a social responsibility levy on the industry is not included in the measures.<br\/><br\/>Regarding head 5 on labelling, we welcome the proposal to enhance the current labelling requirements of alcohol products but it is important that this information should be presented in a concise, conspicuous and understandable way.  In particular we welcome the proposal to include calorie content information on alcohol products because we believe many young people, indeed consumers of all ages, are not aware of the calories in each drink.<br\/><br\/>We strongly support the introduction of minimum pricing because international evidence indicates that this is an effective means by which to reduce alcohol consumption among children and young people.  Children and young people under 18 are price sensitive and therefore this measure will ensure they will purchase and consume less alcohol and drink less frequently.  We note in our submission that the minimum price at which this should be set should be at a level that is effective and must be reviewed regularly.  I will not go into much detail on this because I understand the committee has had international expertise from the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group.<br\/><br\/>In relation to advertising and marketing, we have outlined in our submission the really strong evidence about the impact and role of advertising and marketing on young people's attitude to drinking and their drinking behaviour.  This is not just our view.  The first report of the alcohol marketing communications monitoring body, whose members include representatives of the drinks and advertising industry, quoted a WHO report which stated &quot;exposure to and enjoyment of alcohol advertising predicts heavier drinking and more frequent drinking among young people&quot;.  The public favours action in this area.  A Eurobarometer report from 2010 found that 81% of the public was in favour of banning alcohol advertising targeting young people.  As has been said, children and young people are particularly drawn to music, characters, humour and stories, and if one watches the advertisements on TV they have all these elements.  The report links alcohol and drinking with fun, success, popularity and excitement without any of the negative effects.  In 2009, we conducted a study, entitled &quot;Get 'em Young&quot;, which tracked young people's exposure to alcohol advertising and marketing.  While I admit that it is a number years out of date, it did show at that time that young people were exposed to a high level of marketing and advertising through 16 different communications channels.  Our 2009 report found that television was the most dominant channel of exposure to alcohol advertising recorded by young people.  It would have changed a bit since then.  I would imagine that the online element has increased quite a lot.<br\/><br\/>The national substance misuse strategy steering group recommended a 9 p.m. watershed for alcohol advertising on television, and we are disappointed this is not in the legislation.  At present, the only restrictions on drinks advertising are between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. and where more than 25% of the audience is under 18 years.  I do not know if that many people are watching breakfast TV and watching drinks advertising but it is not on at those times.  At present if there is a match on, for example, a GAA or rugby match, which obviously many people have been watching over recent weeks, and there are 1 million people watching it, if fewer than 250,000 of those people are under 18, it is fine to have alcohol advertising.  If 240,000 children and young people are watching it, that is fine.  That is permissible under the current codes.  We are out of line with many EU countries in this regard.<br\/><br\/>We are also disappointed the draft legislation ignores the recommendations of the national substance misuse strategy steering group to prohibit outdoor advertising.<\/p><p>The current voluntary codes were agreed with by the drinks industry with the advertisers and, in our view, are designed to be ineffective and, in many cases, unworkable.  One provision in the code suggested there should be no alcohol advertising within 100 m of the entrance to a school.  A list was to be drawn up by the Department of Health but it was never drawn up because it is impossible to define the entrance to a school.  Is it the door or the gate?  Even if we agreed it was the gate, we are saying that it is okay to have alcohol advertising within 101 m of a school.  It is bizarre and unworkable.<\/p><p> We also are opposed to suggestions the current flawed codes are enshrined in law.  We need to develop new codes with youth, public health and other interests involved in the process because the ban on outdoor advertising is the only workable and effective solution.  We support the proposal to commence section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 and a move towards structured separation of alcohol products from ordinary products in mixed trading premises such as petrol stations, supermarkets and convenience stores.  There has been a major increase in the availability of alcohol to young people.  There has been a fivefold increase in the number of off-licences, including exclusive off-licences and mixed trading premises, and the introduction of statutory structural separation will reduce the availability and perception that the sale of alcohol is just another ordinary product.  While the current voluntary code has led to some improvements in the large supermarkets, the situation in convenience stores and petrol stations has not improved.  The provisions in the voluntary code allowing for structural separation in as far as possible is a get-out clause for many mixed trading premises.  Application of section 9 is very clear and will require physical structural separation.  Where retailers cannot currently comply, they have a year following commencement of the section to adapt their premises.  We urge the committee and the Government to move forward on structural separation because the availability of alcohol and the perception that it is an ordinary product in the mixed trading premises is creating a problem.

As the Joint Committee on Health and Children, we are charged with scrutiny of legislation such as the public health (alcohol) Bill.  For maybe too long, we have been discussing the harm done to our people by alcohol abuse and excessive drinking.  It is an issue that is endemic in our culture and we must address in the best way possible policies, legislation and other mechanisms to discourage people from excessive drinking and to encourage safe drinking.  The broader issue of advertising is interesting.  No business will spend money on advertising unless it is successful.  Mr. Dooley refers to it being 3% of the overall advertising budget in the country but the multiples are also advertising alcohol in their advertising campaigns.  They spend 8%, one quarter of which is alcohol-related if we take the amount permissible under various codes.  It is a substantial sum of money.<\/p> <p>  Do we accept alcohol is causing damage to citizens and society?  We heard empirical evidence presented to the committee over many years about the dangers of alcohol consumption to the health of the population and last week's evidence was damning about the profile of people presenting with cirrhosis of the liver.  It is an alarming development and seems to be because of excessive alcohol consumption among younger people and the trend towards more women drinking.  The evidence for that is the fallout in hospitals and on Saturday nights.  The key question is how to bring forward policies and support or enact legislation that diminishes the consumption of alcohol in the population.  To date, we have failed to do so.<\/p> <p>  The issue of off-licences has been raised by Mr. Doorley.  Every Deputy and Senator knows that when off-licences pop-up, almost immediately we have problems with anti-social behaviour and other problems from the fallout of excessive drinking in the immediate environs of off-licences.  There are off-licences that are responsible and carry out detailed checking of customers' age but the bottom line is that people can legally walk into an off-licence at 18 years and buy industrial volumes of alcohol.  This happening day in and day out in our country.  That permeates into the peer group of the purchaser, whose friends can be 15 or 16 years.  Large volumes of alcohol are available to under age people from legal purchase.  We must be conscious of this.<\/p> <p>  This brings us back to why so many young people are participating in binge drinking on a regular basis.  There is a cultural aspect to this that has been here for a long time but alcohol advertising has a role in it.  There is no doubt the target audience is not a 74-year-old man drinking two points of Murphy's or Beamish in a pub in Cork.  The younger audience is the target for advertising companies and the drinks industry, something we must be conscious of.  Does anyone support us lifting the ban on tobacco advertising?  Do we think we should be allowed to advertise tobacco freely without inhibition or legislative blocks?  I do not think anyone would propose this as we all know tobacco is bad for people and we should do everything in public health policy to try to discourage people from taking up smoking.  The same applies to alcohol.  That is our responsibility.<\/p> <p>  Diageo came out with Senator Jillian van Turnhout's least favourite campaign and it suggests there is a reaction by some drinks companies to the fact that we are, incrementally but continuously, moving in a direction to try to clamp down and discourage binge drinking and the broader consumption of alcohol in society.  I am also concerned that it sends the wrong signals that, somehow, these companies are doing it for society's good as opposed to trying to ward off the inevitable move to addressing the advertising of alcohol and the targeting of young people.<\/p> <p>  With regard to off-licences, Mr. White says single off-licences are not included in the code of practice and they seem to be problematic.  Statistics and evidence show that it is a major problem.  Is there any way of bringing them into the code?  What is possible?  There seems to be broad compliance with the code by large multiples.  While they are separating the drink element from groceries and the rest of retail, it is a prevalent and obvious place to purchase alcohol, which is being done in industrial volumes in some cases.<\/p> <p>  What I find strange about alcohol advertising in sport is that we never saw Sonia O'Sullivan advertising a pint being good to gee her up for a 1500 m race.  We never see sports people saying that the reason they are great hurlers is that they drink four or five pints or five or six half pints.<\/p><p>We all know that elite sportspeople and athletes are very much opposed to alcohol consumption, yet we piggyback on every sports occasion to drive home the promotion of alcohol consumption to younger people.  It is a fundamental flaw - I am not making a political point about the Government - that we have not bitten the bullet in accepting that sports advertising is targeting an audience, normally a younger one, when it comes to drink promotion.  That is something we have to accept and deal with.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Doorley's organisation represents a huge number of youth organisations throughout the country.  Is the National Youth Council of Ireland <i>ad idem<\/i>on the full banning of alcohol advertising at sports events?  If so, is it drawing these conclusions from the evidence it has looked at in terms of the impact it has on members?  Will Mr. Doorley share that information with us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#E00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their very informative presentations and apologise on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who cannot be here.  <\/p> <p>  Our relationship with and abuse of alcohol is the cause of most social problems in the country.  The impacts on our health and health services are detrimental.  The reality is that young Irish adults drink more than any other segment of the population and it is they who are most open to marketing, be it through sports event or socialising.  It is no coincidence, therefore, that there is a link.<\/p> <p>  The banning of outdoor advertising of alcohol is possibly the only workable solution, as in the absence of a ban, it is not easy to protect minors.  I refer to the point on banning outdoor advertising within 100 m of a school.  The Department of Health was to draw up a list, but I do not know if it was ever done.  Such a ban might be hard to implement, but banning adverts within 100 m of the school gate would be better than having them located straight across the road.  In my constituency there is an off licence just across the main road from a national school.  I am sure it would be better if it was not allowed to be located there.<\/p> <p>  It has been mentioned that between 1990 and 2006 there was a fivefold increase in the number of off licences.  Were there increases during the recession or has the number decreased?  Is there any evidence that the increase in the numbers of Aldi and Lidl outlets, offering cheaper alcohol, has led to an increase in alcohol consumption among young people?<\/p> <p>  The presentation made by Dr. Patrick Kenny was very good as he completely broke down what advertising was about.  The part to which I am attracted is social media marketing which is not even on our radar.  It seeks to attract younger people and we may not even realise it is being done, but it is harder to regulate.  It is something of which we need to take particular note.  <\/p> <p>  I also took an interest in the last point made by Dr. Kenny and I am wondering if anybody else has a comment to make on it.  He stated the alcohol industry might wish to explain how it could simultaneously maintain that the tens of millions of euro spent in promoting alcohol would not lead to increased drinking but that the one or two million euro spent in promoting safe drinking would lead to less drinking.  He said it was hard to reconcile two such contradictory positions.  I agree and wonder if anyone else has an opinion on the matter.<\/p> <p>  In its presentation the Association of Advertisers in Ireland states Ireland has the strictest and most comprehensive set of codes in the world governing the placement of the advertising of alcohol and sponsorship.  That is great, but how come we still have a huge issue with alcohol abuse and under-age drinking if that is the case?  The codes might be the strictest, but they are obviously not working.   <\/p> <p>  Under-age drinking is an issue I have raised on a number of occasions.  Anybody can walk into an off licence at the age of 18 years and buy whatever amount of drink  he or she wants.  It was put to me at some point - I think this is a great idea - that the age limit to buy alcohol in an off licence should be raised to 21 years, while the age at which people could buy drink in pubs would be left at 18.  The reasoning behind this is we have a huge problem with bush drinking.  People in the age group of 21 to 23 years are less likely to supply drink for 15, 16 and 17 year olds than an 18 year old because of the age gap.  Do the delegates have an opinion on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#F00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  As I studied marketing in college, when Dr. Kenny began his presentation, it felt a little like I was back all those years ago.  I found his presentation fascinating.  When I was preparing a report on alcohol-related harm, I read about a strategy, I think, in California which asked the drinks industry to fund a public health campaign.  The industry had to provide equivalent funding for the public health campaign in order that advertisements would be of a similar colour, style etc., or else there would be a ban on advertising.  The industry very quickly stated it needed to withdraw from advertising.  This is an indication of how much money was being put into advertising and influencing.<\/p> <p>  I was surprised to read the statement by the AAI that we had the most comprehensive and strictest codes in the world.  I would like to know what the evidence for this is because it is certainly not my experience.  I do not have all of my files with, but I was surprised to read that statement.  Because of the nature of my work with the Children's Rights Alliance and as a Senator, I have had the privilege of meeting many children's groups and very often will ask them what is their favourite advertisement.  I can give a guarantee that alcohol advertisements will be in the top three.  Whether it is intentional, the reality is that the message is getting through to children and this is an issue that should concern us as members of the health committee.  <\/p> <p>  We have heard contradictory statements from the NYCI and the AAI on the 9 p.m. watershed.  The AAI advises us of the loss of revenue to Irish television and radio stations, while the NYCI states that if we do not have one, we will be out of line with many other EU countries.  Are we actually talking about the United Kingdom and is it the case that we have to engage with it?  I would like to drill down into that matter a little more.  <\/p> <p>  The NYCI raised an interesting issue about outdoor advertising, including at successive bus stops.  While the code has positive elements, there are ways industry has found to push this aspect.  <\/p> <p>  What is the NYCI's view on the role of education and information provision?  It is something on which we are being lobbied.  We are hearing that if we were to provide more information on alcohol-related harm, we could change the out-of-control drinking culture among young people.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Doorley mentioned the social responsibility levy.  Will he advise us on how it would work and whether he has put proposals to the Department of Finance?<\/p><p> Prior to referring to point No. 7, Dr. Kenny mentioned online activity, which is a source of concern for me and others.  When I look at YouTube clips I see one set of ads, but when my nephews who are in their late teens view such clips, they are more likely to see advertisements by the drinks industry, which proves that there is targeted marketing.  Therefore, online marketing is an issue.<\/p><p> In point No. 7 Dr. Kenny mentions outdoor advertisements and sports sponsorship.  It is a children's rights issue in that we should protect children from the influence of marketing.  I concur with my colleagues and question why we have not set a date to put a ban in place.  <\/p><p> A question was asked as to how youth work organisations viewed sports sponsorship.  I have experience of being a volunteer in a youth work organisation and under our codes we could not take money from the drinks industry, yet we have been told that sports sponsorship is different.  Youth work organisations have a tremendous reach across Ireland.  We should, therefore, adopt a consistent approach when considering the needs of young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#F00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I call Senator Colm Burke who shall be followed by Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#G00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I refer to a paragraph in the presentation made by Mr. White on codes of practice.

What is the code in such circumstances?<\/p><p>I wish to raise the issue of young people drinking with the NYCI.  It is acknowledged that it is a major problem.  Interestingly, research carried out for the Young Scientist Exhibition this year showed that there was a huge connection between the attitude to alcohol of parents and that of students.  How much of a difference would it make if we we were to stop all alcohol advertisements and sponsorship by drinks companiesd in the morning?  In view of the research findings, how much of a difference does the NYCI think such an initiative would make?  I am at a disadvantage as I have not seen the full presentation on the research findings.  Clearly, they indicate that children are hugely influenced by the attitudes of their parents to alcohol.  In the past ten or 15 years there has been a huge increase in the number of off-licence premises and a corresponding increase in the volume of alcohol consumed.  From the experience of the NYCI, what difference would such legislation make?  About what timescale is it talking?<\/p><p>In recent years it appears that people start are starting to drink at a younger age.

I probably speak for every person sitting in this side of the room when I say we are going to do everything we can to protect public health.  Professor Frank Murray and other professors have told us that every day three people die as a result of the overconsumption of alcohol.  Every night between 1,500 and 1,800 bed are taken up by patients as a result of alcohol abuse.  Every week here we talk about the plight of patients on trolleys as there are no beds available in hospitals.  We could solve this problem by tackling the issue of alcohol abuse.  I found it disingenuous when the AAI stated, \"We will fight their corner with regulators and politicians...\"  Let us remember that politicians do their best to protect public health.  <\/p> <p>  When Professor Aiden McCormick attended the committee, he sought to have a levy imposed on alcohol advertising and &euro;60 million spent on research.  What is the reaction of the AAI reaction to his suggestion?  An enormous amount money is spent in promoting drink.  With their expertise, will the delegates tell us how we, as politicians in speaking out to promote the health of the nation, should convey the message that people should not over-consume alcohol?<\/p> <p>  Women are dying from breast cancer.  There is a belief that if one consumes alcohol, breast cancer will probably recur.  Alcohol has also been implicated in cases of suicides and dealing with other issues in society.  Therefore, I find it hard to believe that AAI can promote drink.  There are pubs in my constituency, not just off-licences, that sell drink cheaply.  At the weekend one such pub sold a glass of gin for &euro;3 and still could afford to advertise.  I shall not name it to prevent its identity from being splashed all over the newspapers tomorrow, giving it free advertising, but when one looks at newspapers one will see that one can buy a bottle of vodka for between &euro;15 and &euro;20.  I recall that one could not buy that amount of alcohol for the same price 20 years ago.  Every newspaper has full page advertisements for alcohol, at the bottom of which are listed all of the special offers, which is not good.  I know that the organisation has defended advertising, but we want to defend health policy.  I ask the organisation to help us in getting the message across to curb the use of alcohol.

Online marketing avails of web 1.0, while social media avails of web 2.0 where there is an extra layer of engagement.<\/p><p>The latest research shows that the higher the level of a person's engagement with marketing, the more effective the marketing activity will be.  Social media are a unique environment in which one has simultaneous engagement with brands and peers.  What we also find in the online and social media environment is that peers are actively recruited by companies - alcohol marketers in this case - as brand ambassadors.  I would go as far as to say peers have become perpetuators and magnifiers of marketing.  If members do not have the relevant applications on their smartphones, they can download some this evening and view what can be done with them.  Geo-tagging allows users to find the nearest bars or off-licences or play games in which one interacts with the alcohol brand in a much more intensive manner than is the case with traditional television advertising.  They can also communicate with peers on social media via branded communication, which means the communication will be sent from an individual branded with the name of the alcohol brand.  This facility makes this type of marketing much more effective.<\/p><p> Members may ask what can be done about this issue.  I draw their attention to the case of Finland where legislation has been introduced to restrict aspects of social media and online marketing.  For example, it has outlawed games which are a highly effective means of getting people to engage with marketing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>When were these measures introduced in Finland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#H00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427211000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>The legislation was introduced earlier this year.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of websites, we need to consider what happened with tobacco websites in the United States some years ago.  Here there are no effective age restrictions on access to alcohol websites.  I have visited some websites which state users must be aged over 18 years.  However, browsers are even offered a date of birth that is exactly 18 years prior to the date of their visit to the site.  This means, for example, that a browser visiting the site today, 24 March 2015, would automatically be given a date of birth of 24 March 1997, which would allow him or her to click to proceed.  Users do not even have to be able to substract 18 years from the current year.  Irish alcohol websites could certainly be required to operate an effective age verification system.  This could be done through credit card referencing or one of the specialist companies that provide this service. <\/p> <p>  On the strictness or otherwise of advertising codes, while I welcome the copy clearance system which was introduced approximately 12 years, it is not perfect as I believe advertisements that are in breach of the code continue to be approved.  Research that shows that marketing influences consumption is not predicated on these advertisements breaching regulatory codes.  I presume, therefore, that all of these advertisements are approved under the codes, yet they still have an impact on consumption.<\/p> <p>  The lack of strictness lies in the area of audience thresholds of 25%.  For me, the key age group we need to consider is those who are ready to experiment with alcohol.  The average age of initiation with alcohol is 15 years.  If we take a cohort encompassing several years before and after the average, let us say the population of children aged between 11 and 17 years, we find that, according to the most recent census, this age group accounts for approximately 9.8% of the population.  As such, any threshold figure that is above 10% potentially allows for a disproportionate targeting of teenagers who are in the zone where they are ready to experiment with alcohol. <\/p> <p>  We are sometimes told there is no evidence that sponsorship affects consumption.  I query that view.  While it is certainly true that there is much more evidence that examines advertising on its own, research that studies only one form of marketing is somewhat deficient because one cannot control all of the other types of marketing to which a person has been exposed.  Recent studies examine the effects of cumulative exposure to multiple channels of marketing, numbering 12, 15 and sometimes more.  These studies show that the larger the number of channels of marketing, including sponsorship, to which young people are exposed, the more powerful the impact of marketing on consumption. <\/p> <p>  Sponsorship is similar to social media because it allows for a high level of engagement, much more so than passive traditional advertising.  It is often argued that a ban on sports sponsorship would lead to a shortfall in funding.  While this possibility is certainly worth considering, it is noteworthy that minimum pricing would increase revenue.  Given that this additional revenue must be directed somewhere, perhaps some of it might be ring-fenced to make up for any shortfall in funding for sports that would arise from a ban.  It is also worth remembering that other companies will step in to sponsor sports bodies. <\/p> <p>  On the question of how to get across the message about not drinking to excess, we must examine the impact of marketing on social norms.  There is absolute consensus in the literature that our perception of what is socially acceptable and common are two of the biggest drivers of behaviour in many areas of life, in particular, alcohol.  One of my arguments is that the fact that alcohol is so widely promoted and the industry sponsors sport tells us something culturally about the acceptability and normality, as it were, of alcohol consumption.  I am not anti-alcohol - it can play an important part in social life - but when one is communicating to people, especially young people who are involved in sport, a message that it is okay for sport to be endorsed by alcohol companies, one is doing something to the culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Kenny reject the claim made by the sports bodies that they could not afford to continue without some sponsorship and that alcohol companies are the only companies with sufficient money to fund such sponsorship?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#H00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427211000,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Two issues arise in this regard.

To answer Deputy Billy Kelleher's question on whether I agree that Ireland has a problem with young people binge drinking, of course, I agree with him.  There is a problem with alcohol abuse and I would not try to shirk from that issue in any way.  The role of the Association of Advertisers in Ireland, AAI, is to promote and defend the reasonable freedom to advertise responsibly.  We have the strictest advertising code in the world and adhere to the Advertising Authority for Ireland's advertising code, as all advertisers must.  I do not propose to go through all five of the relevant pages of the code, but I can submit copies to the committee after the meeting.  The key section dealing with advertising to children reads:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>Marketing communications should not be directed at children or in any way encourage them to start drinking. Accordingly: <br \/><br \/>(a) Anyone depicted in an alcohol marketing communication should be aged over 25 and should appear to be over 25...<\/blockquote>This means that the people who appear in beer advertisements, that is, the people about whom young people may or may not comment, are aged over 25 years and also appear to be aged over 25 years.  I make this point because it is important that it be acknowledged. <br\/><br\/>That brings me to CopyClear.  Members will have received handouts of an annual report from CopyClear.  This reinforces the point that Ireland is one of the markets with the strictest advertising codes in the world.  CopyClear was established 12 years ago and exists nowhere else but in New Zealand.  Funded by the alcohol companies, it is independently run by the Association of Advertisers in Ireland, which I represent, and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland, IAPE.  It has four full-time copy clearance managers who work twice weekly to assess and approve all advertising copy.  They make their assessments based on the code of the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland.  It is very important that members are conscious of this because many people are not aware of CopyClear's existence.  Proof that the body has been operating successfully for the past 12 years lies in the fact that in 2013 and thus far in 2014 the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland has not upheld a single advertising complaint.<br\/><br\/>Anecdotally, members may hear that children love an advertisement for Heineken, Guinness or an another product.

We would sit in at an appeals meeting, listen to the issues and comment or approve accordingly.  In many cases advertisements made in Europe for pan-European usage and appearing in other markets are not approved for use in Ireland.  In most cases those advertisements have to be adapted to suit our code, which is the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland code.  The ASAI code is being updated this year and alcohol is one of the sections that needs to be updated.  We will do our level best to ensure it is gold standard in its rules and sections and is updated accordingly.<\/p> <p>  We are here to promote and defend the reasonable freedom to advertise.  We are doing our level best to behave that way.  I agree there are some who do not do so because there is always one bad apple, but we try to stop that as best we can.  We ask the Government for its support to help us continue to develop those standards as opposed to imposing restrictions.<\/p> <p>  On the question of what is different about the alcohol market, I am not trying to be smart when I say it is no different from other markets in industry in that it never was nor will be any different because the brands within the alcohol sector are competing for market share.  As Dr. Kenny said, the norm is that the market in which they operate is static or in decline, so for some of these brands to grow, they need to win new customers at the expense of other brands.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Billy Kelleher referred to the multiples, which include SuperValu, Dunnes, Tesco, Spar, Aldi and Lidl.  They are supermarkets which spent &euro;68 million last year in comparison with the beer and alcohol brands which spent &euro;26 million.  It is significantly larger and I take on board the Deputy's comments about alcohol appearing in some of those advertisements.  Aldi and Lidl, for example, are German discounters which have captured 15% of the market.  We are all aware of that because the data are published every three months by Kantar and everyone is discussing it.  It is said that SuperValu will overtake Tesco.  The dynamics within the supermarket sector are no different from the alcohol sector.  Without being smart, I suggest the committee looks at tea, at Lyons and Barry's, which are two pillar brands in Ireland which have nothing to do with alcohol but the dynamics within which market are exactly the same.  Barry's Tea has a loyal customer base-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Dooley"},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":357,"content":"<p>It does not damage one's health or kill people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#J00800","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427211000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I am talking about the dynamics in the advertising market and the behaviour of brands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Dooley"},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":359,"content":"<p>We are talking about health policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#J01000","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427211000,"counter":360,"content":"<p>The point I am trying to make is that they are competing for market share as opposed to trying to get more people to drink more of their product.

Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor mentioned the Association of Advertisers in Ireland, AAI, doing our best to represent the advertisers.  That is my role as the chief executive officer of the AAI - to promote and defend the reasonable freedom to advertise.  The industry commissioned a large-scale research study into the impact of advertising in the economy.  I draw the Deputy's attention to key facts from the report.  The findings are based on rigorous and complex analysis conducted by Deloitte, which involved building an econometric model across 18 countries and 15 years of data to isolate the role of advertising.  The report contains very important facts such as the &euro;938 million spent on advertising in 2012 which resulted in a &euro;5.3 billion return to the economy.  Advertising supports 30,000 jobs, 38% of all revenue to Irish media comes from advertising, and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#J01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Dooley"},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I read the report.

We support a strengthened statutory code, a two-year trial period and objective assessment.  The key requirement from our point of view is the two-year trial period for an enhanced statutory code for the supermarket sector.  At the end of that two-year period the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality would evaluate whether the supermarkets have been effective in implementing the code.  If they deem it is unacceptable, it is up to them if they want to implement section 9 of the Bill.  It is important to understand why I am here and why this structure has been created.  The only reason the responsible retailing of alcohol structure, the code company and the independent chairperson were created was as an alternative to section 9.<\/p><p>What does section 9 tate?  It states that if one has a full off-licence with wines and spirits, one has to have a wall, separate turnstile or gate, and have a till and staffed checkout located in the alcohol area.  The supermarkets said at the time to the then Minister, Dermot Ahern, that it would cost a fortune and that they could deliver more through a code, which would include advertising within the store and external advertising among other measures.  The view is that there has been substantial delivery to the public by means of the code, a public complaints mechanism and us taking action against non-compliant members and others.  It follows logically that if section 9 were implemented tomorrow or if the provisions in the heads of the Bill were changed, the RRAI would disappear overnight in effect because the rationale for its continuation would be completely gone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#J02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic White","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>There would be, however, stand-alone operations within existing premises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#K00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427211000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>That is correct.

In response to Deputy Billy Kelleher&rsquo;s question on the stand-alone off-licence sector, there was a clear recommendation in the substance misuse report that the Department of Health should develop an appropriate code for it.  It is defined as a premises that sells alcohol plus such items as ice cream and sweets.  Clearly, the same code would not apply as applies in a full-range supermarket.  One of the things that really provokes and annoys the normal supermarkets is that they could be in the same street and they are barred from having any alcohol in the window or any advertising, yet two doors down the road one could have a stand-alone off-licence with windows full of alcohol and advertising.  It is a puzzle to me.  I strongly ask the committee to press for a statutory code for the stand-alone off-licence sector.  It has no code whatsoever but, interestingly, its members are the ones who complain most often about the code we have.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Colm Burke, where the statutory code would be strengthened would be in the mandatory separation of alcohol from food and beverages.  It would not be as far as possible; it would be mandatory.  That is critical.  Strengthening the statutory code would ensure mandatory separation of food and beverages for all stores, bar the small specialist food shops.

The last point was an issue we discussed at the national substance misuse strategy group because we have seen a huge explosion in the off-licence area.  We had a discussion about restricting or reducing the number of off-licences.  Deputy Billy Kelleher mentioned that off-licences can spring up and suddenly issues arise.<\/p> <p>  I was a little surprised that the process for getting a licence seems to be quite simple.  One has to apply to the courts first and then go to the Revenue.  Everyone pays the same price for a licence.  A large multiple selling millions of euro worth of alcohol pays the same price as a small corner shop.  I do not think that makes any sense.<\/p> <p>  The other point related to the sponsorship of sporting bodies by the drinks industry.<\/p><p>I am a big sports fan and a member of the GAA.  The sports organisations do brilliant work with young people.  However, that work is undermined by the organisations insisting on it being supported by companies the product of which may cause young people a lot of damage.  Deputy Billy Kelleher made an interesting point that most elite athletes, including professional rugby and soccer players and inter-county GAA players, were not allowed to drink alcohol because it would impair their performance.  There is an irony in that regard.  We were very much of the view that alcohol advertising in sport should be phased out over time and ultimately banned.  I have asked sports organisations how much they receive from drinks companies, but that information has not been made available.  If we knew how much was involved, we might then look at replacing it in some way.<\/p><p> On marketing and advertising, Dr. Kenny has noted that the WHO, the independent science committees at EU level and so on are all very clear that advertising and marketing have a clear role to play in patterns of alcohol consumption.  Our view is that the only solution in terms of outdoor advertising is a ban, as Deputy Sandra McLellan mentioned.  I do not agree that the current code is strict.  In the case of bus stops, for example, one is not permitted to have alcohol advertisements all over a particular shelter, but there is no overall restriction.  In my daily commute I pass 15 or so bus shelters, all of which might carry an advertisement for alcohol.  There is no restriction on the overall volume of outdoor advertising; the restriction applies only to an individual bus shelter or bus.  The code essentially was a case of the drinks industry and advertisers getting together, writing the examination questions and scoring themselves on the result.  That is my view of it.<\/p><p> We are very supportive of the minimum pricing proposals because they would put a floor to the price of alcohol.  Young people have always experimented with drink, but the issue now is the types and quantities of alcohol they are drinking and the frequency of their partaking in same.  Behaviour in this regard is very different from what one would have seen 20 or 30 years ago when young people found it very hard to access alcohol because it was only available in a pub or an off-licence.  In fact, many rural areas did not even have an off-licence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#K01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Doorley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>What can we do to change those behaviours?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#L00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427211000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Price is a major factor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Doorley"},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>If Mr. Doorley could have a wish list of actions to be implemented, what would it include other than price?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#L00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427211000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>As well as minimum pricing, we would like to see better regulation of advertising, particularly outdoor advertising, which is included in the Bill.

Young people who use Facebook and other social media sites are being invited by some drinks companies to design their own alcopop bottle, share their design with friends and perhaps win a prize.  That type of activity creates an atmosphere in which alcohol is fun and exciting.  Senator Jillian van Turnhout mentioned television advertising.  In our study in 2009 young people were asked for their favourite advertisements.  I was not surprised that alcohol advertisements were so well represented.  It is not surprising, given that the companies concerned spend millions on them.  They are excellent examples of marketing, but they are driving young people to drink in greater quantities, more frequently and at a younger age.  The whole purpose of these advertisements is to create an association between alcohol and fun, sport, popularity and success and we should not be surprised when young people respond to them.<\/p> <p>  On the role of education and information, 15 years ago or so our organisation was very strong in arguing for their efficacy.  However, all of the international evidence suggests that without action on price and other issues, information and education will have a very limited impact.  There is no reason we cannot invest in educational strategies, but it is not an even contest when we, for example, expose young people to a course over six weeks on the dangers of alcohol while, at the same time, drink is marketed everywhere, easily available and cheap.  In that environment education and information will not work.<\/p> <p>  On the introduction a social responsibility levy, we made that proposal to the national substance misuse strategy steering group as an alternative to the drinks industry being involved directly in campaigns.  In a context in which the industry had at the time a turnover of some &euro;25 billion, we suggested a very small levy could bring in &euro;25 million to &euro;30 million per annum.  That money could then be hypothecated by the Government for information campaigns or assigned to sports bodies.  We have put the same proposal to the Department of Finance in our last two or three pre-budget submissions.  It is really along the lines of the polluter pays principle, the polluter in this case being an industry that is causing damage in our society.  It would be a very small contribution in the context of the costs I mentioned, but it would be something.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke mentioned the attitudes of young people and how we might influence them.  What they learn from parents and family certainly has a role to play, but there is probably very limited action the Government can take in this regard.  What it can do is take steps to redress the balance.  Our view is that the balance has swung too far in terms of price, availability and marketing promotion.  We are not anti-alcohol, but we are saying the balance is not right and that we are seeing the negative consequences of this.  The Government must seek to rebalance matters in order to protect children, younger people in particular.<\/p> <p>  On the question of a levy on alcohol advertising, we would prefer to see more restrictions and a ban on certain advertising rather than a levy.<\/p> <p>  Our view is that we have had the recommendations, the group has been set up and the research conducted.  We do not agree with those who say we need more consultation and dialogue and that we can change things by working for a change of culture around drinking.  We would not have reduced the incidence of dangerous driving by having a discussion about the culture of dangerous driving.  We would not have brought forward the smoking ban in having a discussion on the culture of smoking in pubs.  These changes were achieved by the Government in taking legislative action to introduce measures that were evidence-based, not just nationally but internationally, and they have been proved to have had an effect.  That is why, although we would like to see it strengthened in certain aspects, in overall terms, we welcome this legislation very strongly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Doorley"},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Doorley.

This issue was discussed by the committee in July 2014.<\/p> <p>  I am interim national director of human resources in the HSE.  I took office on 1 December 2014 and have been with the HSE for a period of six to nine months.  I am joined by my colleague Ms Lawler who is deputy national director of human resources.<\/p> <p>  Members will be aware that the internal audit report contains 22  recommendations which deal, in the main, with issues of compliance with approved public sector remuneration levels for senior management in agencies funded under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  A report detailing progress in the implementation of the 22 recommendations has been made available for members.  Some 13 of the recommendations were dealt with through the development and implementation of an overall health sector pay policy which was issued in September 2013 to the statutory and voluntary health sector by way of Department of Health Circular 11\/2013.  The circular reflects Government policy on senior public service pay.  The policy makes it clear that bodies funded under section 38 of the Health Act 2004 may not supplement approved rates of remuneration, either with Exchequer or non-Exchequer funding.<\/p> <p>  A total of 17 recommendations have been implemented in full; a further three are still in progress - Nos. 10, 20 and 21; while it has not been possible to implement two of them, Nos. 14 and 19, owing to information gained or decisions made since the audit was completed.<\/p><p> Recommendation No. 9 is still in progress and is awaiting decision from the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform as it relates to decisions in respect of applications to red circle remuneration arrangements on a personal to post holder basis owing to legal contractual entitlements.  These applications have been made under section 7(4) of the pay policy and have been made by the agencies after they obtained independent legal advice to ensure action taken by the agency as an employer is done in a legally compliant manner.  This mitigates the risk of future legal action to the greatest extent possible.<\/p><p> Where support has been given for cases it is on the very strict understanding that once the current post holder no longer holds that post, the non-compliant red-circled remuneration shall cease.  In addition, when the post holder vacates the position, all future appointees will be remunerated in line with the Department of Health consolidated payscales and the practice of paying the particular non-compliant remuneration will therefore cease.<\/p><p> If I may, I will correct something from the report.  On recommendation No. 9, the report refers to 85 individually named employees.  My apologies.  That should read 85 cases.  A total of 85 cases have now been submitted for consideration from 25 agencies.  We are disappointed that one agency has declined to engage fully with the process and this is being dealt with through the management arrangements described in the service arrangements between the Health Service Executive and that agency.<\/p><p> Recommendations Nos. 20 and 21, which are also reported as in progress, relate to a sizing exercise undertaken to determine appropriate pay rates for chief executives of section 38 agencies, which was undertaken by the Department of Health in conjunction with the HSE.  This resulted in a proposal on the recommended sizing which has been submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and we await its decision.<\/p><p> Recommendations Nos. 14 and 19 are reported as not implementable as these relate to access to the public pension scheme and the recoupment of payments under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act.  We have information and decisions from the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform that it is not possible to recoup the payments under FEMPI.  As far as the issue of the public sector pension scheme is concerned, the requirement is that employees have access to a pension scheme, not necessarily the public pension scheme.<\/p><p> Members will be aware that since the findings of the internal audit report was accepted by the HSE board at its meeting in July 2013 and subsequently implemented as reported to this committee, this has been challenging for a number of parties.  We should not underestimate the impact of public and media attention on senior executives in the public service and the complexity of the legal contractual relationships this has brought under scrutiny.  It is important to hold focus that this process was started to ensure public funding is directed appropriately to patient care.<\/p><p> The HSE has implemented enhanced governance arrangements in 2013 through the development and implementation of an annual compliance statement process as part of the requirements of the service arrangements between the HSE and the section 38 organisations.  This, together with the twice yearly meetings between the HSE and the chairs of section 38 agencies, will ensure a better working relationship between funder and provider in maintaining compliance with Government policy.  The HSE is committed to building on this process to ensure continuous improvement of effective governance arrangements with the sector in line with legislative and good practice requirements.<\/p><p> That concludes my opening statement and, together with my colleague, I will endeavour to answer questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032400002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Tegerdine","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427211000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Before calling Deputy Billy Kelleher, I want to ask Mr. Tegerdine one question.
