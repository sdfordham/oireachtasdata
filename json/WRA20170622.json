In parallel to this, a Strategic Environmental Assessment was also carried out. As part of this assessment, an environmental report was drafted, the purpose of which was to evaluate the likely environmental effects of implementation and non-implementation of the draft Forestry Programme. This included an evaluation of realistic strategic alternative approaches and options, as well as suggested mitigation and enhancement measures to prevent, reduce and offset any significant adverse effects on the environment arising from the implementation of the draft programme. Mitigating measures adopted by the Forestry Programme are listed under Section 6.12 of the programme document itself. All documents are publicly available on the Department's website. <\/p>  <p>  As regards any potential effect of afforestation on land prices, it should be noted that there are many factors which can influence land prices. Some are macro factors such as supply and demand and some are more local. Other factors include the prevailing economic climate, for example, the price of land decreasing as a result of the financial crisis of 2008\/2009. There are also regional variations in terms of demand, supply and quality which influence the final price paid for land.  To claim that afforestation grants and premium rates are responsible for driving up the price of all land types across the entire country overlooks the complexity that exists within the land market. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the economic aspects of forestry, I firmly believe that the sector is good for our economy and in particular, good for our people living in rural communities. Forestry generates economic activity in rural areas where other sectors of our economy cannot reach. It helps create sustainable and vibrant communities by supporting jobs throughout the forest cycle including planting, fencing, thinning, forest roading, harvesting and transportation, and replanting, and of course through the related nursery and processing sectors. In addition, numerous jobs are supported indirectly throughout rural communities, from machinery sales to local shops. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200054#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coillte Teoranta","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200054#WRA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[27973\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200054#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when he last met with Coillte; if he will report on the discussions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>My most recent meeting with Coillte was on 10 April 2017 in Macroom, Co.

From the forestry perspective of land use, the Paris Agreement includes a strong recognition of the role of forests in mitigating climate change.<\/p>  <p>  This aligns with the Government&rsquo;s long-term ambition for the sector- an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. In effect, carbon-neutral agriculture aspires to balancing agricultural emissions with carbon-sequestration, reducing emissions from land sector, increasing fossil fuel displacement and materials displacement.<\/p>  <p>  With this in mind, we are correct to seek to maintain one of Europe's most sustainable forms of food production - the Irish family farm.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department and its agencies have been strongly focussed on improving the efficiency of Irish farming which is fundamental to reducing emissions.\u00a0 We are focused on improving animal, grassland and nutrient management and have invested heavily in a number of schemes and measures such as the Origin Green initiative, the\u00a0Beef Data and Genomics Programme and our Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS.\u00a0 Our knowledge transfer programmes are key to bringing the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers. <\/p>  <p>  These strategies have led to a significant decoupling of production output and emissions, with current analysis suggesting that the emissions intensity per kcal of food output in 2013 had reduced by approximately 14% relative to 2005. <\/p>  <p>  FoodWise 2025 includes clear and comprehensive commitments to managing the projected growth in the Irish agri-food sector in a sustainable way.\u00a0 The guiding principle underpinning this projected growth is that environmental protection and economic competitiveness will be considered as equal and complementary, one will not be achieved at the expense of the other.<\/p>  <p>  FoodWise provides a framework for the agri sector to engage with the National Mitigation Plan and for the development of a common vision of transition to a low carbon future. <\/p>  <p>  There is also a strong commitment to measuring and monitoring the sustainability credentials of the sector. As part of the implementation phase of FoodWise, an Environmental Sustainability Committee has been established. This implementation process will include evaluation and assessment of the delivery of sustainability and mitigation actions.<\/p>  <p>  All of these efforts are being implemented alongside an extensive afforestation scheme. Afforestation is the main cost effective land based climate mitigation tool available to Ireland, followed by the above mentioned technologies in agriculture itself. Climate change mitigation by forests, forest fuels and wood products is one of the principal drivers of the policy to expand forest cover out to mid century. Agriculture and afforestation are intrinsically linked in Ireland, with every new hectare of afforestation comes directly from agriculture.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to actively engage in the whole of government approach on climate policy to examine the best means of encouraging sustainable intensification of food production, while optimising the sectors contribution to greenhouse gas mitigation and sequestration including through afforestation and other forest sector activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200054#WRA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200054#WRA02450"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[28150\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200054#WRA02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the review of the areas of natural constraint; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":38,"content":"<p>Under the Rural Development Regulation each Member State\u00a0must designate areas eligible for payments under the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme.\u00a0 The ANC scheme replaces the previous Disadvantaged Areas Scheme \/ Less Favoured Areas Scheme.\u00a0 The designation of eligible areas under these schemes to date has been based on a range of socio-economic factors.

The Scheme, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with SBCI, makes &euro;150 million available to farmers at interest rates of 2.95%. Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and allows them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises. The SBCI reported that &euro;60.2m has been drawn down by farmers to the end of April. The average loan size is &euro;32,000, with more than half the loans being advanced for terms of four years or more.\u00a0SBCI report that some 8% of the loans to date have been drawn down by the tillage sector which is\u00a0in line with borrowing levels for the sector as a proportion of total agricultural borrowings. The banks advise that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down. I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector. I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future. Implementation of this Scheme is subject to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408\/2013 (de minimis aid in the agricultural production sector). Support provided under the de minimis regulation complies with State Aid rules in the agriculture sector and does not require prior approval by the EU Commission.<\/p><p>Under this regulation,\u00a0I introduced the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II which\u00a0opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017.

In 2015 and 2016 the total area planted was 12,793 hectares which is slightly higher than the target set.

The national target is to increase total forest cover to 18% by 2050. <\/p>  <p>  My Department actively promotes afforestation as a land use that can work in support of the existing agricultural activity. For example it is an option for farmers who wish to diversify their income stream or\u00a0increase profitability while maintaining their agricultural output.\u00a0\u00a0Forestry does not necessarily mean a reduction in agricultural output nor does it mean converting the entire farm to forestry. Instead where land is underutilised, it signals a more efficient use of land bringing the entire farm closer to its productive potential. Most importantly this approach introduces a stable and additional income into the farm. This new income stream can be used to develop the farm business as part of the overall plan for the farm. It also of course has multiplier effects for the rural economy and currently supports over 12,000 jobs across the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The current forestry programme introduced changes to the afforestation scheme aimed at increasing planting levels. These changes included the creation of a single premium rate for farmers and non farmers to encourage non farmers to plant. New forest schemes such as agroforestry and forestry for fibre were introduced to allow farmers to plant trees while continuing to have animals graze the land that they had planted. Forestry for fibre also allows farmers to plant trees with much shorter rotations than traditional forestry.

This was\u00a0due to a combination of factors including increased global supply, the effects of the Russian ban on the import of EU agri-food products and reduced global demand, notably for dairy products in China.<\/p>  <p>  During that phase of volatility, the EU Commission, both prompted and supported by Ireland, among other Member States,\u00a0responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures. Among the main elements of these packages have been the extension and broadening of more &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; support measures such as intervention and aids to private storage, as well as more flexible, targeted, direct aid allocated to Member States to spend in accordance with their national circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland welcomed and used many of the options provided in the various packages. These include the private storage of cheese, the buying of skimmed milk powder (SMP) into intervention, the payment of direct aid of &euro;26.4 million to dairy  producers. Also the advance payment of annual direct payments to all farmers was a welcome provision of cash flow for farmers at a difficult time. In addition, a\u00a0Milk Production Reduction Scheme,\u00a0allowed almost\u00a0 44,000 farmers across the EU (circa 4,000 from Ireland) agreed voluntarily to reduce their milk production, represented significant market stabilising efforts.<\/p>  <p>  Global supply and demand dynamics evolved more favourably as 2016 progressed with a\u00a0better \u00a0market environment emerging as a consequence.\u00a0In spite of these signals of market recovery, the situation remains uncertain in particular product sectors, such as SMP.

This means that all applicants, apart from public bodies, are eligible for the same annual premium payment. Up to this point European Council Regulation 1698\/2005 on support for rural development had set a higher rate for farmers than for non-farmers. This distinction did not appear in the replacement to this regulation which exists under the current Common Agriculture Policy. <\/p>  <p>  The single premium rate does not diminish in any way the financial benefits that farmers can enjoy if they decide to plant trees. In fact a recent Teagasc study showed that on marginal land switching from some cattle systems to forestry can yield a net gain as high as &euro;228 per hectare for each year of the forest rotation.\u00a0 \u00a0The net return from changing from a sheep system to forestry is largely similar. This analysis is based on current afforestation grant and premium rates and on Farm Family Income reported in Teagasc&rsquo;s 2015 National Farm Survey. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the single premium rate was designed to make the afforestation scheme more accessible to landowners who were not farming the land themselves; this would include sons and daughters of farmers or other relatives who might have inherited land but who have careers outside of farming. This approach\u00a0also includes institutional investors such as pension funds, although in these cases having to purchase land first makes forestry a less attractive investment. My Department continues to view the single premium approach as an important strategy in increasing forest cover in Ireland. Our aim in this regard is to achieve forest cover of 18% by 2050. Consequently there are no plans to revert back to an afforestation scheme which offers higher premiums to farmers than to non-farmers and our focus now is working to achieve the targets set out in the Forestry Programme up to 2020. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200055#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agrifood Sector","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200055#WRB01950"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[28824\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200055#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he has spoken to his Northern Irish counterpart regarding the negative impact of a hard border on the agrifood sector in particular.","asker":"1283","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>I and my officials began engaging with our UK counterparts, including in Northern Ireland,\u00a0shortly after the Referendum result was announced in June 2016.

These sectors are of critical importance to our economy given their regional spread and the fact that they underpin the socio-economic development of rural areas in particular.  I am determined to safeguard the interests of these vital sectors. <\/p>  <p>  While the main impact to date of the Brexit vote has been the effect of sterling volatility on businesses that have a significant trading relationship with the UK, the medium to long term threats include the possible introduction of tariffs on trade between the EU and UK, potential divergences in regulations and standards between the EU and UK post-Brexit, and the implications of border controls and certification requirements. Difficult challenges also arise in relation to potentially restricted access to fishing grounds and resources. Ultimately the objective is to avoid these outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  With a view to identifying common ground and building alliances for the negotiations ahead, I have held a series of bilateral meetings with EU counterparts. I also wish to ensure that agri-food and fisheries issues are at the top of the trade and economic agenda for the negotiation.  My Department and I are also in regular contact with UK counterparts, both in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I have also had meetings with major UK retailers to assure them of the continued commitment of Irish suppliers to the UK market.  <\/p>  <p>  In all of these engagements I am making clear Ireland's demand for continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as keeping the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries. In relation to fisheries, Ireland wants to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal, and to protect our quota share for joint fish stocks<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime my Department and its agencies have conducted various analyses of the likely impact of Brexit on the agri-food sector.  This is an ongoing process, and will continue, including through extensive consultation with stakeholders via the Department's Stakeholder Consultative Committee and through the All-Island Civic Dialogue process, in respect of which I have already hosted five agri-food and fisheries sectoral dialogues.<\/p>  <p>  Within my own Department, I have established a dedicated Brexit Co-ordination Unit and a Brexit Response Committee,  to prepare for, monitor and respond to developments as required. These activites span almost all of my Department's administrative and control activities.

I have also asked Bord Bia to conduct a market profiling exercise to provide a tool to assist exporters in identifying market priorities and to assist policy makers in prioritising market access objectives. I also provided for increased funding under the Rural Development Programme and Seafood Development Programme.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead.

If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant central Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat.<\/p><p>Given an intervention within a coastal area may cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal erosion risk management study, which has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options. <\/p><p>The OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications for funding from Local Authorities are considered for measures costing not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects, which meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial. <\/p><p>The OPW has published guidelines for coastal erosion risk management measures and funding applications under the Minor Works Scheme, available on the OPW website and <\/p><p>Following the severe storms of Winter 2013\/2014 and on foot of submissions made by the Local Authority, total funding of &euro;126,792 was provided by the OPW to Meath County Council under the Government decision S180\/20\/10\/1272 of 11th February 2014 to allocate funding for the repair of damaged coastal protection infrastructure.

These have included the relocation of migrants from Italy and Greece across the EU; generous humanitarian assistance to countries hosting large numbers of migrants; and Operation Sophia, the naval operation to address the evil trade of people- trafficking in the Mediterranean. Those measures have had a positive impact, but more needs to be done.In the past year the migration focus has shifted from Turkey and Greece to the Central Mediterranean Route, from Libya to Italy. In March, EU Heads of State and Government set out the EU&rsquo;s commitment to assist Libya in their Malta Declaration. That commitment is broad-ranging including capacity building, training, and the provision of equipment and support for the Libyan national coast guard and other agencies. It also seeks to ensure that there are adequate reception capacities in Libya for migrants, including through working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration.<\/p>  <p>  In April of this year the EU approved a &euro;90 million programme to step up protection of migrants and to reinforce migration management in Libya. A key objective is to provide multi-sectoral assistance and protection to migrants, refugees and host communities in different locations inside Libya, in particular inside detention centres, at disembarkation points and in urban settings. This programme is being implemented through a number of international agencies including the UN High Commission for Refugees and UNICEF. The &euro;90m is in addition to the &euro;120 million already announced by the EU for migration-related support for Libya. The EU will continue to closely monitor the migration situation in Libya to see what additional support is required.<\/p>  <p>  Migration was discussed at Monday&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) and is also on the agenda for the European Council later this week.

The waiting times for visa decisions are published on the Visa pages of each Visa Office and Embassy website.  However, it should be noted that target times for the processing of visas are established as a business target and do not constitute a legal obligation.  These business targets reflect the detailed and often complex assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will know, there has been an exponential increase since the second quarter of 2015 in the number of applications under the terms of the Free Movement Directive (2004\/38\/EC). This has given rise to a current caseload in the region of 9,000 applications overall which have to be assessed very carefully to ensure that any fraudulent applications or potential abuses of the Directive are detected and dealt with appropriately.Legal proceedings in relation to a number of similar such applications are currently before the courts, and accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that I am greatly limited in what I can say on the matter.<\/p><p>More generally, the processing time for visas in each location will vary based on a number of factors such as the number of applications, seasonal pressures, the complexity of the applications, whether further information or investigation is required, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process such applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary during the year and from one location to another.  <\/p><p>The central concern, as with all visa services worldwide, in deciding on visa applications is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard. Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between valuation of rateable property and setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. <\/p><p>  Specifically in relation to property used in the equine industry, I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that no re-classification of properties from rateable status to exempt status has occurred within the general equine industry since the Valuation Act 2001 came into force on 2 May 2002. The Valuation Act 2001 (Schedule 3, Sections 1(a) and (b)) provides that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose, are rateable. The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) and all developed land are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 to the Valuation Act. <\/p><p>The only element of the equine industry which satisfies the exemption provisions in Schedule 4 is the breeding of horses. Buildings used for breeding of horses are classified as &quot;farm buildings&quot; as defined in the Act and therefore exempt from the payment of rates under paragraph 5 of Schedule 4. On the other hand, buildings used for the training of racehorses, recreational equestrian purposes or livery premises are rateable under the Act. Such buildings would typically include stables for horses, covered riding arenas, tack rooms and ancillary buildings used to support the enterprise. <\/p><p>While acknowledging the important contribution which all elements of the equine industry make to the economy, there are no plans to reclassify these as exempt from rates. To do so would be at variance with the provisions in the Valuation Acts which maintains the long-standing position that all property occupied and used for commercial enterprises are liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other equally important services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist. This could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.<b><font color=\"#000080\"><\/font><\/b><\/p><p>Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. This has been the policy of successive governments and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office. The Valuation Acts provide for revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. The national revaluation programme's immediate objective is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, on a phased basis. This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made. <\/p><p>  Where the Valuation Office proposes to enter a new valuation or amend an existing valuation on a Valuation List, there is an extensive process available to cater for ratepayers who may be dissatisfied with the proposed valuation. A dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue of the proposed valuation certificate. The Valuation Office will consider any such representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property. If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property following consideration of the representations, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200058#WRE01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200058#WRE01900"},{"type":"question","counter":273,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[29270\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200058#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding an application for naturalisation by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":274,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the processing of the application for a certificate of naturalisation on behalf of the person referred to by the Deputy is ongoing and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  <\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.

The Government agreed that the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme (MRP) 2016-2021 would be the vehicle for implementation of the Inspectorate recommendations aimed at the Garda organisation. In support of this plan, Budget 2017 provided funding to continue to expand the number of Garda&iacute; towards 15,000, to double the Reserve to 2,000 and to double the number of civilians to 4,000 by 2021. In addition, the plan is supported by substantial capital investment of some &euro;310 million in critical ICT infrastructure, the fleet and other Garda facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Robust independent oversight is essential to ensuring that the pursuit of the reform programme is relentless over the next 5 years. To ensure that this is case, the 240 agreed recommendations of 'Changing Policing in Ireland' have been referred to the Policing Authority to monitor and assess their implementation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to report progress to me on a quarterly basis. The first two progress reports from the Authority, received in January and April, have been published on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  Priority areas include further civilianisation. This is crucial - we need to ensure that Garda&iacute; are engaged in the work that they are trained for - policing - and not carrying out administrative and technical roles that can be done by civilian professionals. The Government has set a medium term target of 20% civilians to be achieved by 2021 to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front line policing duties, and also to address critical capacity and skills gaps in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to HR, finance, ICT and corporate supports generally. <\/p>  <p>  Other priority areas include initiatives aimed at the more effective deployment of resources, more effective supervision of front-line personnel and cultural change including:<\/p>  <p>  -  the roll-out of the Divisional model of policing to support the more flexible and effective deployment of resources - four pilots are in train and will be evaluated later this year;<\/p>  <p>-  the roll-out of   Divisional Protected Services Bureaus on a phased basis starting in three Divisions;<\/p>  <p>  -  the commencement of the performance appraisal framework in the third quarter with training underway at present;<\/p>  <p>  -  the cultural audit to provide a baseline against which cultural change in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can be measured in the future will get underway shortly - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has selected a company to carry out this work after a tender process. The results of the audit will be published.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the only way to deliver world class policing in Ireland is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs and that those resources operate in an organisation whose culture is open and responsive and where the best management systems and practices are deployed.  I am confident that the reform plan that is being pursued by the Commissioner, supported by the Government and overseen by the Policing Authority, has the capacity to achieve this.  It will not be done overnight and it will not be done easily, but with the necessary support and oversight, it can be achieved over the next four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200058#WRE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reserve","counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200058#WRE03000"},{"type":"question","counter":283,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[29326\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200058#WRE03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the strength of the Garda Reserve; and the estimated full year cost of increasing it to 2,500.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":284,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that as of 12 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 644 Reserve Garda&iacute;.  It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013. The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly some 200 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track it was possible for the Commissioner and the Public Appointments Service to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves. That is now  in train and will, allowing for the selection process and necessary training of successful candidates, facilitate a start to be made on strengthening of the Reserve across every Garda Division, in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware service in the Garda Reserve is voluntary and unpaid. However, an allowance is payable to Reserve members who complete a minimum of 208 hours duty annually as a contribution towards expenses incurred in performing their duties. The allowance is currently set at &euro;1,000 per annum. In addition, the uniform cost per Reserve member is in the region of &euro;1,300.  As such, should all recruits complete the minimum of 208 hours duty annually, the full year cost of increasing the strength of the Garda Reserve to 2,500 is approximately &euro;4.3m .

GISC is located in Michael Davitt House, Castlebar, and operates on a 24\/7 basis.

Either parent of a child, whether or not he or she is also a guardian of the child, may apply to court for a direction regarding custody of, or access to, the child.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child, section 3 of the 1964 Act provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in these proceedings.  The best interests of a child are to be determined in accordance with Part V of the 1964 Act, inserted by section 63 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  Section 31 of the 1964 Act sets out a wide range of factors that the court is required to take into account when determining the best interests of the child.  These factors include the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with each of his or her parents.  Section 25 of the 1964 Act also requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in custody and access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 12A of the 1964 Act (inserted by section 58 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) provides that in making any order under the Act, the court may impose such conditions as it considers to be necessary in the best interests of the child.  The court may, where it considers it necessary and appropriate in order to protect the best interests of the child, including his or her right to the care and custody of both of his or her parents, impose conditions in relation to the holding of the passport of a child. <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the courts when making orders in relation to matters such as the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child to consider whether or not any conditions should be attached to such orders.  I have no role in the making of court orders, as this is a function of the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200058#WRE05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200058#WRE05100"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[29423\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200058#WRE05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to serious allegations at a direct provision reception centre (details supplied); and if he will ensure that these allegations are thoroughly investigated immediately.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>Any allegations of this nature are of serious concern and need to be investigated thoroughly.

The Directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross- border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another Member State rather than in their home country. S.I. 203 of 2014 provides the legal basis for the Health Service Executive to operate the EU Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross Border Healthcare in Ireland, including the reimbursement of the cost of treatment..  Under the provisions of the S.I. the HSE is charged with determining the cost of providing such healthcare in the State for the purposes of deciding on the correct reimbursement rate.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Directive, insured patients are entitled to have costs of cross-border healthcare service reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation. The HSE is pro-active in advising potential users of the Scheme that reimbursement will be at the cost of the treatment availed of abroad or the cost of providing the healthcare in Ireland whichever is the lesser. The patient is notified of this by the HSE in numerous ways: via the HSE website or in response to phone queries; on the Pro-forma invoice to be used for cases where an overnight in-patient stay is not required; and the letters issued in response to prior authorisation applications for cases involving an overnight in-patient stay will advise the actual amount to be reimbursed, based on the treatment code\/s provided by the treating\/referring consultant in the application form. The HSE also advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorization before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the National Contact Point.

Such an approach is clearly recognised in the EU Council Conclusions of October 2014 and in the Paris Agreement which outlines that efforts to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees and to pursue 1.5 degrees must do so in a manner that does not threaten food production. From the forestry perspective of land use, the Paris Agreement includes a strong recognition of the role of forests in mitigating climate change and the need to account for both emissions and removals. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These objectives are in line also with the Government&rsquo;s stated long-term ambition for the sector - an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, maintaining the current Commission proposal, which allows Ireland the potential to use up to a cap equivalent to 5.6% of 2005 emissions (2.7 Mt CO2eq per annum) from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) from the 280mt EU flexibility in order to meet its emission reduction requirements, is of major importance to Ireland.\u00a0 This flexibility is based on a combined contribution of net afforestation and cropland and grassland management activities. <\/p>  <p>  We continue to emphasise that the flexibility from the land use sector should not be seen as an offsetting proposal but rather as an effort to broaden the &ldquo;toolbox&rdquo; of abatement options available to achieve targets.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. As a result, the NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services and today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. This footprint is continuing to expand.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In\u00a0April,\u00a0eir\u00a0signed an\u00a0agreement with me committing them to follow through on\u00a0their commercial plans to provide broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas.\u00a0 Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0 My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir\u00a0meets its\u00a0obligations under the Agreement.\u00a0 A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k rollout will be published on the Departments website.\u00a0 The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and I am pleased to announce that the eir rollout\u00a0is in line with the Commitment Agreement.\u00a0\u00a0My Department has\u00a0informed me that in the period from 1 January to end\u00a0March 2017 over 30,000 premises have been passed. This brings to\u00a0over 40,000\u00a0\u00a0the total subset of the 300k premises that eir has passed since they commenced work in late 2016.<\/p><p>The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken\u00a0by eir\u00a0on commercial grounds. Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. <\/p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at .  This map finalises the\u00a0State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process. The Map\u00a0shows the extent of \u00a0the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.<\/p><p>The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>The\u00a0following table details\u00a0percentage of\u00a0 premises \u00a0to be covered by the State Intervention and through commercial investment\u00a0in the areas\u00a0identified by the\u00a0 Deputies.<table><tr><th>County Name <\/th><th>Location<\/th><th>Townland<\/th><th>% Premises within the NBP Intervention Area <\/th><th>% Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>CORK<\/td><td>Elmgrove, Sallybrook<\/td><td>Riverstown<\/td><td>9%<\/td><td>91%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DONEGAL<\/td><td>Meenacharvy<\/td><td>M&iacute;n an Chearrbhaigh<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>There are approximately 2.3m premises covering Ireland&rsquo;s 26 counties, of which approximately 542,000 (23%) premises are located in the AMBER area on the Map.\u00a0 These premises will require State intervention and are the focus for the State Intervention procurement process.\u00a0The remaining 1.8m \u00a0premises are located in the BLUE areas and will be\/are\u00a0served by commercial operators.

The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.\u00a0<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0The \u00a0three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.<\/p><p>With the finalisation of the map and following extensive dialogue with bidders, the procurement is progressing to the next stage.\u00a0This week, the Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; by 26 September 2017. This is a significant\u00a0milestone as the NBP procurement process moves to the next stage. <\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place. <\/p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.<\/p><p>The rate of demand for data services has increased\u00a0exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for\u00a0telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force. In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders. The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys,\u00a0established an Implementation Group. This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery. This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.\u00a0 I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website\u00a0 at and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. <\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas. The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty. Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200062#WRJ05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200062#WRJ05100"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[29334\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200062#WRJ05200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the monetary value of all work contracted out under the aegis of his department to external agencies or consultancies for work completed or investigations undertaken in human resources and industrial relations including hiring and interviewing of staff, disciplinary procedures and workplace related issues such as allegations of bullying and so on or dignity at work issues in each of the years 2015 and 2016.","asker":"1367","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":539,"content":"<p>I can confirm that my Department did not contract out any work relating to\u00a0human resources investigations or industrial relations issues during the years in question.<\/p><p>The information requested in relation to the agencies under the aegis of my Department is an operational matter for each agency.\u00a0\u00a0The Department will\u00a0request the relevant bodies to reply directly to the Deputy with the information requested in respect of their organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200062#WRJ05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"North-South Interconnector","counter":540,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200062#WRJ05400"},{"type":"question","counter":541,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[29381\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200062#WRJ05500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will give urgent consideration to a request from a local authority (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":542,"content":"<p>On 19 December 2016 An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the North-South Interconnector project in Ireland.

AIM supports children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-school where they can learn and socialise with their peers.

The degree of support provided depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending.<\/p>  <p>  A pre-school provider, in partnership with a parent, can apply for AIM Level 7 - additional capitation.  Where the AIM Early Years Specialist considers that a Level 7 support is critical to a child's participation in the pre-school setting, they will further consider the degree of Level 7 support required having regard to whether the child has complex or highly complex needs.  Where a child is deemed to have complex needs, payment of Level 7 capitation at the lower rate will enable the setting to supplement their staffing by 10 additional staff hours per week.  Where a child is deemed to have highly complex needs, payment of Level 7 capitation at the higher rate will enable the setting to supplement their staffing by 15 additional staff hours per week.  This can be used to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or can be used to buy in additional assistance.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to this particular child, Pobal has advised that an application was received on 23rd May 2017 for support under AIM Level 7 .

It is not feasible to carry out a financial analysis given the variability of schemes, employers and market conditions.  All defined benefit (DB) schemes are different, with their own trust deeds and scheme rules, setting out contribution rates for employers and employees.  The circumstances of each scheme may change over time depending on investment strategies and market conditions and it is not possible to estimate the number of schemes that will not satisfy the funding standard in the future and by how much.  In addition it is not possible to ascertain the likelihood of sponsoring employers changing their support for their schemes as this is likely to be driven by a combination of financial issues, investment decisions and industrial relations matters.  <\/p>  <p>  Notice periods for the termination of employer contributions are normally set out in trust deeds and rules vary from scheme to scheme.  Head 12 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill obliges employers sponsoring DB schemes to give 12 months&rsquo; notice of their intention to cease contributions, irrespective of those scheme rules.  <\/p>  <p>  It should be emphasised that these provision do not result in an increase in the rate of contributions payable by an employer but merely stipulates that the employer contributions must continue for a period of 12 months from the date of notice.<\/p>  <p>  Where an employer proposes to cease making contributions to a DB scheme an alternative pension arrangement is usually put in place, such as a DC scheme.  Any alternative pension arrangements will also result in employer costs.  Accordingly, any contributions arising in respect of the 12 month notice period, in excess of the notice period already set out in the scheme rules, must take account of the costs of any alternative pension arrangements that would have been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  The serving of notice to cease contributions is, in the ordinary course, a precursor to winding up the scheme.  Given that any such action will have a fundamental impact on the members&rsquo; benefits the purpose of the introduction of a notice period is to give employees and trustees sufficient notification of this event.  <\/p>  <p>  Head 13 of the Bill enables the Pensions Authority to determine a funding obligation that will restore DB pension schemes, which do not satisfy the funding standard or funding standard reserve, to an adequate funding position, in circumstances where a funding proposal has not been agreed.<\/p>  <p>  The funding standard defines the basis on which the liabilities of DB schemes must be calculated.  The funding standard provides a benchmark against which the &lsquo;health&rsquo; of a scheme can be tested.  Where a scheme fails the funding standard it means that unless some action is taken the scheme will not be in position to pay the benefits promised.  A funding proposal, which must be approved by the Pensions Authority, should be designed to ensure that the scheme will have sufficient assets to meet its liabilities within an acceptable period.  <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that Head 13 does not fundamentally change the current voluntary system underpinning DB schemes to a mandatory one where the obligation to fund all, or most, of a deficit arising in a scheme would rest solely with the employer.  The existing mechanisms\/processes provided for in the Pensions Act such as the development of a funding proposal, remain in place.  It is only where this process is not successful in supporting a scheme that the new provisions will apply.  The provisions are designed to encourage engagement between employers and trustees in a defined timeline to put in place measures to address a funding deficit.  <\/p>  <p>  According to the latest available returns made to the Pensions Authority, approximately 70% of the 677 DB schemes operating as of 31st December 2016 are satisfying the funding standard.  Of the schemes that do not meet the funding standard, almost all have funding proposals in place to address funding shortfalls.  Of the 677 schemes 22 are currently in wind-up. <\/p>  <p>  Head 13 will not result in any additional costs on employers who remain committed to fulfilling their obligation to their DB scheme.  Accordingly, the provision will not result in any additional costs to the sponsoring employers of the 70% of schemes currently meeting the standard or to employers of those schemes which do not meet the funding standard but where a funding proposal is in place.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions. They are to ensure the sustainability of DB schemes for scheme members and continued trust in the pensions system as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200063#WRK03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Paternity Leave","counter":584,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200063#WRK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":585,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[29286\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200063#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of fathers that have taken paternity leave since the introduction of the scheme by county; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":586,"content":"<p>Paternity benefit was introduced in September 2016 to support new fathers to take time off work within the first 26 weeks following the birth of their child.

The\u00a0building regulations\u00a0apply to the design and construction of a building\u00a0or to an extension or material\u00a0alteration of a\u00a0building.  The minimum performance requirements that a\u00a0building\u00a0must achieve are set out in the second schedule to the\u00a0building regulations.

TGD B contains guidance, compliance with which will,\u00a0prima facie, indicate compliance with Part B.  The building regulations are subject to ongoing\u00a0review\u00a0in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation.  Part B\/TGD B\u00a0is currently under review and is being split into 2 volumes.  Part B\/TGD B - Fire Safety - Volume 2 - Dwelling Houses 2017 was published earlier this year and comes into effect on 1 July 2017.

I can confirm that the same restrictions apply under Irish Building Regulations. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, the Building Regulations do not require provision of sprinklers in all residential and commercial buildings.  Provision of sprinklers may arise as a requirement where certain design features are included in buildings, such as phased evacuation in some high rise buildings with floors over 30m above ground level, or as an optional additional feature to facilitate certain building configurations.\u00a0 It is important to note that the building regulations place particular emphasis on adequate means of escape in the case of fire.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0purpose\u00a0of the Building Control Management System (BCMS) is to facilitate building control authorities, building owners, builders and construction professionals in discharging their separate responsibilities under the Building Control Act 1990.  The system provides a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector through facilitating the receipt and lodgement of commencement notices, statutory certificates and compliance documentation in line with the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200064#WRL05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200064#WRL05200"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[29337\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062200064#WRL05300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the monetary value of all work contracted out under the aegis of his Department to external agencies or consultancies for work completed or investigations undertaken in human resources and industrial relations including hiring and interviewing of staff, disciplinary procedures and workplace related issues such as allegations of bullying and so on or dignity at work issues in each of the years 2015 and 2016.","asker":"1367","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>In the years 2015 and 2016 my Department has not paid external agencies or consultants for any work in relation to investigations undertaken in human resources or industrial relations including disciplinary procedures and workplace related issues such as allegations of bullying or dignity at work issues.<\/p><p>Payments were made to external members of interview boards of &euro;1,360 in 2015 and &euro;450 in 2016 in relation to competitions held by my Department.<\/p><p>The issue of work contracted out to external agencies or consultancies is an operational matter for each individual agency or body under the aegis of my Department.

Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments. Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.<\/p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department. Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments.
