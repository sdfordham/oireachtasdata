Irish consumers are now spending more than &euro;6 billion online every year.  Yet, less than a third of this spend goes to Irish retailers, and only 23% of small Irish companies have engaged in online sales. <\/p>  <p>  To address this challenge and working in partnership with Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Office network, the Trading Online Voucher Scheme aims to get 2,000 small and micro businesses trading online by the end of this year.  This targeted initiative has the capacity to bring new sustainable jobs to all parts of Ireland: directly for the businesses that participate, and indirectly for those who supply them with expertise, training, hosting and logistics services. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, matched by the qualifying business, for investments in a digital component of their business. Initial allocations of Trading Online Vouchers were made in 2014 to the 31 Local Enterprise Offices.  By end 2014, some 550 businesses were awarded a voucher under the scheme.  Rollout of the vouchers will continue in 2015 and a number of awareness raising initiatives, including the development of online resources, are planned to drive its momentum. <\/p>  <p>  The Trading Online Voucher Scheme was informed by learnings from other schemes in the marketplace which have sought to incentivise small businesses to get online, including Google&rsquo;s Getting Irish Business Online and Dublin Chamber of Commerce Activating Dublin as well as the pilot phase of the scheme.

In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied.  The policy provides that the construction and operating costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recovered through the consumption of gas and the associated network charges.  The distance of a town from the gas network is the major factor determining the costs of building a gas pipeline.

formulation of monetary policy in the euro area   both its design and implementation   is a matter for the\u00a0Eurosystem, which comprises the European Central Bank (ECB) and the nineteen National Central Banks of the participating Member States.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Treaty, the\u00a0Eurosystem\u00a0is independent in the formulation of monetary policy, so I will not comment on the likely composition of asset purchases by the Irish Central Bank.<\/p>  <p>  Price stability in the euro area has been defined as annual inflation of close to but not exceeding 2 per cent (inflation being measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices).\u00a0 Inflation in the euro area has been below levels consistent with price stability for some time and, in fact, moved into negative territory in December.<\/p>  <p>  With policy rates effectively at zero per cent, the Governing Council of the ECB decided last week to expand its asset purchases to include\u00a0inter alia\u00a0sovereign bonds issued by the participating Member States in order to ease monetary and financial conditions further.<\/p>  <p>  From an Irish perspective, the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) is clearly part of the\u00a0Eurosystem\u00a0and will therefore be involved in implementing the monetary policy that has been decided upon.<\/p>  <p>  The ECB has indicated that its asset purchase programme in relation to sovereign bonds will be restricted to bonds with a remaining maturity of greater than 2 but less than 30 years.\u00a0 It has also indicated limits on the Eurosystem's holdings of any one issuer's bonds, taking into account existing holdings.\u00a0 These limits refer to the same 2 to 30 year maturity window.\u00a0 To be precise, holdings within the 2 to 30 year remaining maturity window will not exceed 33 per cent of an issuer's tradable bonds within the same window.\u00a0 The majority of the bonds acquired by the CBI in exchange for the Promissory Notes have more than 30 years remaining.\u00a0 Currently, this is the case for &euro;19 billion out of the original &euro;25 billion nominal issuance.\u00a0Therefore, the holding of these bonds by the CBI will, in practice, have no impact on the amounts that can be purchased by the CBI.\u00a0 While other bonds within the 2-30 year maturity window that are already held by the CBI and other National Central Banks will be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the amounts that can be purchased, I understand that this still leaves ample room for participation by the CBI in the asset purchase programme.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Bank's disposal strategy for its Special Portfolio - those bonds acquired following the liquidation of IBRC and the exchange of the Promissory Notes   remains as previously announced, i.e. it will continue to dispose of the bonds as soon as possible, provided conditions of financial stability permit.\u00a0 Disposals may or may not impact on the purchasable amounts under the asset purchase programme depending on the maturity of the bonds sold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900049#WRF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA

As a first step in that process, the NTMA, on 7 January 2015, raised &euro;4 billion through the syndicated sale of a new seven-year benchmark bond. The funds were raised at a yield of 0.867%, a historic low.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 January 2015, the NTMA announced its\u00a0Q1 2015 auction schedule. Bond auctions are scheduled for Thursday 12 February and Thursday 12 March, subject to market conditions. The details are to be announced on the Monday prior to each auction.<\/p>  <p>  The NTMA today   29 January 2015   completed an auction of Irish Treasury Bills, selling the target amount of &euro;500 million. The Treasury Bills, which have a maturity of six months, were sold at an annualised\u00a0yield of 0.00%. Total bids received amounted to &euro;1.745 billion which was 3.49 times the amount on offer.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland currently has thirteen benchmark bonds with maturities across the yield curve out to 2030, which incorporates the new 15-year benchmark bond issued in November 2014. \u00a0As part of its regular ongoing funding strategy, the NTMA considers issuance of various maturities subject to market developments and investor appetite.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The NTMA will closely monitor the market following the announcement of the expanded asset purchase programme by the European Central Bank (ECB) on 22 January. In recent months, prior to the ECB announcement, Irish Government bond yields declined steadily. It is reasonable to suggest that the expectation, on the part of financial market participants, of an announcement by the ECB that it would purchase sovereign bonds was a contributory factor in the decline. The initial reaction from the market since the ECB announcement has seen a further drop in yields. The ten-year benchmark bond, maturing in March 2025, traded at 1.07% on 26 January compared to 1.24% at close of business on 21 January, the day before the announcement. <\/p>  <p>  The NTMA advise that they cannot be definitive about the impact of the ECB's expanded asset purchase programme on Ireland's future debt servicing costs, as a range of other factors also matter. However if one of the implications of the programme is that bond yields remain low, this would be positive for debt servicing. The NTMA's funding strategy will continue to take account of the quantum of the funding requirement, market conditions, debt servicing implications, and feedback from Ireland's Primary Dealers in government bonds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900049#WRF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":146,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 57 and 58 answered with Question No. 52.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":148,"content":"<p>Question No. 59 answered with Question No. 56.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":149,"content":"<p>Question No. 60 answered with Question No. 52.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":150,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900050#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":151,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[4210\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900050#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 293 to 302 inclusively and 305 of 17 September 2014, if he will provide the information requested in respect of forms CA24 as committed to be furnished on page 5 of his reply.

The purpose of the negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is to reduce barriers to trade and investment in order to generate jobs and growth in the EU and the US.  The government fully supports this objective.<br\/><br\/>According to assessments made by the European Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost the EU's GDP by 0.5% per annum, resulting in 400,000 additional jobs across the EU. <br\/><br\/>Ireland has particularly strong economic links with the US, with over 118,000 people employed in 585 US companies here.  The total level of trade (imports and exports) between Ireland and the US in 2012 was &euro;55 billion.  The US is Ireland biggest merchandise export market.  The most recent data from the CSO shows that Ireland&rsquo;s services exports to the US increased by 40% in 2012.  Notwithstanding the present high level of trade, significant benefits could be derived from a comprehensive and ambitious TTIP.  <br\/><br\/>My Department commissioned a study on the potential impact of the TTIP for Ireland. This study is intended to assist in guiding the Irish position in the negotiations.  The study is expected to be finalised shortly and published in early 2015.<br\/><br\/>The initial findings of the study show that the benefit to Ireland would be more than double the EU average, with 1.1% added to GDP.  Other preliminary findings include increased exports (2.7%), increases in real wages (1.4%) and investment (1.6%).  Opportunities are expected mainly in manufacturing &ndash; pharmaceutical and chemical industry, electrical machinery and other advanced machinery; in certain services and in processed foods.  <br\/><br\/>The European Commission has been taking a much more open and transparent approach to these negotiations, which I believe is important and which I welcome.  <br\/><br\/>The important question of investment protection in the TTIP was the subject of a public consultation by the EU Commission, the results of which were published on 13 January, 2015.  [.]The EU Commission has stated that it will be discussing the report with Member States and the European Parliament, and with different stakeholders, and that following these consultations, it will develop specific proposals for the TTIP negotiations.

Monaghan, like many other regions, has seen positive trends in recent years, with employment in agency-supported companies expanding by 11% (or 450 jobs), and substantial improvement in the live register.

This figure continues the downward trend in the over-quota figure which was 7.15% and 6.51% in October and November respectively.  However, it is still significantly above the 1.63% over-quota position of this time last year.<\/p>  <p>  This downward trend in the over-quota figure is welcome as it reduces the exposure of farmers to super levy payments.  I note that the monthly intake of milk in December was 18% down on the same month last year and this suggests that farmers are continuing to take the necessary on-farm measures to stay close to quota limits.<\/p>  <p>  I would encourage prudent management by farmers of their output in these final three months of the quota regime to help ensure that they enter the quota-free world with as little debt as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I have, on numerous occasions, called on the Commission to take action to mitigate the impact of superlevy fines, primarily via utilisation of an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, as this would not have required an amendment to existing regulations.  However, this proposal has not enjoyed the support of a majority of MS, some of which have gone so far as to seek to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone.  Due to this opposition there is no realistic prospect of any movement on the amount of super-levy to be paid.  This is also true of a butterfat adjustment, and coming into the final months of milk quotas, farmers should manage their milk supply with this in mind.<\/p>  <p>  I am continuing to work closely with other EU Ministers and with Commissioner Hogan to examine if measures can be taken at EU level to minimise the impact of the superlevy bill.  I have already secured the Commission&rsquo;s agreement to allow for phased payments by farmers over a number of years if their co-op is willing to facilitate this.  At the Council of Agriculture Ministers&rsquo; meeting this week, the Commissioner committed to a further discussion in March when a clearer picture emerges of the extent of the superlevy bill.<\/p>  <p>  At national level I have impressed on the major banks the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015.  Following on from an agreement secured with the EU Commission, Co-ops may have a role in mitigating the impact of the global price downturn on their suppliers, with some flexibility in relation to the phasing of superlevy bills to farmers.  Furthermore Teagasc has recently commenced a series of dairy seminars throughout the country to help dairy farmers manage through 2015, while also planning the efficient development of their dairy business in a non-quota environment.  It should also be noted that the Single Farm Payment will also provide a measure of income stability during the forthcoming period.<\/p>  <p>  The superlevy bill for 2015 will of course, be the last such bill and I expect all of the relevant shareholders to do what is necessary to assist farmers through this temporary difficulty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900053#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Milk Quota Data","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900053#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[4247\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900053#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the percentage of dairy farmers out of the total number of dairy farmers around the country who are over quota; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1194","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":217,"content":"<p>The milk quota year ends on 31 March 2015.

Apart from the obvious function of representing their member&rsquo;s interests at annual EU fishing quota negotiations in Brussels etc, POs are also an increasingly important element in terms of delivering on the EUs objectives for the recently reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  The role of POs is recognised as being integral to achieving the objectives of the new CFP in terms of such important aspects as promoting the viable and sustainable fishing activities of their members, eliminating discards by helping members to avoid and reduce unwanted catches, contributing to the traceability of fishery products and the elimination of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing etc.  The organisations also play an important role in improving the conditions for the placing on the market of their member&rsquo;s fishery products, maximising economic returns for the industry while contributing to the production of a high quality, safe food source.  Other functions may include playing a role in reducing the environmental impact of fishing and, managing temporary storage for fishery products (where relevant).<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that Producer Organisations are primarily independent representative organisations operating on behalf of their members, in common with organised representative organisations throughout the Irish economy.  While the State does not have a primary oversight or control role in terms of the day to day operation of these organisations, there is regular interaction via such processes as annual quota negotiations, quota management meetings and (W.E.F 2015) the new requirement for POs to produce and submit annual or multi annual Production and Marketing Plans (PMPs).  The latter may attract funding via the new EMFF (European maritime fisheries fund) and any such funding will therefore be subject to the rules and procedures governing such funds, which will be announced by my Department later this year.<\/p>  <p>  In very general terms any organised groups of fishermen or seafood related producers may apply to the European Commission via the Member State for official recognition as a fisheries PO.  Before they can be recognised they must have a significant presence in the marketplace and meet the other criteria set down by the Commission for such recognition.  These include, having a demonstrable functioning organisation and business premises, appropriate staffing, expertise and a genuine commitment to sustainable fishing practices etc.  Thereafter such recognition can only be withdrawn if the organisation fails to fulfil its role or meet its obligations under the CFP (see above) or by not adhering to the practice and objectives of the CFP in terms of sustainable fishing and appropriate quota management fishing practices etc.<\/p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is to encourage and enable existing Producer Organisations to achieve their objectives in terms of maximising their contribution to coastal economies particularly while respecting their independence as representative bodies working on behalf of their individual members.  My Department welcomes applications from groups who may wish to consider becoming recognised POs provided they meet the criteria set out by the European Commission in this regard.  In general any evidence of non compliance by POs with the conditions for recognition laid down in article 14 of EU Reg 1379\/2013 or (W.E.F. 2015), obligations provided under Article 28 of EU Reg 1379\/2013 regarding Production and Marketing Plans may result in the withdrawal of such recognition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900053#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900053#WRK00950"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[4250\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900053#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide the European and international legislative provisions and relevant sections of same under which fishing producer organisations operating here operate; if he will provide and list the associated provisions and sections of same in legislation here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[4251\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900053#WRK01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"with regard to the State&rsquo;s regulation of fishing producer organisations, if he will provide specific administrative arrangements or legislative specifications which differ from those in the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 86 together.<\/p>  <p>  Legislative matters in relation to fisheries policy in the European Union are under the sole remit and competence of the EU and its related institutions.

It is staffed by officials from my own Department and from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and located in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p>  <p>  The remit of IYJS is to improve the delivery of youth justice services and reduce youth offending.  This challenge is met by focusing on diversion and rehabilitation involving greater use of community-based interventions and the promotion of initiatives to deal with young people who offend.  The key stakeholders supporting IYJS in its work include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Probation Service, Courts Service; Tusla, HSE, the Children Detention Schools, management and staff of community based organisations delivering Garda Youth Diversion Projects and Young Person Probation Community Projects.<\/p>  <p>  The youth justice system should be considered in its entirety, from the Garda Diversion Programme through to the Children Courts and the Children Detention Schools.  It is important to note that there it is not a simple question of choice between the Diversion Programme, community sanctions and detention.  The principles of the Children Act 2001 require the various authorities to apply, incrementally, a series of \"filters\" or tests to each case where a child comes into conflict with the law.<\/p>  <p>  The first main filter is the Garda Diversion Programme, involving at different stages and depending on the seriousness of the offence, the informal caution (without supervision) and the formal (supervised) caution, including possible involvement with a Garda Youth Diversion Project.  The second main filter is provided by the non-custodial sanctions available to the Courts, including dismissal under the Probation Act and unsupervised sanctions (fines, disqualification, peace bond, curfew etc.).  The next stage involves the Probation supervised sanctions (community service and other community sanctions). Finally, as a last resort, detention may be used.<\/p>  <p>  Gorey already has access to a &lsquo;youth justice service&rsquo;, in that a child offender, who accepts responsibility for his\/her actions, will be considered for admission to the Diversion Programme, which operates nationwide.

This high level of support has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  It is clear that accessibility, affordability and high quality childcare can play a critical role in achieving a number of Government priorities, including improving educational outcomes for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market.  To ensure that all the benefits of childcare investments are fully realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. I am establishing a cross-Departmental group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children. It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services.<\/p>  <p>  This new group will include representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.

In responding to these calls it is important to be clear on what we want this investigation to examine and that we are clear and realistic as to our approach and expectations here. My sole objective is to establish a focused Commission, which can effectively utilise all the necessary powers, to establish relevant facts in a reasonable time frame. On the basis of the available information it would not be appropriate to consider places which were children&rsquo;s homes, infants&rsquo; homes or functioned as orphanages, as being Mother and Baby Homes. These institutions did not provide the specific range of services, in particular supervised ante and post-natal facilities to single mothers and their children which are the central focus of this investigation, in the manner of the homes listed in the terms of reference.  <\/p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, it would not be accurate to suggest children&rsquo;s homes and orphanages are excluded from this Investigation as the relationships of Mother and Baby Homes with such institutions will be explored by the Commission as required by Article 1(VII) of the investigation and in the academic social history module. The Commission will investigate evidence of patterns of referral, relationships and co-operation with other entities and intermediary organisations. This will allow for examination of the practices and procedures pertaining in such institutions including intermediary bodies involved in the placement of children. <\/p>  <p>  While I do appreciate that there are many additional matters which some might like to be included, and I have responded to the specific issue raised on a number of occasions, it is important to be clear that this is not an investigation into all and every type of institution.

As we know a major investigation into historical child abuse has already been conducted by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. Its remit was to inquire into the abuse of children in institutions in the period 1940 to 1999 and the broad definition of institutions covered included settings such as the Westbank Orphanage.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the independent Commission has sufficient scope to examine a broad range of concerns, and to make a determination on their relevance to the central issues in question, and where appropriate to make any recommendations to me which the Commission deems necessary.

This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected. If a parent feels that they may have experienced discrimination, they may wish to contact the Equality Tribunal which is an independent State body set up to investigate or mediate complaints of discrimination. They can be contacted at The Equality Tribunal, Davitt House, 65A Adelaide Road, Dublin 2, Tel: +353 1 6136800 or Email: info@equalitytribunal.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a  Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900063#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Eligibility","counter":461,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900063#WRU00550"},{"type":"question","counter":462,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[4219\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012900063#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the financial assistance that will be available in respect of a PAYE earner who earns approximately &euro;60,000 gross, which would be substantially less on a net basis when tax and universal social charge are deducted therefrom, and who has three children attending third level institutions in 2015-2016 at the same time; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":463,"content":"<p>The means test arrangements of the Student Grant Scheme are applied nationally on the same basis to both employed and self-employed applicants.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Government (Rates) Act 1970 provides for the operation of rates waiver schemes. Under the provisions, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for a waiver of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property. The formulation of such a scheme is a matter reserved for the members of the relevant local authority and is subject to my consent as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p>  <p>  I would consider carefully any application received for a rate waiver scheme. In considering any such application, it has to be borne in mind that a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer could unfairly impact on existing businesses in the area by giving a competitive advantage to a certain group through a reduction in costs. As such, it would be necessary to consider State Aid rules in relation to the provision of any such relief. In addition, the introduction of a waiver scheme could further increase costs on the part of businesses that are not part of the scheme, as it is likely that they would be required to make up the cost of the waiver scheme through the payment of additional rates. This could impose an additional burden on such ratepayers.     <\/p>  <p>  Recent developments have seen some local authorities introduce locally designed business incentive schemes which promote the use of vacant commercial property. Such schemes rely upon Part 9 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides that the functions of local authorities include providing grants, loans guarantees or other financial aid to promote the interests of the local community, including economic interests.

Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation portfolio. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy. This equated to 20.9% of electricity demand, 5.7% of heat demand and 2.8% of transport being met from renewable sources.<\/p>  <p>  To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2013, 16.5% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2014, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was in excess of 2,500 MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.<\/p>  <p>  Our progress to date has already had a significant impact on the carbon intensity of our economy. The SEAI Energy in Ireland report, 2013 noted that energy related CO2 emissions fell by 3.8% and that the carbon intensity of electricity dropped to a new low of 469 grams of CO2 per kilo watt hour in 2013. Furthermore a report published by the SEAI in 2013 looking at fuel and CO2 emissions in 2012 noted that renewable electricity generation displaced 778 kilo tonnes of oil equivalent of fossil fuel, with an associated saving of almost 2 million tonnes of CO2.
