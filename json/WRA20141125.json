However, a particularly attractive feature of manufacturing in Ireland is the fact that many of the present jobs are not in the main urban areas, but dispersed into regional locations, thereby providing a valuable employment focus in areas where alternative jobs are scarce.

","asker":"956","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>The scope of the EU Commission&rsquo;s mandate to negotiate with the United States on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a very broad and comprehensive one, covering sectors and regulatory and rules issues, and investment protection including investor state dispute settlement (ISDS) is included.  The mandate is available on the EU Council&rsquo;s website at <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>The broad scope of the negotiating mandate increases the chances of a comprehensive deal.  According to assessments made by the EU Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This would provide a significant injection of economic activity and consequently bring new job opportunities.  <br\/><br\/>I have indicated in replies to previous Parliamentary Questions some of the tentative and preliminary findings from the study commissioned by my Department, concerning the economic and other impacts and potential opportunities for Ireland.  These suggest an additional 1.1% increase in GDP, higher than the estimated GDP gain from TTIP for the EU as a whole.  This also means job opportunities for Ireland.<br\/><br\/>This trade and investment agreement will build on the deep economic and wider relationship we have with the US, and will create jobs by opening up further opportunities in the US market for Irish business.<br\/><br\/>As regards ISDS, I have indicated in replies to previous Parliamentary Questions that I believe that it is a valid mechanism.  But I also believe that the experience of ISDS internationally has given rise to concerns and shows us there is room for much improvement in how the system works.  <br\/><br\/>The TTIP gives us a valuable opportunity to make improvements and create a new generation ISDS model that would respect and address legitimate concerns that have been raised.  Such improvements include having safeguards against claims that are clearly unwarranted and making sure that ISDS does not serve to constrain the rights of governments to take measures for legitimate public policy reasons.  Important features in any system would also include greater transparency in the operation of tribunals and ensuring the independence of arbitrators.  <br\/><br\/>The EU Commission is currently analysing the results of a public consultation on ISDS, carried out in response to concerns raised.  As I have previously indicated, Ireland was one of a number of EU member states that wrote to the new EU Commissioner for Trade, Cecelia Malmstrom, expressing the view that the consultation was an important step in ensuring that we strike the correct balance to ensure that governments retain their full freedom to regulate.  We also pointed out that it would be important that the outcome of this consultation would run its course and that the views expressed by our stakeholders would be carefully considered before reaching firm decisions on the way forward.<br\/><br\/>It is important to underline that the EU and the US follow the same principles that guide investment and seek to ensure a level playing field for investors.  These principles recognise the right of Governments to regulate for legitimate public policy objectives.  I will be seeking to ensure that we learn from the experience of the past and that any ISDS provisions in a future Agreement would represent a fair and reasonable option to which investors would have recourse for legitimate reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500057#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[44349\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500057#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of negotiations on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership; the way Ireland&rsquo;s interests will be protected in the talks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I have already answered 14 PQs on the matter this year and I would refer in particular to my most recent reply to written PQ 41056\/14 on Tuesday, 4th November, 2014.<br\/><br\/>I want to recall a few important points in the context of Colombia.<br\/><br\/>Sustainable development and concerns for social and human rights are at the heart of the sustainability chapter of the agreement with Colombia.  This is emphasised by the fact that, from the outset, Article 1 of the Agreement stipulates that respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights and for the rule of law is an essential element of the agreement. <br\/><br\/>During its negotiation Ireland, including officials from my Department, strongly promoted the inclusion of provisions to reflect this essential element.  The inclusion of a sustainable development chapter provides the EU with an important means to contribute to supporting positive social reforms and to the greater protection of human rights in Colombia.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the setting up of a special committee, with representatives from Colombian civil society, to monitor implementation of the sustainability provisions demonstrates how the EU can develop real leverage for promoting its values and expectations through this agreement.<br\/><br\/>The elaboration by Colombia and Peru of Roadmaps on human rights, labour rights and environmental protection in October 2012 clearly demonstrates how the agreement can incentivise an agenda for change.  Against this background, I believe the agreement with Colombia will be instrumental in encouraging economic and social progress reinforced by arrangements that strengthen the voice and role of civil society in favour of the progressive development human and labour rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500057#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises Supports","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500057#WRA02750"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[44361\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500057#WRA02800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the engagement his Department has had with the Department of Finance to increase small and medium enterprises' engagement with the Credit Review Office.

This scheme provides small companies access to the sources of knowledge, expertise and innovation available in our Universities and Institutes of Technology and in so doing acts as an important driver of knowledge transfer from 3rd   Level Institutes to industry.  The Vouchers, worth &euro;5,000, can be used by small Irish companies to explore a business opportunity or problem and purchase advice and knowledge that is new to the company.<\/p><p>  The Innovation Voucher initiative has proven to be a very useful tool in encouraging companies to embark on initial innovation projects and to collaborate with higher education research groups.  The scheme operates very efficiently while dealing with considerable numbers of projects on a yearly basis.  To date, 5,847 Innovation Vouchers have been issued to Irish companies, increasing from 428 per annum in 2007 to over 1,000 per annum in 2013.  These figures illustrate substantial growth in the scheme since its inception and the strong appetite\/demand for these important Vouchers among small businesses. <\/p><p>  A recent independent external evaluation of this programme indicated high levels of programme effectiveness and company satisfaction.  The evaluation found that 24% of respondent companies had introduced new products to their companies and 23% had improved products within the company as a result of the Voucher project.  Over the total portfolio of projects supported during the evaluation period &euro;7.65 of company turnover was created for every euro Enterprise Ireland invested.  There is frequently a lag effect between performing R&amp;amp;D and a company receiving the full impact from the activity.  As such it is always useful to include projections of future value as well as counting impacts achieved to date.  It was found that the Vouchers issued during this evaluation period are anticipated to achieve &euro;27.76 in increased turnover for every &euro;1 invested by EI by 2017.

Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations. <\/p><p>  As it stands, active members of pension schemes (through their Trade Unions) regularly engage with the employer to attempt to reach a common position as regards changes to pension schemes whether as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise.  In all such cases the outcome of that engagement can only be a collective agreement which cannot, of itself, change the pension scheme.  Any proposed changes to the scheme are effected via the mechanisms set out in the trust deeds and rules of the scheme and are at the discretion of the parties so designated in the rules\/deeds of the scheme. It may be that it is within this framework that a collective approach could be most effective.<\/p><p>  Legal advice received by the Labour Court on a number of occasions since the 1970s suggests that a person who is retired cannot be regarded as a worker and cannot be party to a trade dispute capable of investigation by the Court.

Under the National Archives Act, 1986, all census forms must be stored for a period of 100 years.

Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract.  Therefore, there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover.  Such requirements would logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract.  <\/p><p>  The Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be a source of business for SMEs.  In this regard, the Office of Government Procurement has issued public procurement guidelines to public bodies which are aimed at facilitating greater participation of SMEs in public procurement opportunities.  In relation to suitability criteria, the guidelines stress that public bodies must ensure that any criteria\/turnover levels set by them must be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract.<\/p><p>  In the case of the CSO tender, the qualification criteria in terms of a tenderer&rsquo;s financial and economic standing was set at an annual average turnover of &euro;1 million over the past 3 years.  &euro;1 million is in line with guidelines issued by the Chief Procurement Officer in April 2014 given the expected contract value and given that the tender is for the secure storage of confidential census forms (a valuable source for genealogical researchers) for a period of up to 20 years.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 72,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. <\/p><p>  The Department is undertaking a review of the maximum rent limits. I am fully aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation, including those in receipt of rent supplement, in the current market particularly in areas of high demand. However, I am concerned that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients, with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients. Raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. I plan to keep this matter under close review. <\/p><p>  I want to assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and will continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met. Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes or to increase a payment in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant. A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated earlier this year.<\/p><p>  In light of a particular concentration of the homelessness problem in the Dublin area, the Department has agreed a tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf. Since the launch of this initiative in mid-June 2014, over 220 families have had their rent supplement payments increased by the Department. <\/p><p>  Staff outside Dublin, including those in the Kildare and Tipperary regions, continue to use their discretionary powers and are actively engaging with the various organisations involved in homelessness, including the local authorities and non-Government organisations. For example, in Kildare there are approximately 25 rent supplement recipients, where there was a risk of homelessness, being paid discretionary payments for rent and a total of 85 cases in county Tipperary. The further use of the tenancy sustainment protocol will continue to be kept under review as the needs of customers and as the current rental market continues to evolve.<\/p><p>  Increasing housing supply and the reactivation of the construction activity is a critical issue for Government and key to restoring stability to the rental market. In this context, it should be noted that the Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy 2020. <\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2015, Government also announced significant capital investment of over &euro;2.2 billion for social housing for the next three years. In 2015, over &euro;800 million will be invested in a range of housing programmes representing the first major investment in housing since 2009. An additional &euro;10.5 million will be provided for accommodation and related services for homeless persons, increasing the annual expenditure for tackling homelessness to &euro;55.5 million next year. <\/p><p>  My colleague, Alan Kelly T.D., Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, is also due to publish a Social Housing Strategy shortly. This will propose a range of approaches and reforms that are innovative and challenging and will provide a basis for an improved and sustainable approach to the provision of social housing supports in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500058#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":119,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 145 and 146 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payments Eligibility","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500058#WRB02250"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[44816\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500058#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the options available to persons for financial support towards housing while they are waiting for a housing needs assessment in view of the fact that they are now not entitled to rent allowance since the introduction of the new housing assistance payment system; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[44909\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500058#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to address the gaps in the new housing assistance payment system where a person is not entitled to receive a payment until a housing need assessment has been completed (details supplied); the options available to them; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 156 together.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources.

There is no entitlement to rent supplement pending the completion of this assessment. <\/p><p>  The conditions for rent supplement have changed following the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) which has been introduced in Cork County, Limerick City &amp;amp; County and Waterford City &amp;amp; County from 15th September and was further extended to South Dublin, Kilkenny, Monaghan and Louth from 1st October 2014.

State pension transition (known then as the Retirement Pension) was introduced at that time to bridge the gap for employees who had to retire at 65.  The qualifying age for State pension (contributory) was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years, which left State pension (transition) effective for just one year.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years. This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years. State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. <\/p><p>  With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  The period for which an average pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present.  The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of demographic change.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  In 2013, despite reforms introduced in 2012, the Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;190 million, and further increases are required year-on-year to just keep pace with this demographic change.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting older people from poverty.  <\/p><p>  Following on from its analysis of its award figures for State pension (transition) in 2011 and 2012 in order to establish the impact of the abolition of State pension (transition), the Department noted that only approximately 12.5 % came from employment, with over 50% coming from another social welfare payment, and the remainder coming from a combination of people already retired, paying credits or self-employed.  This would indicate that a significant number of people have already left employment well in well in advance of pension age.  It also reflects the fact that there is no statutory retirement age in Ireland.  Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer\/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  As a result, people can retire before or after State pension age.<\/p><p>  While it is hoped that, where appropriate, workers will choose and be able to work to pension age and beyond if that is there choice, it is recognised that for some this is not viable and there are measures to support them in such circumstances.  All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66. The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. Persons aged between 65 and 66 years who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years). In the case of a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipient aged under 65 whose claim spans from one benefit year into another, a new relevant tax year requirement is not applied in the case of the job seekers entitlement relating to the second benefit year. A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseekers assistance in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of job seekers benefit within the past year.  I was happy to be able to introduce new arrangements in Budget 2014 for older jobseekers, i.e., those aged 62 and over who have left work before reaching the State pension age of 66 and who wish to claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. With effect from 1 January 2014, fully unemployed jobseekers aged 62 or over have been placed on yearly signing and are given the option of transferring to EFT payments. Furthermore, they are not subject to mandatory activation measures or activation-related sanctions but may avail of employment support. <\/p><p>  Social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions. <\/p><p>  Beyond the above measures, there are no plans to introduce a new payment, the effect of which would be to negate the decision to abolish State pension (transition) as the demographic reasons for the change remain.  Doing so would contribute to the increase in the duration of the average pension, making the system unsustainable in the longer term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500059#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500059#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[44862\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500059#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a travel allowance is payable in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":136,"content":"<p>The person concerned is currently employed on a Community Employment (CE) scheme.

An exemption may also apply where the period is less than 12 months, if a doctor is satisfied that the person is unlikely at any stage to return to the property. In both cases, the exemption only applies where the property is not occupied by any other person.<br\/><br\/>For individuals on low incomes the LPT legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the LPT charge in certain cases. A full deferral of the charge can be claimed where an individual's gross annual income does not exceed &euro;15,000 or &euro;25,000 in the case of a couple. To qualify for a partial deferral of the tax (50%), the property owner's gross annual income must not exceed &euro;25,000 or &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple. A property owner whose only income source is a Department of Social Protection (DSP) payment and who is occupying their property as their sole or main residence would qualify for deferral. In all cases, interest will be charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of 4% per annum. I am assured that the application process for deferral and partial deferral is a simple matter and can be done through the online system at or by contacting the LPT Helpline at 1890 200 255. <br\/><br\/>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that where deferral or partial deferral is not applicable, there is a wide range of payment options available to assist property owners in paying their LPT charge in a manner and at a time that best suits their individual circumstances. This includes paying in full in a single payment or making phased payments over the course of 2015.\u00a0 Phased payments include deduction at source from DSP payments, monthly direct debits from a current account and regular weekly or monthly payments to a payment service provider (An Post, Payzone, PayPoint and Omnivend).<br\/><br\/>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that full details of the various payment options, including deferral of the tax, are available on the Revenue website at .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500061#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500061#WRE01150"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[45319\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500061#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on changing the tax saver rebate scheme to be a pay and claim process in order to broaden the number of users of the scheme; if he will provide details on the number of users of the scheme in each transport system in which it currently operates in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Importantly, the mandate states that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of the EU and the Member States to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety in a non-discriminatory manner.<br\/><br\/>The mandate for provisions on enforcement of the investment protection provisions states that the Agreement should aim to provide for an effective and state-of-the-art investor-to-state dispute settlement mechanism, providing for transparency, independence of arbitrators and predictability of the Agreement, including through the possibility of binding interpretation of the Agreement by the Parties. <br\/><br\/>The mandate clearly states that an investor-to-state dispute settlement mechanism should contain safeguards against manifestly unjustified or frivolous claims. It also states that consideration should be given to the possibility of creating an appellate mechanism applicable to investor-to-state dispute settlement under the Agreement, and to the appropriate relationship between ISDS and domestic remedies. <br\/><br\/>It also states that state-to-state dispute settlement should also be included in the Agreement, but without prejudice to the right of investors to have recourse to the investor-to-state dispute settlement mechanisms. <br\/><br\/>I have indicated in replies to previous Parliamentary Questions that I believe that ISDS is a valid mechanism.  But I also believe that the experience of ISDS internationally has given rise to concerns and shows us there is room for much improvement in how the system works.  <br\/><br\/>The EU Commission is currently analysing the results of a public consultation on ISDS, carried out in response to concerns raised.  Ireland was one of a number of EU member states that wrote to the new EU Commissioner for Trade, Cecelia Malmstrom, expressing the view that the consultation was an important step in ensuring that we strike the correct balance to ensure that governments retain their full freedom to regulate.  We also pointed out that it would be important that the outcome of this consultation would run its course and that the views expressed by our stakeholders would be carefully considered before reaching firm decisions on the way forward.<br\/><br\/>It is important to underline that the EU and the US follow the same principles that guide investment and seek to ensure a level playing field for investors.  These principles recognise the right of Governments to regulate for legitimate public policy objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500063#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500063#WRG00550"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[45023\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500063#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when the Companies Bill 2012 will be enacted.","asker":"1080","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":286,"content":"<p>The Companies Bill 2012 completed Report and Final Stages in the Seanad on 30 September 2014.  &ldquo;Report Back&rdquo; to the D&aacute;il on the Seanad amendments is expected in early December.

This meets the training requirement for the Young Farmers Scheme. Farmers, who hold a foreign a ward   equivalent to the Teagasc Green Cert, can also qualify for the young farmer&rsquo;s top-up.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that in addition to income support and structural adjustment, a fundamental policy objective of the young farmers top-up is to incentivise young farmers to participate in formal agricultural education to the extent that would benefit their farming enterprise into the future. Over several years, public policy has endeavoured to enhance the level of education and training of those working in the industry. The Food Harvest 2020 Report specifically recommended that eligibility for state support should include the attainment of &lsquo;higher&rsquo; minimum levels of education or training.<\/p><p>  This objective is underpinned by the fact that better educated farmers generate higher levels of sustainable incomes. A recent major Teagasc research study &lsquo;The Economic Returns to Formal Agricultural Education&rsquo; (2014) found that formal agricultural education provides positive and significant returns in family farm income and farm productivity. The study shows that farmers having a formal agricultural education consistently have higher farm incomes than those who do not participate in further education after school. For example, family farm income per hectare was about 50% higher where the farmer had a formal agricultural education.<\/p><p>  In terms of being an investment, agricultural education was found to yield a significant rate of return to the individual farmer.

The General Scheme has been referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for scrutiny in parallel with the priority drafting of the Bill which will be introduced in the Oireachtas as soon as practicable; <\/p><p> - I have also recently published the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate&rsquo;s crime investigation report.  The report deals with crime recording and investigation, and also deals with some of the concerns raised by Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin SC in his report to the Government earlier this year in respect of certain Garda actions.  The report contains more than 200 recommendations for implementation which are being actively pursued;<\/p><p> - Work is being finalised on the establishment of a Commission of Investigation into matters identified in the Guerin report;<\/p><p> - The Fennelly Commission of Investigation set up to examine the operation of telephone recording systems in certain Garda Stations over many years, as well as other matters, recently sought an extension to its end of 2014 deadline for the submission of its report.  However, the Commission has indicated that it will submit an interim report in respect of specific issues;<\/p><p> - The report of Judge Cooke&rsquo;s inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC has been published and GSOC has published a redacted version of the report it commissioned into the possible disclosure of confidential information;<\/p><p> - The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 has been introduced to expand the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).  In addition the Bill contains measures to clarify certain matters raised in Judge Cooke&rsquo;s report and amendments are also being made to legislation in respect of the exercise of certain police powers by GSOC; <\/p><p> - The review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road Agreement  is expected to be completed shortly and encompasses all aspects of the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;<\/p><p> - I published the Report of the Independent Review Group on the Department of Justice and Equality in July and I am working closely with the Department&rsquo;s senior management team to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations;<\/p><p> - The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 has amended Garda legislation to allow Garda members to make &ldquo;protected disclosures&rdquo; to GSOC in confidence in respect of alleged Garda misconduct.  The relevant provisions of the Act have been brought into operation; and<\/p><p> - The recently enacted Freedom of Information Act 2014 extends to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500066#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500066#WRK02550"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[44808\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500066#WRK02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide in tabular form the number of arrests made, proceedings commenced and convictions for prostitution offences between the years 2008 and 2014, by offence type, county, gender and age group; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1193","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":451,"content":"<p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.<br\/><br\/>I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500066#WRK02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500066#WRK02750"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[44864\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500066#WRK02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will make telephone contact with the relevant immigration officer in respect of persons (details supplied) in Dublin 15; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the position in the cases of the persons concerned is as set out in my Reply to his earlier Parliamentary Question, No. 511 of Tuesday, 4th November, 2014 (copied beneath).<\/p><p>  As I have advised the Deputy previously, in my Replies to his Parliamentary Questions dated 10th July, 2014 (PQ No. 158) and 18th September, 2014 (PQ No. 164), I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the persons concerned were granted permission to remain in the State in August, 2007 for an initial three year period, valid to 14th August, 2010.

Such complaints will be dealt with under the auspices of the new Regulatory Authority's Complaints Committee and supported, where appropriate, by the work of the new and independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. The independence of the new Regulatory Authority and of its attendant complaints regime is, therefore, fundamental to their success and to the avoidance of any public perception that complaints about lawyers are being dealt with by lawyers or by their representative bodies.<br\/><br\/>It is also desirable that the independence of the new regulatory regime be reflected in the relevant recruitment and appointment processes for staff of the new Authority and it is considered that such appointments should be better made by the Authority itself under open and public competition. Under this scenario, it should be open to existing staff of the legal professional bodies - who would obviously possess the relevant skills and experience - to apply for those positions advertised by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, which would then fill them independently.<br\/><br\/>At the same time, it is to be acknowledged that the proposed reforms to the legal professional conduct regime will have negative implications for a number of existing and appropriately skilled staff who currently deal with public complaints made through the legal professional bodies. I am also conscious of the support given by Deputies, from across the Parties, to finding a workable solution which can reconcile the competing human resource and policy considerations involved, during their detailed discussion of these specific concerns during D&aacute;il Committee Stage of the Bill. I am, therefore, taking account of all of the concerns that are now in play as part of the ongoing consideration of the human and other resource aspects of the establishment of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority and of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. The Deputy will also wish to note that these are matters which are not solely within my own purview but continue to be negotiated between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which has overall responsibility for policy in these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500067#WRL01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":488,"content":"<p>Question No. 279 answered with Question No. 262.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":489,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500067#WRL01950"},{"type":"question","counter":490,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[45114\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500067#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on putting the text alerts system ran by community watch throughout rural Ireland on a statutory footing in order to combat rural crime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

SCU&rsquo;s differ from ordinary residential care in that the Units offer higher staff ratios, on-site education as well as specialised input such as psychology and child psychiatric services.  The child is detained as a result of a High Court Order, and not on the basis of any criminal activity.<br\/><br\/>Special care has operated under the High Court&rsquo;s inherent jurisdiction since the 1990's. The<b><\/b>Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011 creates a statutory framework for the High Court to deal with special care cases instead of employing its inherent jurisdiction. Work is currently underway to commence the Act.  Section 23 (c) and (b) defines special care as the provision of care to a child which addresses &quot;his or her behaviour and the risk of harm it poses to his or her life, health, safety, development or welfare and his or her care requirements and includes medical and psychiatric assessment, examination and treatment, and educational supervision.&quot;  <br\/><br\/>Admission criteria are set out in an information booklet (Revised 4th Edition July 2014) which is available on request from Tusla Special Care Services (01 6352537 \/ specialcare.referrals@tusla.ie).  The steps in relation to application for special care begin with the child's social worker submitting a referral to the Special Care Referrals Committee.  Membership of the Committee comprises an independent chairperson, two area managers from the Child and Family Agency and a unit manager from one of the special care units.  Where necessary, other professionals, psychiatrists for example, may be consulted in the review.  The referring social worker attends the Committee meeting and is notified of the Committee's final decision within 24 hours of the meeting.  <br\/><br\/>When applications are declined, the social work team is informed in writing of the specific criteria not met and the chairperson is available for consultation.  If the referring Social Work Department is not satisfied with the outcome, the secretary of the Committee directs them in the first instance to the chairperson for resolution and then to the national manager for special care services.<br\/><br\/>I have requested information in relation to the cost from the Agency and I will revert to the Deputy when this information is to hand.  As of September 2014 there were 17 children in special care places - 10 in Ballydowd, Co. Dublin, 4 in Gleann Alainn, Co. Cork, and 3 in Coovagh House, Co. Limerick.  At the end of September the Agency reported that there was a total of 6,470 children in care, indicating that 0.26% if those in care were in a special care placement.  County level data is not available as the Child and Family Agency collates its statistics on the basis of 17 administrative areas.

Despite the difficult budgetary position that has prevailed in recent years, the Government has maintained the investment in these programmes, in particular the free pre-school programme which alone costs &euro;175m annually.  While considerable progress has been made in correcting the overall budgetary situation, the funding available to my Department does not allow for the consideration of an increase in the capitation paid to childcare providers participating in the ECCE programme at this time.<br\/><br\/>These programmes, and in particular the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, provide a guaranteed source of income to participating services and given that many parents would otherwise not be able to avail of pre-school care and education for their children, the funding has ensured that many childcare services, both commercial and community, have the resources to continue to operate.  <br\/><br\/>All international research and experience shows that the supports provided to children in their early years results in improved outcomes for children and an economic and social return to the State, but only where the services provided are of a high quality.  Following the broadcast of the Primetime programme in May 2013, Minister Fitzgerald announced the Early Years Quality Agenda which comprises a range of actions designed to improve quality in early years services.  These actions include the strengthening of the Early Years Inspection system, the introduction of a registration system for all pre-school services and supporting the implementation within early years services of the S&iacute;olta Framework and the Aistear Curriculum.<br\/><br\/>Within the broader context of quality improvement, the Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate has been asked to lead and organise focused inspections on the quality of educational provision in early childhood education settings participating in the ECCE programme.  These education-focused inspections will concentrate on the improvement of educational provision for pre-school children, and will complement the inspections undertaken by the Child and Family Agency Early Years Inspectorate.<br\/><br\/>A National Early Years Quality Support Service, known as <i>Better Start<\/i>, has been introduced.  This service has 30 graduates in early childhood care and education who will work directly with services to improve quality, including assisting services in the implementation of the S&iacute;olta Framework and the Aistear Curriculum.  The National Manager of the Service has been recruited and the Early Years Specialists took up their posts in October.  The new service will work closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations to support service providers in improving the quality of their services.  The work of the service will be based on a new Practice Guide based on S&iacute;olta and Aistear, which is currently being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500069#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":564,"content":"<p>Question No. 307 answered with Question No. 301.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":565,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500069#WRN01750"},{"type":"question","counter":566,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[45295\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500069#WRN01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason for the delay in responding to correspondence (details supplied) regarding mother and baby homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":567,"content":"<p>I am advised that a reply issued on the 19th August to the Deputy's initial correspondence of 6th August regarding Mother and Baby Homes.

These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and often on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. <\/p><p>  The HSE has been engaging with the manufacturer, Alexion Pharma, for some time in relation to the drug Eculizumab.  I understand that in 2010 following prolonged discussions and in the absence of sufficient information to make a long term permanent decision around this agent, the HSE entered into an access with evidence development agreement with Alexion Pharma and St James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin whereby the HSE provided a fund (almost &euro;10m, inclusive of VAT) for three years (2010-2012) sufficient to treat 10 patients (the expected number of patients to be identified for treatment over that time period). At the end of this period, Alexion was expected to have developed additional evidence to allow the HSE to make a long term decision in relation to the funding of this incredibly costly agent. The HSE honoured the terms of that agreement.<\/p><p>   The agreement lapsed and a formal re-assessment process was triggered as was agreed with Alexion \/ St James&rsquo;s in 2010. Pending consideration of the outcome of the assessment, the HSE continued the funding commitments entered into with Alexion on behalf of the original 10 patients. The HSE has released funding of &euro;1.9m in the first 8 months of 2014 to fund treatment for these 10 existing patients. <\/p><p>  Many countries have struggled to accept the pricing point put forward by Alexion. The medicine in question requires &euro;355,000 per annum plus 23% VAT (multi-year commitment) to be found for each additional patient treated.<\/p><p>  The HSE continues to try to engage with the pharmaceutical company to arrive at a pricing point that would assist it in its efforts to fund this medicine for as many patients as possible. The HSE met the company again this month and is waiting on the company's response following that engagement.  It is worth noting that the current Irish list price of &euro;4,557.50 per vial substantially exceeds the list price in the UK (&pound;3,150 sterling).<\/p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Department, and the HSE, fully understand the concerns of patients regarding the availability of this drug. While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should re-imburse every licensed medicine for whatever price the drug company demands, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that the better interests of the health service require that we re-imburse only the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500070#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":590,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500070#WRO00500"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[44834\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500070#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 153 of 13 November 2014, if he will undertake a full risk assessment to ensure that there are no negative healthcare results for the people of counties Wicklow and east Carlow as a result of the redesign of the primary percutaneous coronary intervention programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":592,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[44880\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500070#WRO00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 153 of 13 November 2014, if he will undertake a full review of the way the Health Service Executive made and announced a premature decision, which resulted in a temporary suspension of ambulance transfers to St. Vincents University Hospital for patients suspected of having ST elevation Myocardial Infarction, and caused widespread concern; if he will confirm that no such premature announcements are made in future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":322,"qnumall":"[44881\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500070#WRO00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 153 of 13 November 2014, if he will ensure that some form of stakeholder outreach is included in the redesign of the Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention programme, which is currently underway before any decisions are made and announced, including dialogue with frontline workers, paramedics and first responders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":594,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 316, 321 and 322 together.<\/p><p>  St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital (SVUH), St. James&rsquo;s Hospital  and Mater Misericordiae University Hospital operate as designated 24\/7 Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PPCI) centres for the Greater Dublin Area.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the withdrawal of SVUH as a 24\/7 PPCI  centre, the HSE has advised my Department that a premature decision was taken in this regard without the normal notifications to relevant stakeholders.

All people ordinarily resident in the State are eligible for publicly-funded hospital services.  In addition, about two-fifths of the population are eligible for publicly-funded primary care services.  The Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, which provides an entitlement for all children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees, was enacted on 25th July 2014.  Under a Framework Agreement, the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO are engaged intensively on the introduction of GP services without fees for children aged under 6.  The Government's aim is to have universal GP care without fees for children under 6 years implemented early next year subject to the conclusion of the present discussions and the completion of a fee-setting process.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Director-General of the HSE established an Expert Panel to examine and recommend the range of medical conditions that would be considered as a basis of eligibility for health services.  The Expert Panel report was presented to the Minister last month.<\/p><p>  The Expert Panel concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  It also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card and recommended that the existing eligibility assessment should be extended beyond financial hardship to include an assessment of the burden of a medical condition, but it noted that there are significant challenges to including such an assessment.  It is however recognised by Government that there is a need for discretion and sensitivity in assessing eligibility, which will take into account an individual's medical condition and needs, rather than a list of specific medical conditions. In that context, the Government has approved a number of immediate improvements that the HSE is making to the medical card system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500071#WRP02200","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":652,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500071#WRP02300"},{"type":"question","counter":653,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[45006\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500071#WRP02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide details of those resources being invested to assist in research into Huntington&rsquo;s disease and care for Huntington&rsquo;s disease patients","asker":"1034","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":654,"content":"<p>The supports provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to people with Huntington's Disease involve a multi-disciplinary team approach.

As the Deputy may be aware, the tobacco industry has argued that standardised or plain packs would be easier to forge and would lead to growth in illicit trade of tobacco products.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they are satisfied that the standardised packaging legislation will not have a significant impact on their work in relation to illicit trade in tobacco products.  Revenue relies on the tax stamp as a key means for them to distinguish between legal and illegal products, irrespective of the way in which the cigarettes are packaged.  Tax stamps will remain a fixture on tobacco products following the introduction of standardised packaging, and contain all features possible to minimise the risk of counterfeiting. <\/p><p>  Combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners.  They have extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and in addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.<\/p><p>  The 2014 EU Tobacco Products Directive sets out further measures to be adopted by Member States in order to tackle illicit trade; in particular, it includes provisions relating to traceability and security features of tobacco products.  Tobacco products will be marked with a unique identifier and security features.  This will allow for their movements to be recorded and for such products to be tracked and traced throughout the EU.  This will also facilitate the verification of whether or not tobacco products are authentic.<\/p><p>  Following Government approval, Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations signed the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, adopted by the Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), in New York on 20 December 2013. The new international treaty is aimed at combating illegal trade in tobacco products through control of the supply chain and international cooperation.  As a key measure, Parties commit to establishing a global tracking and tracing system to reduce and eventually eradicate illicit trade.<\/p><p>  In view of the above, it is anticipated that there will not be a significant impact on illicit trade of tobacco as a result of the introduction of standardised packaging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500072#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Funding","counter":691,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500072#WRQ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":692,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[45071\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500072#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that in October 2014 the Health Service Executive notified a service provider (details supplied) in County Galway of a &euro;156,600 cut in funding for 2014; his views that it is reasonable that such a reduction should be imposed so late in the year; and his further views that this will impact directly on frontline services and vulnerable service users","asker":"1185","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":693,"content":"<p>The Government is fully committed to ensuring the on-going delivery of vital services and supports to people with disabilities within available resources.  <\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) is currently in the process of preparing its 2015 National Service Plan including its disability services programme for children and adults with disabilities. <\/p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy on Ability West, Galway, as this is a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

The Special Delivery Unit is working with hospitals to improve access times to appropriate care and to reduce the length of stay for key conditions.  New pathways of care continue to be introduced to improve patient flow through hospitals including minor injury, medical assessment and surgical assessment units and specific pathways for frail older patients.  This work is supported and facilitated through the clinical programmes and the involvement of senior clinical decision makers at all stages of the patient journey.

Funding for the DTSS, which was capped at the 2008 level of &euro;63 million, has increased to &euro;75 million this year to take account of the increase in the uptake of services.<\/p><p>  The HSE introduced Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for patients eligible for the DTSS in November 2011.  This is linked with prior approval of claims for treatment such as endodontics.  This has enabled increased uptake of such treatments.<\/p><p>  Dental services for children up to 16 years of age and persons of all ages with special needs are provided by the Public Dental Service of the HSE through its dental clinics.  All HSE dental clinics prioritise emergency care for children up to 16 years of age, treatment for special needs patients and screening of children aged from 11 to 13 years, including referral for orthodontic services where necessary.  Other services, including screening of children 6 to 8 years, are provided but may be deferred in clinics where there is pressure on resources.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health is in the process of developing a new oral health policy.  This is a three year project which commenced in 2014 and is led by the Chief Dental Officer. <\/p><p>  The project will have three key parts. The first is a needs assessment, which will inform how new services should be provided.  The second part will be a review of resources.  Thirdly, there will be consultation with stakeholders, including professional groups and the public, on new ways of delivering oral health services. <\/p><p>  The emphasis on prevention rather than intervention is a cornerstone of this policy development.  The project is prioritising older adults in the first instance.  The ethos and principles for adults will provide a framework for the policy on children which will follow.  In line with the 'Healthy Ireland' policy framework there will be a focus on a life course approach and the 0-5 age group will be considered in this context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500073#WRR02100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":749,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500073#WRR02150"},{"type":"question","counter":750,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[45246\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500073#WRR02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a continuous positive airway pressure, CPAP, machine will be provided in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny in view of the fact that the funding has been awarded under the sundry section of the long-term illness card; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":751,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has statutory responsibility for the administration of the primary care schemes, including the Long Term Illness Scheme, therefore the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p><p>  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500073#WRR02300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"question","counter":753,"qnumday":371,"qnumall":"[45247\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500073#WRR02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the rheumatology out-reach clinic has not been reinstated at Letterkenny General Hospital in view of the fact that suitable accommodation is available and the consultant has returned from maternity leave; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":754,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

Ireland is a member of a trading union, and external trade policy is a competence of the European Union. It is not therefore possible to exclude settlement products from the Irish market alone. Ireland has stated previously that it could support the exclusion of settlement products from the EU market, but there is no possibility at present of such a policy receiving sufficient support within the Council.<\/p><p>  The principal current sanction against settlement products is that they are not eligible for the lower tariffs on import to the EU which are applied to goods from Israel and from many other states. The European Commission has established certain administrative measures to distinguish settlement goods from those originating in Israel, based on post codes. The onus is on the importer to demonstrate that the goods being imported are entitled to the lower rate.<\/p><p>  As with imports from any area where differing tariffs are applied, the possibility exists of exporters or importers deliberately seeking to confuse eligibility so as to benefit from lower tariffs. This is a standard problem for police and revenue authorities to combat in the usual way. <\/p><p>  Existing place of origin rules in the EU do not require place of origin marking on all goods. Where such origin is marked, however, on either a statutory or voluntary basis, it requires that such marking be accurate, in other words that goods produced in settlements should not be labelled as coming from somewhere else, including Israel. Moves are being considered to issue guidelines to make this distinction more clear to importers and retailers, but it is already a principle in EU law.<\/p><p>  Trade statistics are compiled by the Central Statistics Office and those in respect of imports from Israel and\/or the Occupied Palestinian Territory are on public access on that Office&rsquo;s website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500074#WRS02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":792,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500074#WRS02150"},{"type":"question","counter":793,"qnumday":386,"qnumall":"[44809\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500074#WRS02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide an up to date figure on the number of undocumented Irish in the USA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":794,"content":"<p>While it is difficult to estimate the exact number of undocumented Irish citizens in the US, Irish immigration centres, community groups and the relevant US authorities, estimate the number at around 50,000.

My colleagues in Government and I meet regularly with our counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive in the various NSMC formats to review progress in all areas of North South co-operation.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the North South Ministerial Council being a vehicle for reconciliation and better understanding on the island, it is also a mechanism for ensuring a more efficient delivery of services and a more coordinated approach to job creation and recovery, North and South.  While there has been valuable progress in cooperation through the NSMC, the Government is also firmly committed to developing cross border cooperation across a broad range of areas including those which are not part of the currently mandated NSMC work programme.<br\/><br\/>To date in 2014, there have been nineteen NSMC Ministerial meetings.  It is expected that further meetings will take place in the coming weeks.  Indeed, I am looking forward to meeting with our Northern Ireland Executive colleagues at the upcoming Plenary meeting in December. <br\/><br\/>The 18th Plenary meeting of the NSMC took place in Dublin Castle on 3 October 2014.  At this meeting, discussions covered a wide range of financial, economic and EU matters including the employment situation in both jurisdictions and measures to encourage job creation.  Ministers referenced the positive job announcements which had been made recently both North and South.  Progress on the disposal of NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland portfolio was welcomed by the Council.  Also discussed were actions to build trade links with developing markets, attraction of foreign direct investment and issues relating to banking, in particular lending to SMEs, economic and budgetary challenges facing both administrations and measures aimed at rebalancing the Northern Ireland economy. As regards the latter, the Government is involved in supporting the UK&rsquo;s investment package for Northern Ireland, which is aimed at rebalancing the economy and tackling division.<br\/><br\/>We also noted the opportunities for tourism and trade through the hosting of all-island events and agreed to continue to cooperate on a possible joint bid for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.  A particular measure of note is the introduction of the joint British-Irish Visa Scheme which has come into operation in China and is due to be rolled out to cover India in the coming months.  This will have very significant positive benefits to the tourism sector on the island.<br\/><br\/>We noted that the draft Programmes for the new INTERREG V and PEACE IV Programmes for the period 2014 &ndash; 2020 have been submitted to the EU Commission. It is expected that the PEACE programme will amount to some &euro;269 million while the INTERREG programme is expected to total c. &euro;282 million. The new PEACE programme will focus on Social Inclusion and Combatting Poverty while the new INTERREG program&rsquo;s focus will be spread across four themes: Research and Innovation; Environment; Sustainable Transport; and Health. <br\/><br\/>It was agreed that several other European funding programmes may present opportunities for cross-border cooperation to maximise the drawdown of EU funding to the island and that we should examine this issue further at the December Plenary.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the St. Andrews Agreement Review, the Council noted that discussions on Sectoral Priorities have now taken place, following the decisions taken at the last NSMC Plenary in November 2013 and the NSMC Institutional meeting in January 2014.  These discussions focused on efforts to support economic recovery, job creation, ensuring the best use of public funds and the most effective delivery of services for citizens. Ministers agreed that it had been useful to review progress and identify opportunities within the existing agreed work programmes and noted that a report on other priorities identified during the Ministerial discussions will be brought to the next NSMC Institutional Meeting.<br\/><br\/>We also discussed the North West Gateway Initiative noting the conclusion of the consultation process that had been carried out with regional stakeholders and agreed that further consultation with relevant Government Departments should be undertaken. The Council also reconfirmed its commitment to a future meeting of Ministers and officials in the North West to consider future strategic approaches to the development of the region.<br\/><br\/>At the Plenary Ministers noted that the child protection work programme, agreed in the NSMC Health sector, continues to be progressed. An &lsquo;app&rsquo; to allow access to the North South Child Protection Hub was launched by Childlink in February 2014. There was a discussion on child protection and e-Safety issues and the Council agreed to discuss this item further at the NSMC Plenary in December<i>.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The Plenary meeting also noted developments relating to the operation of the North South Implementation Bodies. As regards the Language Body, comprising an Foras na Gaeilge and Ulster Scots Agency, the relevant Ministers are scheduled to meet soon.  It is expected that amongst other agenda items for discussion, funding arrangements for Foras na Gaeilge will also be discussed at the meeting.<br\/><br\/>The Council also noted the current position on the North South Consultative Forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500075#WRT01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emigrant Support Services","counter":823,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500075#WRT01650"},{"type":"question","counter":824,"qnumday":393,"qnumall":"[41668\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500075#WRT01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide details of the emigrant support programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":825,"content":"<p>The Emigrant Support Programme, ESP, provides funding to not-for-profit organisations and projects to support Irish communities overseas and to encourage closer links between these communities and Ireland.<\/p><p>  The focus of the Emigrant Support Programme is on initiatives that address the needs of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable Irish emigrants; enhance access for Irish emigrants and Irish community organisations to local statutory and voluntary services; foster a more vibrant sense of community and Irish identity amongst the Irish abroad; and encourage closer links between Irish communities abroad and Ireland, to the benefit of both.<\/p><p>  In addition, since 2009, the Programme also supports projects aimed at creating practical results orientated links between Ireland and the global Irish, and projects that emerged as a consequence of the Global Irish Economic Forum and its follow up.<\/p><p>  Funding of &euro;10,546,458 was awarded under the Emigrant Support Programme in 2013, with &euro;11,455,364 awarded in 2012 and &euro;11,297,365 in 2011.

These talks bring together the Northern Ireland Executive Parties and the two Governments, in order to address a number of key issues that have badly impacted on the reconciliation agenda and on economic renewal.  These include budgetary and financial matters, legacy issues (parades, flags and identity, dealing with the past), institutional issues including the effective functioning of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive, and outstanding commitments from the Good Friday and St. Andrew's Agreements.  The Irish Government&rsquo;s interest in the talks is to ensure that the Agreements, and effective partnership government which is at the heart of the Agreements, work for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>  Discussions have taken place on each of the streams, including on outstanding elements of the Agreements.  The principles and values of the Good Friday Agreement and St. Andrews Agreement are essential to peace and reconciliation in Ireland and across these islands.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p><p>  NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. <\/p><p>  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. This process has been embedded by NEPS psychologists in the Primary sector with the production by the Department of Special Educational Needs &ndash; A Continuum of Support guidance and resource materials which has been distributed to all schools since 2007\/8. In late 2010 similar support documentation was produced in relation to Emotional and Behavioural difficulties in the Primary sector and in relation to a formal Post-Primary Continuum process. <\/p><p>  The continua described above all involve a graduated problem solving model of assessment and intervention in schools processes which moves from basic classroom based interventions to more specialised and individual interventions and comprise three distinct school based phases characterised as follows:<\/p><p>Classroom Support &ndash; is an intervention which is co-ordinated by the Class Teacher and is carried out in the regular classroom.<\/p><p>School Support - is an assessment and intervention process which is usually co-ordinated by the learning support\/resource teacher working alongside the class teacher. Interventions at this stage will be additional to those provided through classroom support.<\/p><p>School Support Plus &ndash; is generally characterised by the school requesting the involvement by the relevant external service (predominantly NEPS) in more detailed assessment and development of intervention programmes.  This level of intervention is for children with complex and\/or enduring needs and whose progress is considered inadequate, despite carefully planned interventions at previous levels. <\/p><p>  The staged model recognises that pupils present with a wide range of issues and difficulties and allows for their amelioration and intervention at the level most appropriate to the particular need. The continuum approach ensures that pupils presenting within this range are dealt with quickly and at the appropriate level without the establishment of a waiting list for formal assessment.<\/p><p>  If parents have specific concerns about the educational progress of their child I would advise, in the first instance, that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist.<\/p><p>  For the Deputy's information, during 2013\/14 NEPS psychologists engaged directly with over 8,000 named individual pupils, SCPA psychologists with an additional 1,500 (approx.).  At a broader level NEPs psychologists consulted with schools in respect of an estimated 25,000 unnamed pupils in the period.<\/p><p>  I can also inform the Deputy that this Government has maintained, and indeed increased, the number of psychologists directly employed in NEPS.

It contains a number of changes, adopted by Government, to immigration policy that governs the recruitment of international students by providers.<\/p><p>  The current Internationalisation Register will be replaced by an 'Interim List of Eligible Programmes for Student Immigration Permission' from 1st January 2015.  The Interim List will act as a reference point for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of the Department of Justice and Equality in considering visa and residency applications from non-EEA applicants wishing to study on a full-time basis in Ireland and to avail of a concession to take up casual employment in the State with certain restrictions.

Therefore providers will not be permitted to recruit non-EEA students to programmes leading to the awards referred to by the Deputy.

This integrated language curriculum is scheduled to be implemented in schools from September 2016.<br\/><br\/>The current provision of connectivity to primary schools will not in any way impede the proposed changes to the primary curriculum.

Appropriate measures will therefore be adopted by the NCCA to ensure that all teachers are able to engage with this and other new curricula as they are rolled out to primary schools.<br\/><br\/>  Under the Schools Broadband Access Programme the Department provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary schools. A new framework was put in place in 2012 for the provision of this service, as a result of this the number of service providers has been expanded from 6 to 14 with the aim of ensuring that satisfactory solutions would be awarded to all schools.  For those primary schools with speeds of less than 2Mbit\/s per second, a number will receive higher speed services in the near future and others are currently included in a tender under the framework for improved solutions.

This is on foot of recommendations set out in the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Policy Advice on &quot;Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (May 2013) and the recommendations of the NCSE Working Group Report &quot;A Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Following the publication of these reports, my Department advised that it would commence the process of gathering information which would be required to develop the proposed new model, to allow its impact to be assessed, and to assess if, and from when, the model could be implemented. Part of this process involves the collection of information in relation to the social context of schools.<br\/><br\/>The working group report recommended that a school's social context should be used because it can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have.  The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders.<br\/><br\/>The report also noted that a school within a disadvantaged social context may have a higher share of students presenting with emotional or behavioural disorders.  While some of these needs are likely to be reflected in low test scores, others may not, as students with relatively high levels of educational achievement can have emotional and behavioural disorders.<br\/><br\/>Accordingly, it was recommended that consideration of a schools social context should form part of any proposed new resource allocation model.<br\/><br\/>Pending the availability of a more objective source of information, the working group stated that it was confident that survey reporting by school principals could produce robust up to date data on school context in a similar manner to DEIS and earlier initiatives.<br\/><br\/>The Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a survey of schools to assist the development of an educational profile.<br\/><br\/>Though recognising that all schools would not be able to have specific detail regarding all of the questions asked in relation to their pupil populations, schools were asked to provide their best possible estimates in relation to the questions being asked in the survey, in order to ensure that as accurate as possible a social context allocation component of any revised allocation model could be developed for each school.<br\/><br\/>At all stages of the development of the advice and in particular in the work of the working group there was comprehensive consultation with education partners and stakeholders and through this consultation there was awareness and broad support for the proposed approach including the deployment of a survey.<br\/><br\/>The data which schools were requested to return as part of the survey were non-personal, anonymised data.  Schools were not asked to return data in relation to the social circumstances of individual pupils.  <br\/><br\/>  Schools were also advised that the ERC had put in place a dedicated phone help line in order to provide assistance and support to schools in completing the questionnaire.  I understand that many schools used this help line to gain assistance in completing the questionnaire.<br\/><br\/>Whereas I understand that the return of this survey has caused extra work and some difficulties for some schools, I am confident that having up to date social context data will be highly beneficial to the Department and the NCSE in developing proposals for a new profiled allocation model for schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500080#WRY00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":1004,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500080#WRY00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1005,"qnumday":473,"qnumall":"[45258\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500080#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide a guarantee that a school (details supplied) in County Cork will be completed and ready for students by September 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1006,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the school referred to by the Deputy is included in my Department's 5 year plan to go to construction in 2015\/16.<\/p><p>  The disposal of the lands concerned to facilitate the new school building has recently been approved by Cork County Council.

Those arrangements are scalable and allow affected students the opportunity to take up an alternative arrangement at significantly discounted rates.  In addition to those arrangements, the Task Force also established a website, www.studenttaskforce.ie, which sets out relevant information for students.<\/p><p>  In addition, we also announced robust regulatory reforms of the international education sector on that date.

It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47 million pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015.<br\/><br\/>The SICAP is one of my key priorities.

Stage two (Invitation to Tender), got underway on 20 October and will involve the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, in Local Authority areas, to deliver the programme.

Oversight of activity by industry and by local building control authorities has improved immeasurably and authorities have ready access to detailed data on projects via the online Building Control Management System. The online system streamlines building control administration and enables authorities to identify risks and track progress.<\/p><p>  A Framework for Building Control Authorities was adopted by the City and County Management Association on 17 July 2014 &ndash; these common protocols add clarity, efficiency and consistency to building control activities across the local government sector. <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the new regulatory framework represents a reasonable and appropriate response to the many building failures that occurred in the past decade. The enhanced professionalism and accountability arising from the arrangements under the new Regulations will lead to improved quality and reduce risk within the construction sector. This will in turn lead to market conditions more conducive to insurers and a wider availability and use of latent defects insurance. However, the Government has undertaken to explore the potential for latent defects insurance on construction projects as part of the wider reform of building control arrangements and this matter is currently being progressed within my Department.<\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of cost, I refer to the reply given to Questions Nos. 259, 268, 269 and 285 of 4 March 2014 which sets out comprehensively how the impact of the regulations, including the cost impact, was viewed by my Department in the context of the comprehensive public consultation that informed and preceded the making of the regulations. A number of cases have, however, been brought to my attention whereby consumers have been quoted exorbitant charges for professional services in relation to residential construction projects, particularly single house projects. The new regulations support improved competence and professionalism which will provide additional work opportunities for competent practitioners and construction professionals. However, the consumer should not have to pay a premium for such services and, if concerns about value for money for consumers prove to be well-founded, I will consider any reasonable and appropriate steps that may be required to address the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500082#WRAA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1069,"content":"<p>Question No. 494 answered with Question No. 490.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Expenditure","counter":1070,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500082#WRAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1071,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[44807\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500082#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has directed Sligo County Council to include measures in its annual budget to ensure that the council will return a surplus of &euro;1 million on its revenue account for 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1193","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1072,"content":"<p>The continued deterioration of Sligo County Council&rsquo;s financial position is of serious concern.

Local authorities and approved housing bodies are continuing to work on projects announced earlier this year under a national &euro;68 million local authority housing construction programme to provide 449 new social housing units and &euro;46 million to approved housing bodies to provide 416 social housing units for people with special housing needs.<\/p><p>  Approved housing bodies will continue, under the Capital Assistance Scheme, to play an important role in the future delivery of accommodation for persons with specific categories of housing need, including older people, people with an intellectual, physical or mental health disability, homeless people, returning emigrants and victims of domestic violence. The target for 2015 under this Scheme is for approved housing bodies to deliver around 440 units of accommodation for people with a specific housing need. In evaluating future applications under these Schemes, priority will be given to those approved housing bodies that have demonstrated a commitment to good governance and sound management. Engaging fully with the voluntary regulation code for approved housing bodies will be a clear statement of that commitment.<\/p><p>  The Capital Advance Leasing Facility scheme facilitates the securing of finance by approved housing bodies from sources other than the Exchequer, including from the Housing Finance Agency and private lending institutions. The scheme provides a capital equity injection which assists approved housing bodies in securing private finance. To date over &euro;16 million has been advanced to approved housing bodies under CALF, which has supported the provision of 551 social housing units, and this delivery is expected to continue and expand in 2015.<\/p><p>  More broadly, plans in relation to the future delivery of social housing are now being finalised as part of a new Social Housing Strategy which will contain clear, measurable actions to increase the supply of social housing, based on innovative solutions that will harness new funding streams, in order to continue to protect the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society. It will also highlight the important role of the voluntary housing sector in future social housing delivery.<\/p><p>  The overall social housing funding provision for 2015 has been increased by in excess of &euro;200 million, with capital funding increasing by &euro;180 million, which will allow for significant expansion in social housing provision. The specific allocations to be provided for each of the various funding schemes and programmes will be published in the 2015 Revised Estimates Volume in December. That will include the breakdown of my Department's Social Housing Investment Programme and at that point, my Department will be working with all local authorities to agree individual allocations across all the social housing programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500083#WRBB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Applications","counter":1116,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500083#WRBB01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1117,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[45057\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500083#WRBB01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the status of an application to Mayo North East Leader Partnership in respect of an agricultural show (details supplied) in County Mayo, the reason for the continuing delay; if it will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1118,"content":"<p>I understand that Mayo North East LEADER Partnership expects to be in a position to submit a claim on behalf of the project promoter to my Department for payment very shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500083#WRBB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1120,"qnumday":511,"qnumall":"[45060\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500083#WRBB02200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding an application to Mayo North East Leader Partnership in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo; the reason for the continuing delay; if same will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1121,"content":"<p>In line with the 'bottom-up' approach to rural development, there are 35 Local Action Groups (LAGs) contracted, on my Department's behalf, to deliver the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) throughout the country.<\/p><p>  The relevant LAG in respect of the project referred to is Mayo North East LEADER Partnership (MNELP), which is the principal decision-maker in relation to the allocation of project funding in that area of Mayo.

It is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers. The PSO levy is vital to enable Ireland to meet its 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.<\/p><p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception. The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002). The annual PSO levy amount for 2014\/2015 is &euro;335.4 million. This equates to &euro;64.37 per annum for residential customers, &euro;221.66 per annum for small to medium sized business customers and &euro;34.20\/kVA for medium and large customers. The levy amounts for 2013\/14 amounted to &euro;210.9 million, equating to &euro;42.87 per annum for residential customers, &euro;129.83 per annum for small to medium sized business customers and &euro;18.47\/kVA for medium and large customers.<\/p><p>The biggest driver for the levy rise for this year is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is currently estimated to be around 10% lower than last year. This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover their allowed costs. The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by lower international gas prices in evidence since spring 2014. This drives up the proposed PSO levy. However, if these lower gas and wholesale prices are sustained, it will reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay. In turn, suppliers should be in a position to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase. I note increased competition in the retail electricity sector recently which should help offset some of this increase. The CER is tasked with retail market monitoring and executes this role vigorously to ensure competition leads to the fairest prices for customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500086#WREE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":1229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500086#WREE01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1230,"qnumday":555,"qnumall":"[45255\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500086#WREE01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide the names of the 78 areas in County Donegal that will require State intervention; if the Government will invest in fibre connections in these areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday, I launched a public consultation on the National High Speed Coverage Map 2016. This allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether or not their premises\/home is included in the Government&rsquo;s proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on a county by county basis as to which villages and townlands are to be included.<br\/><br\/>This map can be accessed at . There is a wealth of data and information available here to better inform citizens about the detail of the Government&rsquo;s ambitious plan to ensure all parts of Ireland have access to high quality broadband services.<br\/><br\/>The plan envisages dealing conclusively with rural connectivity issues so that current and future generations will have guaranteed access to high quality, high speed broadband similar to more densely populated areas of Ireland. The network we wish to see built will therefore have to be scalable and capable of meeting future anticipated traffic growth. Whatever the technology used, it must ensure users have a service of at least 30Mbps.<br\/><br\/>In line with the EU competition rules, we must observe a policy of technology neutrality. However, the scale of the Government&rsquo;s ambition in regard to the level of service we wish to see available in rural areas, the step change in broadband quality now prescribedby the EU Commission&rsquo;s State Aid guidelines, the exponential growth in demand from consumers, and in particular business, points to the need for a major infrastructure build that must stand the test of time.<br\/><br\/>To ensure end users can benefit from the guaranteed broadband services required, it is likely that a significant fibre build will be required as close to homes and businesses as possible. With additional fibre connectivity all broadband technologies can deliver higher speeds to end users.

The change\u00a0I will be implementing shortly - by commencing section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2014 - is to bring this offence within\u00a0the Fixed Charge Payment System so that persons will have the option of receiving 3 penalty points on payment of the Fixed Charge rather than automatically being required to go to court.  \u00a0<\/p><p>  The RSA has overall responsibility for the operation,\u00a0oversight\u00a0and delivery of the National Car Test, and as such, statistics\u00a0relating to waiting times for any location is a matter for the Authority. I\u00a0have therefore referred this part of the Deputy's question to the\u00a0RSA\u00a0for direct reply.\u00a0 Please advise my Office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.   \u00a0<\/p><p>  Contrary to some recent media reports that there is a backlog of up to three months to book an NCT, I understand from the RSA that, while the demand for tests is currently high,\u00a0there is no such backlog.  \u00a0<\/p><p>  I am advised that\u00a0the vast majority of car owners will receive an NCT appointment within 28 days with the average currently within 2 weeks.\u00a0 I understand that, in order to meet this standard, in some cases, the National Car Testing Service\u00a0holds requests on a waiting list until a suitable slot is found. In the majority of cases, customers are given a slot within the required timescale.  However, if a slot is not found within 28 days, the test should be offered free of charge.<\/p><p>  To further facilitate demand, an NCT may now be\u00a0undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the test due date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate. This system is in place to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires.

","asker":"986","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1352,"content":"<p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Farm Plan Scheme was introduced in 2006, to incentivise farmers to manage Natura 2000 land in a manner that went above and beyond statutory requirements and where such necessary measures were not provided for in the national agri-environment schemes that were available at that time. The scheme effectively trialled agri-environment interventions at a relatively small scale to inform measures that could be taken forward in due course at a larger scale under the Rural Development Programme (RDP).  It was never envisaged that the NPWS farm plan scheme would replace national, co-financed, agri-environment schemes such as REPS, AEOS, or GLAS.<\/p><p>  Farmers were paid upon certification of compliance with an approved NPWS farm plan.  These plans were prepared on the basis of either the cost to the farmer of compliance or on the basis of rates per hectare for specific management in adherence to a prescription. Therefore, in all cases, payments were specific to the farm in question and related to the measure in question, the eligible lands in which the measure was applied and the cost of compliance where this was not covered in a rate per hectare.  In some cases, there was a tiered approach to payments, with a diminishing rate above certain area thresholds. Where rates per hectare were relevant, these varied depending on the habitat or species being planned. Access to the NPWS Farm Plan Scheme was curtailed in April 2010, due to budgetary constraints. <\/p><p>  In general, it is envisaged that future support for farmers within Natura areas should come from the EU co-funded Rural Development Programme, particularly through the new GLAS scheme.  My Department has been working with, and made a number of submissions to, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the Rural Development Programme and the GLAS measures in particular, and has advised on the priority measures for Natura habitats and species.  These priorities were identified in Ireland&rsquo;s Prioritised Action Framework, which was formally published last week. This framework, which has been approved by Government, identifies a range of actions needed to help improve the status of Ireland's habitats and wildlife. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500089#WRHH02300","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":1353,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500089#WRHH02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1354,"qnumday":600,"qnumall":"[45239\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112500089#WRHH02400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will meet with a deputation from the Irish Farmers with Designated Land and this Deputy in relation to the hen harrier special protection areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
