The financial statements of the national debt, prepared by the National Treasury Management Agency, are presented in full as Part 2 of the finance accounts.  The chapters that are the subject of today&rsquo;s meeting were compiled to highlight key aggregates and trends in Central Fund transactions and broader State liabilities, as well as overall financial transactions between Ireland and the European Union.<\/p><p>  Chapter 1 summarises the Exchequer&rsquo;s financial outturn for 2011, when Central Fund issues exceeded receipts by &euro;25 billion.  About &euro;11 billion of the deficit was due to payments made in 2011 in respect of bank recapitalisation and promissory note payments.<\/p><p>  Chapter 2 sets out trends in the general government debt since 2007, when it stood at around &euro;47 billion.  The debt has risen sharply since then, reaching &euro;169 billion by the end of 2011.  Official general government debt figures for 2012 are not yet available from the Central Statistics Office, but the Department of Finance, as part of its projections for budget 2013, estimated that it would be around &euro;192 billion or 118% of GDP at the end of December 2012.<\/p><p>  General government debt at the end of 2011 included the promissory notes issued by the Minister for Finance to IBRC and the Educational Building Society as part of the process of bank recapitalisation.  These were not included in the NTMA&rsquo;s financial statements of the national debt, and are disclosed only in a footnote on page 24 of the 2011 finance accounts.<\/p><p>  IBRC had used the promissory notes it received as collateral for borrowing from the Central Bank.  When the special liquidator was appointed to IBRC last month, the Central Bank became the owner of the outstanding promissory notes, to the value of &euro;25 billion.  Government bonds with a floating interest rate and an average maturity of 35 years were issued to discharge the liability under the promissory notes, thus adding &euro;25 billion to the national debt.  Because this was an effective reclassification, the overall general government debt balance was not affected by the refinancing.<\/p><p>  The general government debt was the main liability of the State at the end of 2011, but there were other significant State liabilities that are not accounted for in the finance accounts.  There are very substantial State liabilities arising from the future pension entitlements of public servants, relating to their past employment, but no estimate was made of that liability at the end of December 2011.  The last available estimate, presented in a previous report, was an amount of &euro;116 billion as at the end of 2009.  Since that estimate was made, there have been significant changes in public service pay and pension entitlements.  In addition, there may need to be revisions in the key assumptions underpinning the estimate, particularly in regard to projected future salary increases and the rate used to discount future estimated payments.  These could have a significant impact on the estimate of the liability.  I have recommended that actuarial reviews should be carried out at regular intervals to ensure that the State is aware of the long-term cost impact of public service pensions and the timing of outflows.<\/p><p>  Future commitments under public private partnership contracts in place at the end of 2011 were estimated at &euro;4 billion.  The cost implications of these contractual commitments has been dealt with by the committee on a number of occasions.  In my view, those financial commitments should formally be recognised in the finance accounts.<\/p><p>  The purpose of chapter 3 is to provide a further update of the costs to the State of the range of banking and insurance measures implemented in relation to the ongoing crisis in the financial sector.  The measures taken affect a number of sets of financial statements, and do not all impact on the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  As a result, their full financial impacts can be difficult to ascertain.  While the chapter contains information up to around mid-2012, the financial position is evolving.  The Accounting Officer will be able to give a more up-to-date position on the cost of the bank guarantee, liquidity support for banks, recapitalisation and other restructuring measures.<\/p><p>  By mid-2012, the State had made an investment of just over &euro;65 billion in three financial institutions in which it had acquired full or almost full ownership - Allied Irish Bank, Permanent TSB and IBRC &ndash; and in Bank of Ireland, in which it has a minority interest.  The adequacy of the funding injected by the State to meet the capital requirements of the banks that are still trading depends on the net losses they incur in the period 2011 to 2013 not exceeding those projected by the Central Bank.  While no timeframe has been set for the State&rsquo;s withdrawal from its ownership of the banks, there is a prospect that the State may in time recover some of its capital investment.  The State&rsquo;s residual value in IBRC, if any, will depend on the amounts realised from the disposal of IBRC&rsquo;s assets.<\/p><p>  Ultimately, the objectives of the banking stabilisation measures are to return banks to sustainable levels of profitability and to ensure that normal access to credit is restored for business, especially small and medium enterprises.  Chapter 3 reports that AIB and Bank of Ireland have been meeting the lending targets set as a requirement of their recapitalisation by the State.  At the same time, reviews of credit availability for small and medium enterprises suggest that normal access to credit had not been restored.  In that light, the usefulness of setting performance targets for the banks in terms of gross lending to SMEs may be limited.  <\/p><p>  The insurance compensation fund, which operates under the control of the President of the High Court, was set up to meet liabilities of insolvent insurers.  A significant additional funding requirement for the Exchequer arises from the administration of Quinn Insurance Limited, which has a requirement for funding currently projected at up to &euro;1.65 billion.  Related payments out of the Central Fund commenced in late 2011.  Up to the end of June 2012, the Minister for Finance had advanced a total of just under &euro;730 million to the insurance compensation fund to allow it to meet its obligations in relation to QIL.  Receipts from a levy on insurance sales will ultimately be available to repay the Exchequer, but substantial additional advances from the Central Fund are likely to be required in the short to medium term.<\/p><p>  Chapter 5 was compiled to bring together information on financial transactions between Ireland and the EU.  The finance accounts reflect most of the payments to the EU, but substantial receipts from the EU do not pass through the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  In 2011, Ireland continued to be a net beneficiary of EU funding, with contributions of &euro;1.4 billion and receipts totalling &euro;1.9 billion.  Direct payments of &euro;1.3 billion under the European agriculture guarantee fund accounted for around two thirds of the EU receipts.<\/p><p>  The finance accounts are primarily a cash-based record of receipts and issues from the Central Fund and of borrowing undertaken by the NTMA on behalf of the State.  Certain supplementary information is provided on State shareholdings in commercial bodies, Exchequer loan transactions and guarantees.  While the finance accounts comply with the form specified by the Minister for Finance, there is scope for a more complete and transparent account of the financial transactions of central government and of the State&rsquo;s financial position at year-end.  I recommended in my report that the Department should review the level and quality of disclosure in the finance accounts so as to increase the transparency of public financial information.  I understand that the Department is making a number of changes for the 2012 accounts.  In addition, a broad-ranging review of Irish fiscal reporting is under way.  The Accounting Officer will be able to provide details about those developments.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013030700004#C01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1362651600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Yesterday was the first anniversary of my appointment as Secretary General.  It has certainly been a busy first year, but I had expected that.  Members are probably aware that one of our early initiatives was to revise the statement of strategy that we inherited when the new management team took over.  Its aim was to place a much greater focus on our objectives, namely, economic stability, growth and job creation.  We set out five goals on which to focus our work.  The first was the economy, the second was sound public finances, the third was improved living standards for all citizens, the fourth was a return to market funding and the fifth was a more secure and effective banking system.  We also conducted a review and set out many ways in which we were going to change the way in which the Department operates.<\/p><p>  Looking back at 2012, starting with the economy, we know that economic growth and a recovery in employment are crucial preconditions for a sustained improvement in living standards.  Domestic demand is still constrained, as households and firms work off imbalances built up during the boom.  Our job is far from complete.  The unemployment rate remains at an unacceptably high level - 14.1% in February.  While the household debt-to-income ratio fell to its lowest level since early 2007 in the third quarter of 2012, it is still at a high rate of 204%.<\/p><p>  Not surprisingly, our 2013 programme reflects our continued focus on the steps necessary to work through those problems and in addition to focus in particular on ways to facilitate the recovery of the SME sector.  This sector is key in order to achieve real reductions in the unemployment rate.<\/p><p>  The challenges are significant but in facing these challenges, it is important to remember how different this country is from an economic perspective than it was only 12 months ago.  We have now completed over 190 of the programme tasks, drawn down 83% of the funding under the troika programme and are working towards being the first euro area country to exit from a programme of financial support.<\/p><p>  Anglo Irish Bank, the Irish Nationwide Building Society, the promissory notes and the bank guarantee are now all historical parts of the banking sector rescue.  We have sold Irish Life back into private hands and traded &euro;1 billion of the contingent capital we put into Bank of Ireland, both at a profit to the State.  Central Bank support, which was a key part of the restoration of stability for the Government-supported banking sector, is down a further 28% year on year and stood at only &euro;48.1 billion in Jan 2013.  Following a return to growth in 2011, the Irish economy looks to have recorded a second successive year of growth - 0.9% in 2012 - contrasting with a contraction of 0.5% in the euro area.  The composite purchasing managers index remains in expansionary territory and puts us, in effect, with Germany in a club that is showing growth in the area.<\/p><p>  Recent Commission forecasts estimate that unit labour costs will have improved by 23% relative to the euro area over the period from 2008 to 2014, underlining the flexibility of the Irish workforce.  Having increased in the third quarter for the first time since early 2008, the fall in domestic demand is showing signs of having bottomed out, with core retail sales having increased in each of the last six months and VAT receipts positive in the first two months of the year.<\/p><p>  The level of exports is now well above that of the pre-crisis period, having increased by 3.2% over the first three quarters of 2012 to stand at a significant 106% of GDP.  In the context of exports, the services export sector is particularly strong, having grown by 9.4% over the first three quarters in 2012.  The current account of balance of payments has shown surpluses of over &euro;3 billion in each of the last two recorded quarters.  In 2012, taxes on a headline basis were up 7.7% year on year.  All of that has contributed to a further reduction in the deficit.  We expect a deficit of less than 8% for 2012, which is again significantly below the troika target of 8.6% for the year.<\/p><p>  I understand that the fiscal adjustments are painful in many cases.  They are, however, essential to the restoration of growth in the economy, our ability to go it alone after the end of the programme in December, and to the restoration of international confidence in the economy, which will be reflected in further investment and jobs.  We are a very open economy.  I have mentioned the size of GDP and our exports, and we are very dependent on the continued recovery in the performance of other large trading blocs.<\/p><p>  In the last 12 months, we are however seeing strong external validation of the strategy.  The IDA had a record year in 2012 and, most encouragingly, signs of stabilisation in the labour market finally emerged.  Ireland is back in the markets, issuing conventional bonds of &euro;4.2 billion, a further &euro;1 billion of amortising bonds, short-term treasury bonds of &euro;1 billion and bond switches of &euro;4.5 billion.  There has been with a dramatic fall in interest rate costs for the country as confidence in Ireland improved over 12 months.  Treasury bill costs have dropped dramatically to between 20 and 25 basis points, compared with the first issuance in August 2012 at 1.8%.  Our two and eight year spreads are now at 1.07% and 3.74%.  It is worth recalling that only 20 months ago, these were at 22.4% and 15%.  It is also worth noting in terms of the importance of this that with a stock of debt approaching &euro;200 billion, even a 1% movement or reduction in interest rate costs can very dramatically improve the interest costs of our budgetary numbers.<\/p><p>  In the past 12 months we are also seeing growing levels of investment in many sectors of the economy, particularly from outside, including commercial property.  All told, &euro;10 billion has been invested or committed in the past six months, mainly by international investors in transactions managed by the State or entities controlled by the State.<\/p><p>  I mentioned at the outset in terms of our statement of strategy that we set out over the past 12 months to play our part in all of the events mentioned but in parallel to embark on a significant change agenda in the operation of the Department.  More detail is contained in our review of 2012 which will be published later today.  In brief, we have implemented a complete restructuring of the Department into four key policy areas, and two support office areas - a finance area and a corporate support office.  We have restructured the operation of our management advisory committee, which now focuses more on business planning and objective delivery and on challenge sessions on key policy areas.  We have an enhanced risk and control environment, including the creation of a chief risk officer position, which reports directly to me, and the implementation of a risk committee and a radically different approach to audit committee and internal audit support.<\/p><p>  Along the way we have also tried to extract significant costs savings of approximately &euro;750,000 through the reorganisation of accommodation, resulting in a reduced premises footprint, and through other initiatives from our colleagues in Tullamore, which is a shared services office, who have embarked on various reform measures such as the elimination of payable orders and the reduction in frequency of issuing payslips.  Indeed, overall in 2012, we delivered our programme with approximately &euro;7 million savings against budget, including by the deferral of costs where possible.<\/p><p>  One of the other hallmarks of 2012 in terms of the change in the way the Department has operated has been a much greater openness.  We have had much more frequent public speaking and media engagements, greater interaction with the wider public sector and the private sector, as well as the secondment of a number of specialised resources into the Department to assist with various tasks.  We have also deepened our links with other Departments and State agencies in 2012 and have availed of resources from a number of them.<\/p><p>  We are very proud of our achievements, but as I noted earlier, there is still much to do.  We remain committed to that task.  I have noticed especially of late a welcome growing appreciation of the effectiveness of the public sector and its contribution to the higher profile deliveries I have outlined above.  I put on record my gratitude to the staff in the Department for their continuing help and support.  I would particularly like to record the efforts of the unsung heroes who behind the scenes somehow make it all possible.  Whether it is managing the legislative process, answering parliamentary questions, dealing with the scheduling of stakeholder visits, organising foreign trips, preparing strategic briefings, ensuring the preparation of financial accounts or payments across the system, printing material often at the last minute and late into the night or just keeping the offices and IT systems open and working well, all of those and other things are essential to the functioning of the Department and the delivery of the objectives we have set ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013030700005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362652200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>May we publish Mr. Moran's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013030700006#E00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362652200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013030700006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1362652200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Mr. Moran and his team are welcome to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I want to begin by echoing Mr. Moran's words of thanks to what he aptly described as the many unsung heroes in his Department.  We all got some insight during the passage of legislation here recently, and during various efforts at a European level, of the amount of work being undertaken at a political level but also at an official level in his Department.  Those to the fore in political life tend to get credit for that, and it is important to acknowledge the role played by a number of Mr. Moran's staff.  The Taoiseach did that in the D&aacute;il in recent weeks and I want to echo it today.<\/p><p>  Happy anniversary to Mr. Moran on his first year in the job.  He had a very busy year, and that is evident from his opening statement.<\/p><p>  I want to hone in on some issues that have arisen from the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports, Mr. Moran's own statement of strategy, and other issues of public discourse.  I will structure my questioning around six areas, first, the European situation with regard to our own debt; second, the banking division within the Department of Finance; third, the issue of bankers' pay and the ongoing Mercer's report; fourth, Mr. Moran's new revised statement of strategy to which he referred in his opening statement; fifth, the issue of IBRC; and, sixth, the ending of the bank guarantee scheme at the end of this month.  I will put questions back and forth to Mr. Moran if he is agreeable to that.<\/p><p>  On the situation at a European level, the promissory note was one stage, which I suppose is now dealt with.  We have heard in the media, and comments from the Minister for Finance this week, about the ongoing efforts to postpone the repayment of the &euro;40 billion bailout loans this country has received.  Could Mr. Moran bring us up to date on the position with regard to that?  Also, will he give the committee some level of detail on what the Minister referred to as options 1 to 5?  The Minister said in media comments during the week that option 1 would be of very little benefit to the country whereas option 5 would be of massive benefit to the Exchequer.  Mr. Moran might bring us up to speed on that, and also give the committee an overview of the difference we could see with regard to debt sustainability, depending on whether we get option 1, 5 or 3.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013030700006#E00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362652200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>To put matters in context, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has explained that over the course of this year it needs to raise about &euro;6 billion additional market funding.  That will allow us to have funded the operation of the State to the end of 2014.  We believe that is perfectly achievable in the current markets, but that is a very important platform from which to build an exit programme for the State after the end of the year when we will have drawn down all of the troika programme funding.<\/p><p>  We then need to work with it in terms of the remaining profile of our debt because, obviously, when we have a repayment obligation coming up we must either go to the market or find an alternative way to source it.  The repayment of the debt from the perspective of the State on the troika programme begins to start to bite at that stage.  The idea is that if we can find ways in which we can defer the repayment obligations on those debts into the future, it allows us to have a lot less pressure in terms of the repayment obligations and, in effect, the markets respond to that.<\/p><p>  The options 1 to 5 to which the Deputy referred are in effect a range of dates into the future in which we can do it.  It has been explained that some of the options would involve pushing out the debt to a very forward date into the future, and others would involve simply dealing with some of what we call the peaks and troughs in the profile so that we would flatten them out.  That would mean that in each of the years coming up over, say, the next ten years, the amount the NTMA would have to borrow from the markets would become a broadly level payment during the course of the years.  Mr. Jim O'Brien is much more closely involved in it in terms of the European meetings, but the ability to say what that will mean for the budgetary process going forward is a little premature at this stage because in terms of what is happening in Europe, they are trying to examine a solution which would alleviate the repayment schedule for the Irish date and to do the same for the Portuguese debt at the same time.  It is not possible for us to give any indication of what will happen.<\/p><p>  More importantly, what is very difficult to do, and we saw that in the context of the IBRC situation as well, is to find a way of calculating the benefit for the State in respect of those because a number of different elements are at play.  First, will the extension continue at the existing interest rates but to the extent it requires reissuance of debt by the Europeans to allow us to continue the funding longer?  We will then be subject to market conditions at that time if the extension is the interest rate the Irish State would pay.<\/p><p>  The other aspect that is very difficult is that the best way to describe the benefit of any of this, apart from the obvious market benefit of easing the repayment obligations, which is reflected in lower Government bond rates, is that we look at what we would have paid and compare it to the new interest rate.  As we saw in the context of the IBRC, had we done that two days before the IBRC announcements we would have created a sense of a much greater benefit than if we did it two days later because the mere announcement of the deferral brought the interest rates on the Irish Government bonds down about 50 basis points.  In some sense we could say there was less benefit in that transaction three days later, but it was actually the transaction that created the benefit.  The maturities discussions that are ongoing are doing the same thing.  Depending on the actual result of deferral, the amount of deferral and the interest rates, it could have an impact of a different magnitude on the Irish Government debt rates and, therefore, would change our budgetary process of itself.  Mr. O'Brien might want to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013030700006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362652200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Mr. Moran has said a great deal in explaining the background, but a statement was issued by Ministers last Tuesday after they met in Brussels and in that statement it moved the process on to say that the work that has been advanced should continue.  The Ministers agreed that we should consider the possibility of the adjustment of maturities, which is a positive move.  It is not a decision just yet, and they will come back to it for both Ireland and Portugal.  They agreed also to ask the troika to build on the work already begun at senior official level and to bring forward the best options for both countries.  There is still a good deal of work to be done but as Mr. Moran said, the main point is to look at the peaks and troughs in terms of the maturity of the debt facing us in the years ahead.  It would be very helpful, in terms of an exit strategy as part of a broader package of measures, to ease that out, which will give confidence to the private sector to invest as well.  The options are not fully worked out yet but they range from a very short extension of maturities out to a much larger range of maturities.  Obviously, from our point of view we would like to have a reasonably large extension on maturities so that there is confidence and a sustainable and durable exit from the programme underpinned by that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013030700006#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1362652200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran and Mr. O'Brien.

Our role is effectively as shareholder in the banks.  The particular relationship with the banks is set out in a relationship framework which we put in place at the beginning of last year &ndash; in March, I believe.  The frameworks, which are publicly available on our website, set out the negotiated position with the troika.  The troika had views on this, as did the Department and bank management.  We set out a level of engagement for involvement in the operation of the banks.  In the case of remuneration, we have a different level of engagement than in respect of individual lending decisions, for example.  The arrangements are designed to insulate the banks, which should be commercial operations, from any individual interference in respect of loans.  If there are circumstances where people want to know what is happening in respect of a particular loan, it is not a role in which the Department should have a part.  Our primary function as a shareholder is in respect of the appointment of the board.  The board and management of the banks should, therefore, run the banks.  What happens is that we have management meetings.  I believe I outlined this at some stage, perhaps at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.

I understand that when one joins the board, one becomes part of the board.  It is very difficult, however, to find a tangible example of how public interest directors are making a difference and acting in the public interest in a way that any other director is not.   It was suggested that public interest directors should be acting differently or keeping an extra eye out for the public.  I remain to be convinced that this is happening.  In saying this, I mean no disrespect to the individuals concerned because I am not sure the structures allow for what I am suggesting.

All directors have an obligation to the company and to keep an eye on the shareholders' interests.  At times, there is a conflict between what people might think is in the public interest and what is in the interest of the shareholder.  Again, this is a further complexity because people might say it is in the public's interest to have very cheap loans made available or very high interest rates.  Those who are benefiting from them across the economy may believe there is an advantage but it is very much anathema to the interest of the shareholder, whose interest is to see banks become profitable.  From the summer of last year, as we became more aware from the discussions with the regulators of the lack of progress of the banks, we have had much more engagement with all the directors.  We have asked public interest directors to focus particularly on lending to SMEs, for example, and mortgage arrears resolutions.

There have been some changes and I think it has been suggested or may already be the case that I am supposed to spend at least two years not working in any sort of conflict situation after leaving my position.  These rules apply to the civil servants in there.  I believe John Corrigan spoke at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform about the review he is conducting regarding the people he has in his area.  We have started to think about whether anything specific to that situation is necessary given the nature of our position and, for example, have asked our colleagues in the United Kingdom how they handle these issues.  However, while one can focus on the conflict that exists in the banking unit as a particular one that has focus, in some respects the same conflicts apply in almost everything we do as people who look at the economy, in that one could say such a conflict arises if someone leaves our Department to go into work in a professional firm.  This is a new issue for the Civil Service to grapple with because we have started to encourage people to come into the Civil Service from outside, as opposed to previously, when that was less frequent.  As a consequence and as we go through the situation, we also will see more people leaving.

Consequently, if in fact there are dichotomies of pay between the State-owned banks and those in the broader banking or financial services sectors, this issue must be considered.  On the other hand, we have banks that have not yet returned to profitability and, therefore, this also must be taken into account when the management of the banks consider the road to profitability - towards which we encourage them to go - to make sure they are, in effect, treating the compensation issue with that backdrop against the situation.

However, the third goal refers to an improvement in the living standards of our citizens and to a fair resolution of the problems of excess debt of citizens.  Obviously, this is a strategy for the period up to 2014 and I struggle to meet many of my constituents who believe they have had or expect in that period of time to have an improved standard of living.  The nub of this issue is that, as Mr. Moran quite correctly noted in the statement, it is linked to the need for the fair resolution of the problem of excess debt.  The Department's strategy goes on to discuss two areas, namely, distressed mortgages and sustainable levels of personal and mortgage debt.  First, how many distressed mortgages are there?  For the purposes of clarity, the Secretary General should outline the definition of a distressed mortgage.

The second bucket refers to people who are in the greater than 90 day category, which in effect reflects an inability or unwillingness to repay the mortgage over a period of longer than three months, which suggests a growing and more serious problem.

The risk is that if somebody stays in arrears for too long, without having it dealt with, in effect the problem gets worse rather than better.  Therefore we have encouraged them to try to work particularly hard on the zero to 90 day bucket, so that we can see an effective reduction there, which stems the flow of significant new mortgages getting into arrears problems.  In doing so, it will more actively - than was the case beforehand - focus on the financial statements that come in from customers to understand those customers who are genuinely able to pay their mortgages, and should be doing so, but are taking advantage of the hiatus.  There are also those who are suffering a temporary shock to their system, for example, a loss of employment of one or both members of the household, which means that one has to find a temporary solution pending their resumption of employment.  In addition, there are those who have much more deeply embedded problems.

I am linking into the mortgage issue.  The context is that during the period from 2003 onwards, particularly from 2006 and 2007 onwards, ordinary people were given mortgages by banks that they could not afford.  We have now found that many of them were in jobs that were unsustainable and built on a property bubble and the banks were doling out money.  Bank of Ireland were giving out 100% mortgages in 2006.  If one looks at the rate of arrears, one will see that it is far more acute in that cohort.  Mr. Moran referred to when the amount of sustainable mortgage for an individual mortgage holder is less than the value of the home.  I would probably look at it from a slightly different perspective.  The banks got us into this mess, not the mortgage holders or the ordinary punter.  The banks need to find creative ways to make mortgages sustainable.  By that, I mean they should be looking at 40-year mortgages and every conceivable possibility.  I accept that they will be voluntary situations but there is a moral and financial onus on the banks.  I feel strongly on this issue because the banks have repeatedly appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and I have seen them coming in from as early as 2007.  The banks have a responsibility here and must find every possible solution to get to a point where mortgages are sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013030700014#N03200","speaker":"1060","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362657600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I agree fully with Deputy O'Donnell that the onus is on banks to use all efforts to find the right solution for customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013030700015#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1362657600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>This is against the backdrop that in a great many cases, mortgages were provided by banks which had become like betting shops.

The problem here is that it is not good enough for banks to now come along and say that normal commercial criteria must resume.  In many cases, the banks put people in the position of having mortgages they cannot now afford.  It is not good enough for banks to walk away from this.

It is absolutely a key part of the resolution that banks engage and find all the solutions they can to allow people to stay in their houses if it makes sense for those people to be in those houses.  This is where I mentioned earlier the concept of what is a sustainable mortgage and the key relationship between the maximum amount of the sustainable mortgage and the value of the house.  It is not in anybody's interests to see the banks kicking the can down the road in respect of people but there are numerous scenarios in which, for example, interest only may be the right solution for people, particularly if in the future one can imagine a scenario in which those people will find themselves with more disposable income to pay a larger mortgage and to start to pay back the value of the mortgage.  The obvious example is where two people were working and one lost his or her job.  It is conceivable that the second person will come back into employment and the household income will increase to a point where the repayment of the principal may be possible.  If we are in a scenario where people cannot even afford to pay the interest portion of the mortgage payment, given that rates are currently at particularly low levels, the appropriate solution, which must be looked at on a case-by-case basis, may not include kicking this out to the future but to resolve it now to ensure that the weight of the excess debt is no longer on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013030700015#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1362657600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>This cannot be a licence for the banks to engage in wholesale repossessions.

The Irish public places enormous store in the family home.  It is probably a throwback to our history.  It occupies a position in Irish society that can never be underestimated.  The banks must play their part.  Banks will be banks so it is down to regulation and direction.  Where two similar cases land on a banker's desk, different results can follow.

They have a loss built in.  It is not necessarily appropriate that banks use taxpayers' money to subsidise people who are living in accommodation - even if it is a family home - that is beyond their means.  There are many people who do not fall into that category who need assistance whether it is from the State or the bank.  However, there is a balance to be drawn here, which is quite delicate, in terms of deciding the scenarios in which an individual or family should continue to live in a particular house as opposed to any house.  It is the extent to which that is a standard of living that they are reasonably and fairly capable of supporting themselves or whether it requires taxpayers' assistance to do that in the form of mortgage interest supplement or rent allowance or other provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013030700015#O00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1362657600,"counter":378,"content":"<p>My point is that a 20 year mortgage might be sustainable over a 40 year period.

To prevent the risk that might otherwise arise in a liquidation as complicated as this of people perceiving this as a fire sale and therefore bidding very low for the assets we have put in place a structure whereby in effect NAMA's participation in the process will set a floor on the value.  Only if people are prepared to bid more than the value that NAMA sees in the assets by winding them down or running them off over a longer period will the liquidator in effect sell them to third parties.  Once they move to NAMA the process will continue and it may be at that stage that the realisation of the best value for the taxpayer may include a subsequent sale by NAMA of the assets.  The importance of NAMA's participation is to prevent the perceived notion of a liquidation as a forced sale with values therefore at rock bottom and a buyer descending on it.

The Deputy gave the correct number on those overturned but what is disappointing to us when we look at the process is how few people go to our Credit Review Office, which has a success rate of more than 50%.  Low credit is a key economic issue.  We are conducting a review to understand how to improve the Credit Review Office, but such an office has been established and has a success rate of approximately 50%.  We do not understand why 97% of people who are refused credit do not use the Credit Review Office.  I am concerned about drawing too many conclusions with respect to the numbers mentioned by the Deputy because they represent such a small sample of the total process.  Part of the work we are doing with the small and medium enterprise funding body is to try to understand certain parts of the chain in particular.

Recently, we issued a paper on the Credit Review Office.  We conducted a review on these issues because it seems to work well in some scenarios and allows credit to work.  In many cases the process of overturning the bank's decision involves the borrower assisting the Credit Review Office with regard to the strength of the business plan or the documentation supplied.  It is not necessarily a problem with the bank process; it can often be a problem with the application.  This does not concern me in the sense that what is important is that we find a solution for the business to get credit.  If the Credit Review Office is able to help in this process the question becomes why more people do not use this resource.  We have suggested that perhaps we can do something at the point at which an application is declined to increase awareness of the credit review process and perhaps remove the internal appeal so one can go directly to the Credit Review Office.  We can imagine borrowers who might decide that as they have tried it once with the bank there is no point to an internal review.  We could allow such people go directly to the Credit Review Office and ensure this option is highlighted well in any communication.

A mortgage is not an optional debt which allows people to continue paying unsecured debt without paying the mortgage.  In deciding what is a sustainable mortgage for a customer, unsecured creditors should be required to participate in effecting the resolution of the debt because the priority should be given to the secured creditor, which is the bank with the mortgage.  We have seen this blockage in the system and recently the Central Bank stated it plans to engage with banks, credit unions and other unsecured creditors with regard to dealing in a streamlined way with a borrower who has unsecured debt from credit cards or credit unions.

These banks are wholly or partially owned by the State.  The public ask me what influence the Government has with them over increases in SVRs if the issues of arrears and repossessions - Mr. Moran mentioned these - that see terminally ill people dragged from their homes are so important to it.<\/p><p>  Some might say that people should get fixed rates, but they cannot afford them.  If one is on 4% or 4.25% now when it used to be 3.5% or 3.25%, one would be lucky to get a fixed rate of 5.5%.  People cannot afford this and, according to the CEOs of both banks, are stuck facing increases in SVRs.

This would feed into the banks' ability to borrow money more cheaply.  On page 37 of the annual review document that we produced this morning, there is a clear illustration of the correlation between the cost of funds for banks and the cost of funds for the State.

The definition in this regard as per the Bill is \"a building constructed in the period 1714-1830 for use as a dwelling and comprising at least two storeys, with or without basement\".  I refer, for example, to Waterford Civic Trust.  My inclination which was backed up was that the footprint of Georgian buildings in the centre of Waterford would not come within this definition.  Many of them were built in the period 1830 to mid-1840 in a style of Georgian architecture.  The difficulty is that if the definition is adhered to tightly, there will be no impact on Georgian Waterford.  I was sent a copy of the submission made by the Irish Georgian Society on the issue which supports my argument.  It refers to Limerick, in particular, where there is a large proportion of Georgian houses dating back to the 1840s and 1850s.  The definition will need to be looked at again if the provision is to have a real impact.<\/p><p>  I have spoken to people who are knowledgeable in this regard.  Their view is that the cut-off date should not be 1830 as Georgian style houses were built well into the 1840s.  When I first raised this issue, it generated some mirth and I was given a lecture on history.  However, it is an important point if the living city initiative is to have any impact.  It is a good idea and badly needed in the residential and retail sector of the city.

Banks are in the business of providing credit to companies but are not necessarily in the business of providing capital.  One of the focuses in the past year in this respect has been how we can work on the provision of alternative balance sheet repair mechanisms to banks.  I mentioned earlier the categorisation we have of the three types of companies, with micro-companies on one side, exporting and good companies on another and the companies in trouble on the final side.  We have been working with the folks in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, with close to &euro;1 billion now provided in respect of three types of funds, with one targeted at the issue of restructuring medium to large companies' balance sheets.  When that feeds through the system, there will be greater flexibility in people's borrowing choices and the ability to take funding from the system.<\/p><p>  We will still be faced with a problem that we did not have in the past that must be addressed and we have identified it as in need of attention.  We are a very open economy that is significantly dependent on the ability of companies to export.  Nevertheless, our banking system has, in effect, gone in the opposite direction.  As European banking systems going through the resolution of the banking crisis have become national rather than international, our banks have been put in that position as well.  We need more mechanisms and are working to try to provide supports so that banks can either be teamed with external banks in markets to which our companies wish to export or, alternatively, that banks in those jurisdictions are encouraged to have operations in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The members mentioned some of the elements we intend to use to break through these issues.  A group meets every two weeks, which involves people from Enterprise Ireland, our colleagues in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Education and Skills, which has an important role to play in teaching the managers of companies how to run businesses.  Other State-based stakeholders, including the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, are also involved in trying to drive all these various initiatives.<\/p><p>  We have also taken advantage of a programme we are running in the Department where we bring in people from other treasuries to work with us on the international area.

We must bear in mind that there is already a deposit guarantee system in place of up to &euro;100,000.  Therefore, our next focus in terms of continuing to break the link between the two will be to try to reduce, as we started earlier this year, the investment that the State has in the banks.

We have an agenda that includes not just mortgage arrears but also lending and SMEs.  We raise it at the level of the boards to ensure that they are putting as much pressure as they can on the banks.  We also do that indirectly by virtue of the fact that we want and insist that the banks should move towards profitability.  The banks understand that the only way they can become profitable is by lending money.  There is no point in not doing any sales, in terms of loans, as they will not be able to generate any profits.  I mentioned earlier the shared frustration on the mortgage arrears.  Equally, in this area we continue to try and figure out what we can do with this.  We are not the only treasury struggling with this.  We have hosted conferences with people across Europe to try and understand if they have any tricks or techniques that we are not using here.<\/p><p>  We have an SME funding group which involves people from across the system to ensure there is a whole-of-government approach to this.  It meets every two weeks in my Department.  We have a stakeholders group where we bring in the banks, all of the participants and the representative bodies for these various companies in the tourism sector, SME sector and everything else.  I have almost threatened to start publishing the minutes of that meeting so people can understand where we are going.  We send out consultation papers to see if there is anything else we could do, and we do not necessarily hear all the solutions, even from the industry bodies, as to what more we could be doing in this sector.<\/p><p>  The banks have come from a position where they have not been well positioned to do this lending.  Certainly, two years ago the banks were in much worse shape than they are today.  The difficulty we still face in respect of a lot of companies we talk about is a more complex issue about high rents, overhang of debt and balance sheets that in many respects are also lacking enough equity for banks to be able to make loans.  That is not to say there are not still issues in the banks.  The fact that we engage with the Credit Review Office as much we do on situations shows that.  When we get a customer who has had a problem with a bank where it is not appropriate for us to intervene in respect of that customer, we can pass it on to the Credit Review Office.  Even in scenarios where it is not statutorily entitled to engage, because, for example, the loan is above its limit, it has assisted us by then engaging with the banks to try to understand the situation.  In some cases that has also resulted in solutions.  In other cases it has resulted in an analysis which says the bank's decision was right.<\/p><p>  I believe there is a complexity to this discussion.  The funds we have introduced with the NPRF should add very welcome and necessary equity type funding into the balance sheets, so we can try and work out the more important employers.  We still have the scenario I mentioned earlier of smaller companies not necessarily running themselves as well as they should to get loans, and their situations are tougher.  However, we have scenarios that we cannot understand.  We have a micro-finance fund with almost no applications.  That is very strange in the context of what we are hearing about small companies not being able to access funding.  There are perhaps 100 or 200 applications to the micro-finance fund.  We were initially worried that we would be inundated with applications but we are not getting any.  AIB issued a new product at the end of last year where up to &euro;25,000 of lending is available to existing customers with a 24 hour time approval.  Again, there is just a handful of applications.  Therefore, there is also a serious issue with demand.  It could be that the demand has been weakened by people's belief that banks are not lending.  Banks want to lend.  Whether they are well equipped to do it or not, I do not know, but it is important that this message is conveyed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013030700023#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1362662400,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I believe the business sector got that message.  My concern is that having received the message, the business examines its state of affairs to prepare for a bank loan.  What is not being acknowledged by the bank is the historical debt that is there.  A business might have diverted from its core activity.  I am talking about family owned businesses, single entrepreneurs and so forth.  They might have bought another property and the property might not be performing, so it is hindering the growth of the core business.  The bank is not dealing with that.  It is simply allowing a business to struggle on.  A business might be sustained on that basis for two years or more but it is not possible or feasible in the long term, and the banks do not address that.  My issue is, and this was said by Enterprise Ireland with regard to another sector, that the banks do not appear to understand the new tools that are necessary to deal with the business problems that exist.

It is good to have this opportunity to be present.<\/p><p>  When we speak of the European Union, we should speak of optimism, not pessimism, as we mark our 40 years of EU membership.  It is a difficult time for many people in Ireland who are being left behind, but it is not a difficult time for everybody.  We need to remind ourselves of that because sometimes we talk ourselves into doom and gloom.  The rest of us can do something to assist those who are having difficulty.<\/p><p>  In the few minutes I have, I want to speak a little about solidarity within Ireland, the European Union and further afield.  In spite of the economic crisis, the European Union has been a great success.  After nearly 70 years of peace and when Croatia joins in July, the Union will have 28 members, with a number of other states seeking to join.  For some of my fellow MEPs from the former Soviet bloc, this is nothing short of a miracle.<\/p><p>  Since 1973, Ireland has always been at the heart of the European project.  This January we commenced our seventh Presidency of the European Union in 40 years.  Our country, which was once solely dependent on agriculture and the British market, has grown into a diversified economy, with IT and financial services, agriculture and food, pharmaceuticals and manufacturing.  We have access to 500 million consumers as part of the Single Market.  We have one Commissioner, just like Germany has, and one Minister at the Council of Ministers, as do all the other member states.  The Secretary General of the Commission is Irish, as was the Secretary General before her.  We need to remind ourselves of what life was like before we joined compared with what it is like now.<\/p><p>  At some stage in the future, if we are faced with Britain deciding it wants to have a different relationship with the European Union, I believe we will have decided our die is cast.  The day we joined the European Union was the day we became truly sovereign.  Until then, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer set the interest rate and value of our currency.  We thought our biggest export was agricultural produce but our biggest export was people.  When I first became a Deputy and Member of this House, I was given 1,000 signatures from one parish alone of people who had been waiting for up to five years for a telephone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gay Mitchell, MEP","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362664800,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mitchell, MEP for his presentation.

The first question was about the financial, budgetary and economic policy integration in the EU.  The second was about democratic accountability, legitimacy and political union.<\/p><p>  I contend that a profound change is happening in the European Union without enough discussion, debate or awareness taking place.  As President Barroso stated:<blockquote>What is going on is a silent revolution - a silent revolution in terms of strong economic governance by small steps.  The  member states have accepted - and I hope they understood it exactly - but they have accepted very important powers of the European institutions regarding surveillance, and a much stricter control of public finances.<\/blockquote>In my opinion it is revolution or a counter-revolution that is well under way.  It has already made significant strides in the direction that it wants to go but a lot further remains to be done.  The model it is driving towards can be summed up by the phrase &quot;authoritarian neo-liberalism&quot; which comprises three aspects.  First, the technocratisation of economic policy-making.  That means that economic policy is no longer a matter for political debate between left and right, between neo-liberals and Keynesian socialists.  Instead there is a right and a wrong answer and the right answer happens to be the answer favoured by the Thatcherites and the neo-liberals.  It is an ideological assault that takes place with the raising of economists to high priests and cannot be questioned.<\/p><p>  Second, making neo-liberalism law.  That is what I have seen so far and I shall explain.  It imbeds neo-liberalism in law in the European Union and its member states in national legislation.  At the same time, and in the words of Mr. Martin Callanan, MEP, and leader of the British Conservatives in the European Parliament, it is &quot;making socialism illegal&quot;.  In reality it makes Keynesianism illegal.  It makes significant State expenditure, running deficits, etc., illegal under the rules of the European Union and the process of economic governance.  Third, it involves a significant transfer of power which is real and cannot be disputed.  It is a transfer of power from elected governments to unelected bodies, in particular the European Commission and the European Central Bank.<\/p><p>  One wonders why this is happening.  Is it in response to the crisis?  Is it taking advantage of the crisis?  In my opinion it is both.  It is partly in response to the crisis in the neo-liberalism framework that the political establishments across Europe know.  It is also an example of what Naomi Klein calls a shock doctrine.  That means one uses a shock, in this case it was clearly created by neo-liberal capitalism, to further imbed the policies.  That is what happening.  My slides show two quotes by the two largest business lobbying organisations in Europe, the European Round Table of Industrialists and BUSINESSEUROPE.  In 2002 the European Round Table of Industrialists stated, &quot;[A]t the drafting state, the implications of national budgets and of major national fiscal policy measures [should be] reviewed at the level of the Union&quot;.  That is what has been agreed over the past two years.  This agenda has been pushed by big business in Europe over an extended period.  Given the opportunity of the crisis they have been able to go ahead, push it and have their agenda successfully implemented.  I shall quote BUSINESSEUROPE from spring 2010 which states: &quot;[Eurogroup] will ... have to assume greater responsibility in improving economic governance in the euro area, and put greater emphasis on domestic and competitiveness imbalances, which have proved in most recent developments to be a major source of fiscal instability&quot;.  That is precisely what has been done through the &quot;six pack&quot;, &quot;the two pack&quot; and the fiscal treaty.  They are the changes that are being implemented and they were wished for in advance of the crisis.<\/p><p>  With regard to what has happened so far, one can refer to non-legislative measures.  That is a nice term for what has been happening.  On the other hand, there are legislative measures.<\/p><p>  In terms of non-legislative measures, we have seen, largely without a peep from the established media, the removal of elected governments in Greece and Italy.  We have also had the replacement of governments by bankers for bankers whose mandate does not come from the people of those countries but the markets.  European Central Bank ransom notes have been sent.  For example, Sylvio Berlusconi received one on 5 August 2011 that sought a series of measures that had to be implemented and finished with the ominous line, &quot;We trust that the government will take all the appropriate actions&quot;.  The Italians needed the ECB to buy the bonds on the Monday morning.  If they did not it would result in a collapse and bond prices going through the roof.  The ECB, an unelected and unaccountable institution, held a sword over the Italian Government.  Obviously I completely disagree with the policies of that Italian Government.  We know, even though we do not know the details because we have not seen the letters, that letters were sent to the Irish Government at the end of 2010.  There is also the experience of the troika's supervision.  The troika primarily dictates, even though there is a certain amount of discussion, economic policies to the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland.  I have listed the non-legislative measures so far.<\/p><p>  There has been a series of three legislative measures.  First, the six-pack, which we only heard about in Ireland during the course of the fiscal treaty debate even though it had already happened at that stage.  Second, the fiscal treaty.  Third, the two-pack that will come before the European Parliament next week.  I shall oppose the latter but unfortunately it is likely to be passed overwhelmingly.  The legislative measures have made the Stability and Growth Pact targets binding.  Therefore, the 3% deficit ratio and the 60% debt-to-GDP ratio have been made binding and subject to fines if countries do not meet or head towards those targets.  They have imposed rules in national law of binding force and permanent character about a structural deficit which is new and was not contained in the Stability and Growth Pact of 0.5%, as well as the Stability and Growth Pact targets.  It has introduced a procedure called the excessive deficit procedure, in which 20 countries in the EU are currently involved, which subjects them to a large degree of supervision by the European Commission in particular.  There has been an introduction of a system which has not been discussed at all called the scoreboard system.  This is new and goes beyond the Stability and Growth Pact.

I thank the three MEPs for attending this meeting and sharing their perspective on the current position in Europe, our engagement with Europe and their views in general.<\/p><p>  Mr. Gay Mitchell, MEP, talked a great deal about solidarity.  That is what the Irish people would have seen in the early stages of our engagement with Europe.  However, during this crisis people have seen perhaps a lack of that solidarity, which might be perceived more than real.  That has grown out of the Franco-German alliance that developed during the worst days of the crisis.  That alliance might have been due to the architecture that currently exists and the fact that there was no crisis response mechanism.  It was therefore left to the two larger states to hold the various summits and to try to show leadership in terms of solving the crisis, particularly the banking crisis.  That disenchanted many Irish people.  Even though Ireland was subject much of the time to the outcome of those various summits, it did not appear to be part of the decision making process, notwithstanding its roles both in the background and to the forefront as identified by Mr. Mitchell.  Will Mr. Mitchell discuss how Europe might repair that broken relationship with the people?  Ultimately, if there is a perceived disconnect, there is a disconnect.  I believe it is something we must address.  I am a committed European and have seen the phenomenal benefits we have gained from Europe, so it is disappointing to see that gulf in terms of public opinion.<\/p><p>  Paul Murphy, MEP, and I will always differ in our views on Europe.  That is fine.  As always, he articulates his views and his dislike for what he perceives as a big, bad Europe in a very coherent way.  He succeeded in addressing that clearly.  However, notwithstanding all its faults and frailties, where does he see a better system of administration?  He would have a different viewpoint from probably the majority of people on how Ireland is and has been governed in recent years and on the current agenda.  Will he discuss his perception of the ideal model?  It would give us an opportunity to work on something concrete or a direction which we might consider taking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700006#E00500","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1362666600,"counter":593,"content":"<p>The theme of these discussions is Ireland and the future of the EU.

We need to engage with the community where we live.  Do the MEPs have any engagement with people on the issue of integration in the EU?  What feedback do they get on the EU and its institutions from ordinary people?

Perhaps he might come back to me on that one.<\/p><p>  We should certainly debate the delicate issue of common defence and security policy.  I am delighted Ireland is supporting the training of the Malian army.  We are very proud of the work our soldiers and garda&iacute; do in the international arena.  Rather than concentrate on the common defence and security policy perhaps we should look more closely at home.  While I do not know how it operates throughout Europe, is this the democratic forum that MEPs have to relate back to the constituents?  There seems to be an incredible gap between the work they do in Europe and their relationship with the people on the ground who elect them.  Is this the only step from Europe, down to the national Parliament and down to the people?  Are other formulae in operation elsewhere in Europe that create this democratic legitimacy and accountability we are trying to address?<\/p><p>  In asking us to concentrate on Europe as it is today, there is an argument that there is considerable picking and choosing as things stand today in Europe.

Latvia is applying.  There are 11 countries signing up to the financial transactions tax, which means that many of them are not.  The EU has decided its budget, which is lower than anticipated.  The Euro sceptics in Britain are applauding this as a victory to have reduced spending.  We are talking about optimism and solidarity, which go hand in hand.  Does Britain's decision to have an in-or-out referendum on the EU build the optimism and solidarity that Europe needs at this time?  Do Britain's worrying demands to take more power back from Europe to the national Parliament constitute optimism or solidarity from a British perspective?  Also on the issue of solidarity, Bulgaria and Romania are arguing they should be within the Schengen region and particular partners in Europe will not support them.  Comedians have been elected in Italy.  Some people would suggest that Ireland was the first to elect comedians in the last election.  Regardless of whether that is true, it indicates that people are very sceptical of politicians and political structures.  Again in the context of optimism and solidarity, Catalonia, which is the economic engine of Spain, is considering breaking away - it does not want to have solidarity with the rest of Spain.  We see the economic crisis affecting many countries in Europe - particularly the three countries in bailouts, Portugal Greece and Ireland.<\/p><p>  Is Europe ready to expand if we cannot resolve these existing contradictions within the Union?

I particularly compliment Ms Costello, MEP, and Mr. Mitchell, MEP, on addressing the issues that affect Europe at present - not just one country or one part of the social strata, but all of the people of Europe collectively.  That is critical from the point of view of responsible representation among politicians throughout Europe.  At the level of the European Parliament, at national level and at local authority level it is vital to have people who accept representation with responsibility.<\/p><p>  I have not heard a dissertation in a long time with which I disagreed more profoundly than what I heard from Mr. Murphy, MEP.  That is not a reflection on him but is a reflection on the extent to which he has been misled by misleading propaganda and the extent to which he in turn misled the public throughout this country and continent with particular reference to the European Union.  There have been a number of references to Keynesianism.  I read a little bit about Keynesianism as well.  As I have mentioned previously, my mother lived in the United States in the 1930s and we learned much about its failures and the numerous attempts to revive flagging economies at a particularly difficult time.  It is amazing how some elements in that equation have disappeared over the period and only the most acceptable elements are now being transmitted.  It is unfair to select quotations from people such as President Barroso as a means of emphasising and advancing a political agenda.<\/p><p>  I accept that Europe has many faults at present and we have all been critical of Europe.  Europe's fault has been the inability of member states to move in the one direction at the same time, to act in unison, to support each other in solidarity, and to be helpful and supportive of each other socially, politically and economically.  Europe needs to redefine its vision - something we have discussed many times.  In an economic crisis it is difficult to tell the people the truth.  It is very easy to opt out and to take the easy options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700007#F00500","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362667800,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I join in welcoming the three guests and thank them for attending.  It is important to have this dialogue with them and it is good that the new schedule of meeting times will facilitate this further.<\/p><p>  I wish to pose straightforward questions that I asked the last day.  The Chairman helpfully suggested that I might pose the same questions to the delegation today.  Will the multi-annual financial framework be passed by the European Parliament?  How sizeable is the opposition to the MFF?  I believe it will be passed.  It is great, I am delighted about it and we need it.<\/p><p>  I want Ms Costello to comment on how she thinks the youth guarantee scheme will work in practice.  Does she think it will alleviate the unemployment problem?  It has been very helpful in Finland.  I am optimistic about it but I am interested to hear her opinion.  Does she think that we will get a significant part of the &euro;6 billion fund to assist us in the process?<\/p><p>  I shall now turn to the remarks made by Mr. Murphy.  Does he see his analysis of Europe as being consistent with one getting a youth guarantee scheme and &euro;6 billion devoted to the scheme?  The scheme will give young people opportunities.  Ireland also got a deal on the promissory notes, which is very realistic in an Irish context and alleviates any immediate cashflow problems.  The European Stability Mechanism will also arrange a rebalancing of finances throughout Europe.  The entire European project has meant a significant transfer of resources from within Europe to poorer regions and countries.  Ireland has benefited from a significant transfer of resources, as eastern European countries are benefiting at present.  How does Mr. Murphy reconcile his last thesis suggesting anarchy and disturbances here?  I agree with Deputy Durkan's comments on his thesis.  How does Mr. Murphy reconcile it with the fact that Greece has suffered greatly from the position that it adopted?  Relative to our position, Greece is in a much worse way and the restraint and common sense of the Irish people have kept us in a much better position.<\/p><p>  It is easy to use glib terminology like austerity and neo-liberalism and have a student union-type debate on the matter.  How does Mr. Murphy think that we can seek a level of forbearance from German taxpayers?  They have paid the piper whether we want to accept the fact or not.  How much forbearance can we expect from them?  The man or woman who works in a factory in Hamburg in Germany can examine his or her payslip to see the deductions that are being made.  How long will they tolerate the deductions being made without accountability, evidence of proven spending or some return?<\/p><p>  Austerity was not readily an option.  Does Mr. Murphy accept that there has been a shift in thinking?  Does he concede that there is an acceptance within Europe that austerity on its own has not worked and there is a movement towards stimulus?  While as an individual he is properly motivated, with great respect his analysis is simplistic, trifling nonsense and it is dangerous for young people to hear it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700008#G00200","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1362667800,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I do not know how I shall follow the last two interventions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700008#G00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1362667800,"counter":602,"content":"<p>The Deputy can have a go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700008#G00400","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1362667800,"counter":603,"content":"<p>The Deputy is a gentleman and is well fit for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700008#G00500","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1362667800,"counter":604,"content":"<p>It might be better if the Chairman left me until the next lot of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700008#G00600","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1362667800,"counter":605,"content":"<p>The Deputy should have a go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700008#G00700","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1362667800,"counter":606,"content":"<p>He can leave it to Fianna F&aacute;il again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700008#G00800","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1362667800,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I welcome all of our guests.

We pay one third of the market rate on our borrowings.  Because of our ability to get support from the troika, our sovereign bond yields have come down dramatically.  We talk about austerity.  Our debt to GDP ratio is supposed to be in the region of the height of the Customs House.  It is already higher than Liberty Hall and we are adding a couple of floors every year.  We are left with the choice to either saddle our children and their children with this debt to sort out the problem now.  If we do not sort out the problem now, they will have plenty of jobs in Boston and Cricklewood, however we are trying to create jobs in Ireland.<\/p><p>  When did this happen before?  From 1981 to 1987 we could not get agreement or control in the public finances.  I was elected three times to D&aacute;il Eireann during 1981-82 and a minority Fianna F&aacute;il Government was formed in 1987 and we in Fine Gael supported it to make the necessary cuts.  We left the vicious circle to become part of the virtuous circle, confidence was created and investment returned and jobs were created.  That is what is happening here.  We did not get a 30% increase in foreign direct investment in Ireland in 2011 because people simply liked the colour of our eyes.  They look at our country and see that we are prepared to make sacrifices, not just the Government and politicians but people voted for a pact which was difficult for them to do.  The sacrifices are paying dividends and will pay dividends.  There will be jobs.  We can talk ourselves into pessimism but we must be realistic about the opportunities ahead.<\/p><p>  We have just concluded our discussion on the MFF, and Deputy O'Reilly questioned whether it would go through Parliament.  I think it will go through Parliament but not in the format that has been agreed by the European Council.  We will not rubber-stamp anything that has been decided by another institution.  We are Parliament and are a separate institution and I would be quite happy that Parliament will make changes.<\/p><p>  We have been a member of the European Union for 40 years.  We are not net contributors to the budget yet, in spite of the Celtic tiger years nor are we forecast to become a contributor during the period of the MFF.  <\/p><p>  We eulogise the United Nations.  Did we ever have such solidarity from the United Nations?  When did we ever hold the post of Secretary General of the United Nations?  When did we ever have a commissioner or a Minister with such a role in the UN, in the way we play our role in the European Union?  We criticise the body that has done most for this country and eulogise the body that is dominated by the super powers.<\/p><p>  The issue of returning power to individual states was raised.  I do not want to give powers back because the powers that go back will go back to the Bundestag, the House of Commons and the French National Assembly.  We will get some powers, but what is best for Ireland is when we can pool power and exercise them together and the Commission acts as the independent proposer of laws under those powers.  We are in the Union and are treated in the same way as everybody else.  That suits the smaller member states.  Does one want to return to national domination as that does not suit smaller countries.  I am not in favour of it. <\/p><p>  In some countries, MEPs can address their parliament on EU issues in plenary session.  That helps to close the gap.  The members present know that few people ask them about their work on this committee or other committees.  Nobody puts a value on this work, however they value the work members do in their clinics and on the ground.  People may say that they only see you at election time, no matter how much they see you.  I do not think we should be bound by that.  We would live in a jungle if it was not for the fact that there are 140 odd judges.  The only judges the public hear about are those dealing with murder and rape but the other judges are doing their job every single day as part of the judicial wing of government.  It is our job as public representatives, whether we are Senators, TDs or MEPs to do the same.  It does not count when one is in the media.  What counts is whether one does a job.  That is what really counts.  It is very hard to get across to people, when one is involved in serious work what that work is about.  Europe will have 6% of the world's population in a very short period.  It was projected that the figure would be reached in 2050, but they are now saying we will reach that figure in 2030.  Countries such as Brazil, China, the United States, Russia and countries that we do not yet see in that way could be powerful.  The more we do together to play a role in the world, the better it will be for us.  It will lead to jobs.<\/p><p>  Deputy Donohoe raised the British situation.  I quite understand the situation in Britain.  We import more from Britain than from Latin America and Japan added together.  We are important to it as well as its being important to us.  The British people and Parliament must make a decision on the European Union in time.  I think more and more that if it comes to a decision of remaining in or leaving the EU, people will start to hear the counter arguments that they are not hearing at present.  Should the Prime Minister decide they want to be part of the Single Market, they must comply with the rules, but the rules are made by MEPs and Ministers and commissioners and the central bank and the courts have a role.  If Britain leaves the EU it will have no presence on any of those bodies and yet would have to comply with the rules.  I think we have only heard one part of the argument.<\/p><p>  I want to tell Deputy Durkan that we can all be impressed by terms, but what works in practice is important.  We in the Christian Democrats want to put &quot;social&quot; back in the social market economy.  For far too long, we gave a free hand to the market and there is no such thing as the market.  I recommend that members read a book entitled <i>Finance and the Good Society<\/i> by Professor Robert Shiller and learn what he says about the markets.  Markets should be opened up to profit and loss and should be properly regulated.  Business people should behave in an ethical manner.  I am a businessman, my business is politics.  I think politicians have been getting it right and it is time business people got it right as well.  I make no apologies for people who have been doing things the wrong way round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700009#H01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gay Mitchell, MEP","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362669000,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I will now ask Deputy Donohoe to take over as Chairman for the remainder of the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700010#J00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362669000,"counter":636,"content":"<p>A number of the joint committee's members touched on the democratic deficit issue and the disengagement of people from European affairs.  That is why I tried to focus my remarks on re-engaging with citizens.  The best way we can do that is through the development of a truly European social model.  That is where the future of Europe has to go if it is to remain engaged with citizens.  Otherwise, citizens will feel - as my colleague, Paul Murphy MEP, said - that they are only servicing banks and that Europe is not interested in working for people.  I still believe in the original founding values and principles of the European Union, which are enshrined in the treaty.  They are also in the 2020 strategy, but we need to work towards them.<\/p><p>  As to why it has taken so long to make progress on a social compact and why we have not been examining social investment, we have very much fallen down in that area.  Many observers have been struck by the fact that the IMF can come in and talk about the multiplier effect of austerity, yet one still has to get the EU to react to that.  We are trying to address the issue in the European Parliament.  For every euro we take out of the economy, the multiplier effect of that on nations is much worse.  The IMF has pointed out this and there is a growing realisation of it within the European institutions.<\/p><p>  Part of the democratic deficit is the Franco-German alliance that was built up during the early years of the crisis.  That created huge problems, not just for Europe generally but also for the European institutions.  The European Council was being by-passed in many ways because the Franco-German alliance met in advance of Council meetings.  France and Germany were deciding the agenda and determining how decisions would be made at Council meetings.  The European Parliament was also being ignored despite the fact that it has enhanced powers since the Lisbon treaty.  It is important to acknowledge the parliament's legitimate and democratic powers. <\/p><p>  On a number of occasions, Deputy O'Reilly quoted Martin Schulz, who is the former leader of our group and now President of the European Parliament.  Mr. Schulz put it well in saying that we need a return to the community method.  We need to ensure that all the institutions, including the European Parliament, are playing a participative role.  <\/p><p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked if the multiannual financial framework<font color=\"#222222\"> or <\/font>MFF will get through.  I agree with my colleague, Mr. Gay Mitchell MEP, that it will not get through in its current format.  The European Parliament is deeply unhappy with many aspects of the MFF as it is currently presented, including the levels of funding.  As I said in my introduction, the European budget must be a mechanism to deliver growth.  The MFF must be fit for purpose and not just seen as an item of expenditure but also as able to invest in growth and development across the EU.  Much negotiation remains to be done with the European Parliament.  We will have a resolution on this matter at the parliament's plenary session in Strasbourg next week.  We will give a mandate to our negotiators and will demand serious changes to the MFF.<\/p><p>  The youth guarantee measure will follow the individual in trying to develop a career path.  It is not about slotting young people into existing programmes and courses, but about determining a career path.  The sum of &euro;6 billion is a start and is welcome.  Countries and regions with youth unemployment exceeding 25% will be targeted, which is to be welcomed.  I have met with a number of community organisations and groups that are examining practical aspects of implementing the youth guarantee.  A number of questions have arisen and I look forward to discussing these issues with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, in future.  <\/p><p>  The Ballymun jobs centre has done amazing work with young unemployed people.  The centre has applied for a pilot scheme and it is hoped it will be able to pilot the youth guarantee later this year.  That might provide a template and model for future youth guarantee projects.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kyne mentioned the 83% social spend in education.  We cannot afford to look at spending on education or social welfare as just another item of public expenditure.  We must look at it as a social investment.  We must also monitor how we are using our social budgets to ensure the most vulnerable are protected at all times.  That is the whole principle behind the social investment strategy that was launched last week by Commissioner L&aacute;szl&oacute; Andor.  If refers to breaking the cycle of disadvantage concerning child poverty.  We have high rates of child poverty in this country and must therefore address those issues.<\/p><p>  I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to attend the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Emer Costello, MEP"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362669000,"counter":637,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman, for the vigorous debate.

If one asks President Barroso whether a silent revolution is happening within the European Union, he will say \"Yes\".  Moreover, that is not the only time he said it, as he has done so repeatedly because it reflects a process that actually is happening.  However, he is in favour of it.  Consequently, one should engage in respect of the silent revolution that is happening and should make arguments in its favour instead of pretending it is not happening.  Similarly, all the points I made in respect of the six-pack and the two-pack are facts with which one must engage.  I presume members' parties consider these to be good things, which is fine, but members should defend them.  Let us have an argument but one should not try to pretend this is not what is happening, because power is being transferred from elected governments to the European Commission.  Rules are being imposed that comprise the imposition of neo-liberal policies.  This is what is happening at present and we should be discussing whether that is a good or bad thing.<\/p><p>  As for the point about Greece, I have heard a highly irritating point being made a number of times, which is that Greece is in this disastrous situation because the people protested.  The left is not in power in Greece and the genuine left has not been in power in Greece.  The people who have been in power in Greece over the past number of decades have been PASOK, which is the sister party of the Labour Party here, and New Democracy, which presumably sits in the same group as does Fine Gael in the European Parliament.  These are the only groups which ever have been in power.  In the last elections, Syriza almost came to power but did not.  Consequently, one cannot place the disaster the Greek people face as being the responsibility of the left because the left has not had a chance to govern yet in Greece.  When Syriza is elected- as I believe it will be- let us see whether it is up to the challenge.<\/p><p>  In addition, one cannot blame the fact that people are protesting.  There is mass homelessness in Greece.  I raised the point at a previous meeting of this joint committee, with a Greek ambassador present, about the increase in prostitution in Greece.  People were outraged and members were appalled that I was slandering the name of Greece.  However, it is a fact.  I stand in solidarity with the people of Greece and visited Greece five times last year.

Moreover, in my opinion, if we continue with the same austerity policies Greece offers a certain picture of where we are heading.  It is where we will be or contains elements of where we will be in one or two years' time and so on.<\/p><p>  Fourth, members have asked whether German taxpayers should continue to pay for the crisis.  German taxpayers are not paying for people in Greece, Portugal, Ireland or Spain but are paying for German banks.  It is a trick by the German establishment.  It precisely is propaganda by the German establishment to state Germany is bailing out the lazy Greeks and lazy Spanish, as well as the not so lazy Irish, who are doing a good job, are good pupils, etc.  While there is opposition within Germany to the idea of bailing out German banks, it is a trick to try to ensure there is not more opposition.  I do not believe the German taxpayers should pay for it either.  One reason we are in this crisis and for the fundamental imbalance in the European Union between northern Europe, primarily represented by Germany, and southern Europe, that is, the so-called PIGS economies, is because wages were suppressed in Germany from the time of the Schr&ouml;der Government.  That SPD Government suppressed wages in Germany with the likes of the Hartz IV reforms and the Agenda 2010 initiative.  Such suppressed wages meant that Germany won the race to the bottom with regard to who would be most competitive within the eurozone, because all were trapped together with no opportunity for internal devaluation.  This is one reason for the imbalance within the eurozone and I am in favour of a struggle by German workers to refuse to pay for those debts and to fight for higher wages and better conditions.<\/p><p>  As for whether the debate on austerity has moved on in the European Union, the answer is \"No\".  I acknowledge the debate at the level of the international thinkers for capitalism, the economists, has moved on.  People are recognising that even within the framework of capitalism, austerity at all times might not be the best possible solution, as evidenced by the IMF in the debate on the multipliers.  However, members should read the response to the IMF, written last week by Commissioner Rehn, on the question of the multipliers.  It was a personal response that simply dismisses everything the IMF has stated about the multipliers and states we must continue on and on.  The vast majority of the Commissioners are real ideological neo-liberals who are committed to this.  They think it will work and it is working for the people who they actually represent.  As to whether I believe in the European Union, I believe it exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700011#K02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Murphy, MEP"},{"type":"speech","time":1362669600,"counter":663,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Murphy perceive the youth guarantee and all that represents as being progressive?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013030700011#K02600","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362669600,"counter":664,"content":"<p>I will take the question.  While I believe it exists, I do not consider the European Union as currently constituted to be something that is good for working people in Ireland, Germany, Spain, Portugal or wherever.  A fundamentally different type of Europe is needed, namely, a socialist Europe.<\/p><p>  As for whether measures such as the youth guarantee, the promissory notes and the other things contradict my analysis, they do not.  On the question of promissory notes, Ireland got relatively little.  As we still will be paying bonds that simply will get burned by the Irish Central Bank, it is not a fundamental deal.  It does not change fundamentally the fact that Ireland's debt is unsustainable.  We will not be able to pay it and in my opinion, at a certain stage we will not pay it.  I consider the youth guarantee scheme to be welcome but inadequate, as more is needed.  The current Government in Ireland is a neo-liberal Government.  I acknowledge it raised the minimum wage and did away with Fianna F&aacute;il's cutting of the minimum wage.  Sometimes Governments, Commissions or whatever pursue policies that are not in line with the main thrust of events because they are under pressure from below.  There is a crisis of youth unemployment with almost 6 million young people who are unemployed across the European Union and consequently, Governments and Commissioners must be seen to be doing something.

What brought the change in Europe is when the European people found themselves at the centre of an appalling crisis with massive loss of life.  Louis XIV is supposed to have said that he found France in its ashes.  The founders of modern Europe found Europe in its ashes and with repercussions worldwide.  That is what focused people then.

Some of them have an income that is only a portion of ours.  They want to grow with Europe.  The European Union is a work in progress.  It is imperfect, but the reality is that from Malta to Finland and from Ireland to Poland we have developed institutions and a new way of doing our business.  Not only are we deepening and broadening the Union, we are also planning for our role in the world beyond the 2030s, as I mentioned previously, when Europe will be such a smaller place.  I hope we will still produce something like 20% of the world&rsquo;s GDP.  We produce approximately 25% of it currently.<\/p><p>  It has been a good exercise for this country in general.  It has not been all positive but if we are to look to the future it is our role in Europe which is creating confidence.  We have no doubt about where we stand in terms of the euro and our membership of the European Union.  When people are looking at an English-speaking, common law system in which to invest, more and more they are picking Ireland.  What we must do it build on that.  This country needs two things; cashflow and confidence.  As we get cashflow under control, confidence returns.

We must build on that good news.  Any amount of state control of people&rsquo;s lives will not change that.  People do not want state control.  Sometimes the best thing we can do as politicians is get out of the way and let people get on with their lives.  We should only regulate properly the things we need to regulate and that are best regulated.  We are a work in progress.  We have a long way to go to have something with which we will all be satisfied but, by and large, if we stock-take we can see that much progress has been made and there is more ahead.

It is marginal and in the direction the Government is moving and the section provides an opportunity to accelerate the move.  <\/p><p>  There are four elements to the price of tobacco - the specific tax, the <i>ad valorem<\/i> tax, VAT and the non-tax price.  The idea is that the <i>ad valorem<\/i> tax would be reduced to zero.  We are aware that because of EU rules it cannot be zero.  It would be great if the Minister and his officials would consider tabling an amendment on Report Stage.  I proposed a nominal tax of 0.2% to comply with EU rules.  The main reason for this is that if one examines prices between 2001 and 2011 -  the breakdown for 2012 is not yet available - the price of a pack increased by 75%, while the non-tax element which goes to the manufacturers and transporters but not the retailers increased by 72%.  The Irish Cancer Society states the Government has been doing the right thing by increasing the price, but, at the same time, the manufacturers have used the opportunity to significantly increase their profits.  I do not have evidence to back this up, but the Irish Cancer Society asserts - it has data which I have not seen - they are subsidising the cheaper cigarettes.  The more expensive cigarettes take a bigger hit, while the cheaper cigarettes remain cheap, thus minimising the potential impact, which could be considerable.  The data we have suggest a &euro;1 increase in the price of a pack would reduce consumption by approximately 4%, which would be useful.  Anyone who smokes ten cigarettes a day spends approximately &euro;1,500 a year, but a &euro;1 increase would lead to a 4% reduction in consumption.  This is similar to our discussion on university fees.  There is an opportunity to accelerate what seems to be Government policy and bring the <i>ad valorem<\/i> tax to just above zero.  The idea is that it would minimise the tobacco companies' ability to keep cheaper cigarettes cheap, thus keep people smoking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700003#B01400","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1362650400,"counter":726,"content":"<p>In principle, we in Sinn F&eacute;in do not oppose the increase in the price of tobacco, particularly if it is genuinely intended to change attitudes and behaviour in society.  However, the reality we face is that the market has been flooded with illegal cigarettes which are sold on the street.  That is the case in most larger towns and some small ones.  There is easy access to illegal cigarettes which causes a number of problems.  The State loses revenue through taxes and so on and because the trade is illegal it puts a strain on Garda resources in policing the issue. In addition, if somebody can buy a pack of cigarettes for &euro;4 or &euro;5, increasing the price will not reduce consumption or usage of the product because the danger is it will drive people to the underground market.  In principle, we do not oppose increasing tobacco prices, but instead of the section providing for a grab of additional revenue for the Exchequer, the revenue should be ring-fenced to try to change behaviour.  For example, if the additional money accruing from this increase was ring-fenced to target the black market sale of tobacco, I would support the proposal.  That is the reason I opposed the section.  While increasing the price of cigarettes is fine and there are many reasons that should happen, particularly to lower the incidence of cancer and so on, what should be done, if we are genuine about this, is that we should ring-fence the money to make sure we tackle the issue of the sale of illegal cigarettes in most large towns and cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700003#B01500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362651000,"counter":727,"content":"<p>Given that at least one in four cigarettes is contraband, the fines and penalties imposed on those who are caught carrying, shipping or selling contraband tobacco appear to be low.

The motivation related to those who transported goods abroad.  If our model for recovery is export-led growth, one can justify in policy terms a rebate for the people who carry our exported goods into other countries.<\/p><p>  Rebates were available in Belgium and France.  Instead of buying diesel in Ireland, hauliers were filling up abroad for their return journeys.  In revenue terms, what I have done is justified by the prospect of a transfer of purchasing activity back to Ireland from the rebated diesel abroad.  I extended this provision subsequently to people involved in bus travel, the motive being to provide a further small incentive to the tourism industry.  The people in the coach hire business do not buy diesel abroad.  All of their stuff is domestic.  No clawback is available in that respect.<\/p><p>  The provision is focused and restricted.  We do not want a rebate for everyone who carries goods, cattle or anything else.

I am conscious of the costs involved for the Exchequer and of the risk that such a scheme is open to abuse.  Accordingly, one means of facilitating compliance is to restrict access to the scheme to tax compliant and licensed operators.<\/p><p>  In providing the tax relief, I do not believe that own account operators are, for the most part, in competition with hire and reward operators, since most are by their nature providing transport services for their own products.  In this regard, while I appreciate that companies have reduced overheads as much as possible, own account operators have a greater facility to incorporate transport costs within the overall cost of the product.  I am also aware that some own account operators have Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport licences in respect of that part of their fleets that provides an element of hire and reward services, but my main concern in this area is to ensure the risk of fraud around the rebate scheme is minimised.  The requirement to hold an operator's licence from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or an equivalent licence recognised under EU law is a significant element of the compliance regime.<\/p><p>  The haulage industry's argument was that the amendment would be cost neutral.

The challenge existed because of the practice of Irish road hauliers to fill up overseas.  It made sense to try to bring that activity back home.<\/p><p>  However, as with any action, there is a reaction somewhere else down the line.  The difficulty is that a licensed road haulier who carries out international activity will in many cases also do domestic work, which might relate to the haulage of foodstuff or livestock.  The impact on the operator who is outside the licensed regime will be that an unfair competitive advantage will be given to the licensed road haulier.  While understanding and supporting what the Minister did, I make the point that in order to bring equity to the domestic market the rebate scheme must incorporate the relatively small number of operators who will now be at a disadvantage because they are, in effect, paying more for their diesel.<\/p><p>  An issue also arises in terms of the small supplier of goods to the catering sector and the concrete manufacturer, among others.  The amendment does not seek to resolve their issue but I signal to the Minister that we will table an amendment on Report Stage to address it.

I understand a complex algorithm has been devised in which the rebate was calculated based on the initial fuel price at the pump.  The Minister has chosen a rebate of 7.5 cent per litre.  My understanding is that the EU directive on rebates allows the Minister to allow up to a 15 cent rebate.  It is not the case that he would pay out 15 cent but it would give him such a range.  If the Bill provided for it, it would be possible to pay up to 15 cent in the event of the price of oil increasing to an astronomical level.  It is the case under the current algorithm that if the price of diesel at the pump goes below &euro;1 there will be no rebate to the haulier.  I call on the Minister to extend the scale, which is between zero and 7.5 cent, to between zero and 15 cent, which falls within the provision of the appropriate EU directive on fuel rebates.

Sinn F&eacute;in did not propose that in its alternative budget.  We are very mindful of the lobby arguing for an increase in alcohol prices.  There are also issues in terms of the minimum pricing of alcohol which are different and where action needs to be taken.<\/p><p>  However, this measure is really a dip into people's pockets.  Coming from a Border county, I would be very conscious of the additional &euro;1 on a bottle of wine.  The Minister will have been very familiar with the drive a number of years ago for cross-Border shopping.  While there are different elements to that drive at any point in time, in particular the rate of sterling, one of the surveys done, which has not been disputed, showed that one of the motivation factors which drove people across the Border was the purchase of alcohol.  Anyone who stopped in Asda in Strabane or who went to Newry would see people filling up their trolleys with alcohol.  It has a bad effect in that if one goes into a shop for one bottle of wine but sees bottles of wine for &pound;3.50, one will buy more than one planned.

Representatives of the industry are telling me it is not the case that the price at which they sell wine increases but that it is multiplied.  They have explained the position to me, but I cannot quite remember exactly how the measure works.  I believe the way it works is that the supplier must increase the cost by &euro;1, after which the price rises further because of VAT, etc., such that the price charged to the customer increases by significantly more than &euro;1.  This stood out for me as being a little unusual.  We obviously have very high prices here relative to other European countries.  I am not necessarily opposing the increase, but it feels as if the Government has gone too far in one specific area by targeting one group of people, mainly winesellers.  What are the Minister's thoughts on this?  Might this measure be revised and reversed a little?  Perhaps the Minister might rebalance it against others.  It appears that one particular product which some very good, responsible businesspeople sell as their only product has been singled out for a major increase.<\/p><p>  I support Deputy Pearse Doherty's point on below-cost selling.

There had been no general excise increase on alcohol products since 1994.  In the circumstances in which we find ourselves it is legitimate to increase excise duty on alcohol.  First, it involves discretionary expenditure.  Rather than increase tax where people had no choice but to pay it, it was decided to tax items where there was real choice, as in the case of smoking or drinking alcohol.  This is a better way to impose taxation.  The yield is very significant on these increases, amounting to &euro;180 million in a full year.  When in our debates we realise how difficult it is to achieve a yield of &euro;25 million, &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million, we must acknowledge that a yield of &euro;180 million is significant, especially when there has not been a general increase since 1994 and considering that the market does not seem to be particularly price sensitive.  The value of wine sales increased in February.  Therefore, the increase did not seem to have any effect on sales.<\/p><p>  One aspect of the rationale which the Deputy might describe as unfair or otherwise centred on my desire to have a policy that would restrict the sale of cheap alcohol in off-licences, particularly supermarkets.  It has proved beyond my ability to come up with a policy.  We tried every which way last year to determine whether we could do it, but we could not find a legal way of differentiating between on-sales and off-sales.  We talked about closed containers and all sorts of matters.  We ran through the whole gamut but could not find a solution.  Our goal can be achieved through minimum pricing orders.  That is the approach taken in Scotland, but it has been challenged in the Scottish courts.  We will see how it works out.  If the mechanism proves to be legal in Scotland, we might be able to move in that direction here.  However, in the absence of a solution, one must acknowledge that the imposition of an extra &euro;1 in excise duty on wine represents a greater imposition than that on other alcohol products, amounting to 10 cent.  Very little wine is sold in the on-trade; it is the off-licence trade that counts.  Certainly, it is skewed and this is not a proportionate imposition of excise duty across the trade.  There is more excise duty on wine, but this is because it is largely associated with the off-licence trade.<\/p><p>  I was amazed at the statistics and hope I am recalling them correctly.  My officials can correct me if I am wrong.  When we were making the decision, approximately 24% of all alcohol sales involved wine.  I remember reading in the newspaper after the 1969 election that the late Conor Cruise O'Brien, on having his first meal in the Members' restaurant, ordered a bottle of red wine and the manager had to send someone to Mitchell &amp;amp; Son on Kildare Street to get one.  There was no wine in-house in Leinster House in 1969.  One can see the change in practice that has occurred.  That is the thinking behind the tax.<\/p><p>  The &euro;1 increase includes VAT.  All of the other excise increases also include VAT.  Consequently, the 10 cent increase on beer or the unit of whiskey is VAT inclusive.  I do not know what the calculation was, but I do know that the result is a straight increase of &euro;1.  There is a peculiarity, however.  The excise duty on wine and other alcohol products is imposed by volume; therefore, there is no differentiation between a cheap bottle and a dear bottle of wine.  A cheap bottle of wine purchased in the local garage attracts an extra euro in excise duty, while a bottle of wine worth &euro;70 purchased in a good restaurant also attracts an extra euro.  It is not price related but volume related.  I believed this was a little peculiar, but I am not in a position to change it.  I do not believe, however, that it is particularly worth changing.  That is the only peculiarity I found in the imposition of excise duty on wine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700008#G00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362653400,"counter":815,"content":"<p>It is good to hear about the February sales.

If one goes to the supermarket or off-licence, a bottle of wine - before this increase - was &euro;7; it is now approximately &euro;8.  Even the &euro;1 increase will not force consumers onto the on-sales.  The figures are disproportionate for sales in restaurants or pubs for a glass of wine compared to buying a bottle in a supermarket or off-licence.<\/p><p>  Another concern of mine, which the Minister himself raised, is that the majority of those who buy a bottle of wine for &euro;8 are those who do not have much disposable income but there is not the same impact on those who are able to buy the more expensive wine.  There is something the Minister needs to do on that in terms of fairness.<\/p><p>  This is not the best approach.

Even though they may have central heating in their houses, oil is too expensive.

What is proposed in this Bill will worsen a situation that is already unacceptable for elderly people.  As I stated earlier, this increase taken in conjunction with the reduction in the period in respect of which the fuel allowance is paid, will hurt.  Elderly people may die as a result of it.

People must have alternatives.  If the cheapest way people can heat their home is to light a fire in a fireplace then they must be offered alternatives that are not damaging to the environment.

An effective date of 1 May in practical terms means that the increase will not apply until September or October, when they commence purchasing solid fuels for the winter period.  When it is further increased in 2014, there will not be a full year effect until 2015 because again the date of implementation is May 2015.  Choices have to be made.  There is an environmental agenda, which includes commitments to reduce carbon levels.  Solid fuels, comparative to other fossil fuels, are the larger generator of carbon CO<sub>2<\/sub>.<\/p><p>  On poorer people being disproportionately affected by this, no change is proposed in the fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme to assist with home heating.  This is payable to people on long-term social welfare payments and will continue to be paid for 26 weeks in 2013.  The carbon tax will apply on the generality of solid fuel consumption.  However, the fuel allowance will be maintained to facilitate people who need assistance with heating their homes.  Many of the difficulties that arise in this regard relate to poor insulation of homes rather than a lack of money for fuel.  Since 2000, almost 93,000 energy poor homes have received energy performance upgrades under the warmer homes scheme.  The expected spend on this scheme in 2012 is estimated to be more than &euro;21 million.  To end December 2012, just over 12,000 energy poor homes received energy performance upgrades.  In 2012, the <i>Keep Well and Warm<\/i> booklet was reproduced and distributed to more than 64,000 individuals and energy affordability stakeholders.  The Keep Well and Warm website was also updated.  In consultation with key stakeholders work was carried out this year on the development of GIS mapping for energy poverty and new eligibility criteria.<\/p><p>  The warmer homes strategy for affordable energy in Ireland set out 48 actions to be implemented over the life of the strategy, including activation of economies of scale and harnessing community effort through the introduction of an area-based approach to mitigating energy poverty.  Many of the suggestions implicit in Deputy Boyd Barrett's contribution have been and will continue to be taken up.  I expect the Minister with responsibility for energy will in the near future further reinforce schemes to ensure homes are more energy efficient.<\/p><p>  On whether a switch to carbon-neutral products such as timber and logs is the answer, it is certainly an answer in rural areas.  Many people in rural areas, in particular those in the farming community, have invested in a chain saw and have been planting small areas of their farms that are marginal with trees.  That is quite common now.  Also, solid fuel burners, which are being installed on a widespread basis now, produce a great deal of heat from the burning of logs and are very efficient.  However, a storage issue arises in terms of log and timber burning in city areas.  Many people living in cities, in particular those living in social housing, do not have storage space for a lorry load of logs.  One would need a lot of logs or timber to get one through the winter.  The same applies in regard to turf, which people from rural communities will understand.  A person whose home is on a large site can stack the turf, etc., at the gable end but where space is at a premium storage of logs and peat, etc., is not an answer to the problem.<\/p><p>  While we are following one agenda by increasing the carbon tax on solid fuel, we are also following another agenda in terms of preventing people on long-term social welfare payments from being affected by cold winters.  In this regard, the fuel allowance will be maintained for the full 26 weeks in 2013.  There is also a move towards more carbon neutral products and the insulation of homes and so on.  All of these actions taken together form a pattern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700011#L00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362655200,"counter":844,"content":"<p>A couple of other issues arise, including the cross-Border element of this.  As I understand it, the sulphur level of coal in the North is lower.  There were reports last year of lorries from the North delivering coal to areas as far away as Cork.  This tax could exacerbate that situation.  I raise that issue because I support cross-Border trade.  However, there are different regulations in both jurisdictions in terms of sulphur content.<\/p><p>  I would like to focus on the issue of fuel poverty.  The Minister is correct that Sustainable Energy Ireland has put in place schemes to assist people.  He also quoted figures in regard to how many people have availed of those schemes.  However, I draw the Minister's attention to the detail of those schemes.  As a matter of interest, my home heating system broke recently and I had to upgrade it.  If memory serves me correctly, people wishing to avail of the SEI grant must meet the first &euro;2,500 cost of upgrading their system.  It would not cost that amount to install thermostats on radiators so as to control which rooms one wants to heat and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700011#L00400","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362655800,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's answers in the sense he is engaging with the issues we are raising, but while moves are being made towards more sustainable forms and uses of energy to reduce CO2 emissions, it always seems to be that only those least in a position to do so bear the cost of these transitions or suffering most as a result of the transition.  I am a firm believer that if one wants people to move in an alternative direction one must put the alternative infrastructure in place and overcome whatever technical difficulties there may be to do this.  The Minister stated there is nowhere to store logs in urban areas and this is a fair point, but there is no reason we could not have depots in estates or particular areas where people could buy small amounts of carbon-neutral environmentally friendly fuels, in particular wood, because it links into an area the Government also has a commitment to develop and expand, namely, forestry, which could generate employment.  It seems a no-brainer that we would move more decisively in this direction and provide people with this alternative instead of always having to hit people and see what we can come up with afterwards.<\/p><p>  I would say the same about insulation.  As Deputy Doherty pointed out, there is a cost involved, and several times I have asked the Minister whether we could have a scheme, particularly for those who cannot afford it, whereby nothing would be paid upfront for the retrofit and insulation of a house but the cost would be added to energy bills afterwards.  This would not be an extra cost because the householders will have made a saving in their energy costs.  What they would be charged on an incremental basis would be the difference between what they used to pay and the saving, so there would be no extra burden.  It would mean insulation could happen fast and people would not have to pay the money upfront.  It would also generate a huge number of jobs for the many people trained in the insulation business.  My local further education college teaches courses on BER energy ratings.  People are being trained but there is nothing for them to do.  We do not seem to be moving fast and decisively enough in this direction and those who cannot afford to be hit gets hit with the cost of it.  This is unfair and, frankly, in the case of elderly people it is dangerous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700012#M00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1362655800,"counter":847,"content":"<p>This is an interesting discussion and I do not disagree with much of what Deputy Boyd Barrett has said, such as his proposal on applying the costs of energy conservation measures to the electricity bill.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has had discussions along these lines with the ESB.  I do not know the state of the discussions at present, but it is an idea which is being pursued at the highest level in terms of ministerial responsibility.  It would also deal with the point Deputy Doherty made, about poor households not having the upfront money to enable them to draw down the grant subsequently.<\/p><p>  On the general policy position, my view is that if it is necessary to take action on fuels which generate quite a lot of CO2 then the application should be universal after which we would have alternative schemes to relieve the burden on the minority of people affected.  This is where the Department of Social Protection's fuel allowance comes in.<\/p><p>  I do not know whether the guys in the pick-up trucks still go around with bags of coals in large housing estates in Dublin, but it is quite common in my city.  Sometimes they also have bags of timber.  The supply seems to be a bit uncertain and it is not always available.  With regard to elderly people, there is also a weight issue.  A bucket of coal, or a half a bucket of coal, is much handier to bring into a house if one is elderly than the supply of blocks one needs for the night.  One would need a great big basket of blocks beside the fire, and lifting and carrying this as well as storage are issues.  It is not an exact solution.<\/p><p>  The imposition of the tax is at the first point of supply.  The carbon tax will have been applied to the coal being supplied by the guys in the pick-up trucks, so they are not involved in some type of black market activity and evading the tax.  Their trade will not be affected because it is those who supply them with the fuels who will have to bear the carbon tax.<\/p><p>  With regard to Northern lorries delivering coal as far south as Cork, this was one of the concerns which delayed bringing forward this measure.  The introduction of the solid fuel carbon tax was delayed to allow for a mechanism to be put in place to address the risk of coal products with lower environmental standards being sourced from outside the State.  Regulations to enable local authorities regulate and control the type of coal supplied in the State were put in place by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It was on this basis the commencement date for the solid fuel carbon tax with effect from 1 May was announced in the budget in December.  Measures have been taken to alleviate concerns about cross-Border trade with even less environmentally friendly solid fuels.  I do not know whether the local authorities have moved following the Department's change or not, but individual local authorities may regulate for this in their functional area and should do so.  This explains some of the considerations with regard to the timing I have introduced.<\/p><p>  The Government must do more, and will do so, on energy-related policies to make homes more energy friendly.  The same should apply to the great stock of public buildings run by the OPW.  I would think the cost of heating and lighting office blocks throughout the public service could be greatly reduced if work was carried out to make them more energy friendly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700012#M00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362655800,"counter":848,"content":"<p>We could start here.

I know the bands have been moved around but, by and large, the tables seem to be pretty much the same.  If my note is correct, the estimate for the tax yield is &euro;50 million, but where is that sum coming from?  I may be wrong, but a comparison of the tables does not seem to show too many differences.  Perhaps the Minister could explain where the &euro;50 million comes from.  Is it from the higher end, from the lower end, or from the moving around of certain bands?<\/p><p>  I agree with consumption tax and with the provisions whereby more environmentally friendly cars are incentivised.  There is a missed opportunity here, however, so perhaps the Minister could consider it for next year's budget.  The percentages could be changed more, particularly at the lower end.  The provision of really attractive tax-based incentives for highly environmentally efficient new cars is something that has been done quite successfully in the United Kingdom.  This is a reasonable progression, but there is potential, with regard to super-environmentally friendly cars, to ratchet down the percentages significantly at the lower end.  Maybe that could be offset by increasing them a bit more at the higher end.  Will the Minister examine that matter?<\/p><p>  I support what Deputy Doherty said.

The early figures for 2013 are extremely weak.  It is projected that approximately 70,000 vehicles will be sold over the course of the year.  I have grave concerns about the direction in which this is going.  The industry is in real difficulty.  I think we will see more job losses in major dealerships over the months ahead.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.<\/p><p>  I would like to raise an associated issue that relates to VRT and motor vehicles.  The Minister will be aware that large families - with three, four or perhaps more children - need a certain size of car if they are to comply with the road safety regulations and the proper standards for child and baby seats, etc.  It is not like the old days when everyone piled into the boot.  When we are framing our motor tax and VRT policy, we need to bear in mind that the cost of buying, taxing and running a family vehicle - even if one has the money to buy a new one - is prohibitive for many people.  I suggest that the current policy is very much weighed against the family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700014#O00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1362657000,"counter":864,"content":"<p>When the legislation remodelling the car tax system was first introduced in 2008, it brought about a complete change in the operation of this country's auto industry.  If Deputies will excuse the pun, it could be said that we were in a different environment at that time.  Approximately 20% of the national fleet of vehicles had diesel engines in 2008, but I understand that has since increased to approximately 60% among new purchases.  I will pick up on the point made by Deputy Donnelly.  The real difficulty that emerged from the model that was put in place by the Government of that time relates to the fact that the most efficient cars are manufactured by significant brand leaders like Lexus, BMW, Audi and Mercedes.  As a result, one can tax a top-of-the-range Lexus or Mercedes for less than one might spend on taxing a Fiesta with a petrol engine.  There has to be some redressing of the issue.  The problem is that whereas it costs something like &euro;106 or &euro;108 to tax a top-of-the-range Audi, one has to pay &euro;300 or &euro;400 simply because one bought a little Toyota or Ford with a petrol engine.  Something has to be done to address that.  My recollection of the debate on the original legislation is that it was based on an assumption that we would have a petrol fleet into the future, with a minimal adjustment to diesel, but that did not happen.  I do not think the Minister of the time or anybody else foresaw what actually happened.  The position flipped over completely in 2008 and 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700014#O00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1362657000,"counter":865,"content":"<p>Many of the concerns expressed by the Chairman are motor tax issues rather than VRT issues.  Motor tax is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The changes made by the Minister to the schedule of motor tax have helped to redress some of the Chairman's concerns.  Obviously, there is still a distance to go.  The significant changes made to the VRT regime in 2008 were driven by the Green Party Ministers, John Gormley and Eamon Ryan, in the Government of the time.  They were generally the subject of a great deal of approval at that time.  The intention of the scheme was to set very low rates of VRT, and consequently tax, on environmentally friendly vehicles.  The transfer took place.  I always believe tax breaks are good if one knows what are one's intended consequences.  A tax break which changes either economic or social behaviour in an intended direction is a justified tax break.  This is what was done.  Between 80% and 85% of the fleet now comprises new-model environmentally friendly motor cars.  Those who are holding out by continuing to have environmentally unfriendly cars are paying the higher rates.  The tax break is no longer necessary.<\/p><p>  I will set out the position in which the Exchequer has found itself in this context in these more stringent times.  The yield from VRT and motor tax was &euro;1.4 billion before the changes took place in 2008.  That dropped to &euro;400 million in the past three years.  Now that the tax break has achieved its purpose, I have to examine the reduction from &euro;1.4 billion to &euro;400 million in the context of the position we are in.  Obviously, some rebalancing in the opposite direction is now required.  I will explain where the figure of &euro;50 million came from.  After the custom and practice changed in the way I have described, the vast bulk of cars were in the lowest band.  We increased the yield by putting in more bands and thereby bringing some cars into a slightly higher band.  The overall figure of &euro;50 million was achieved by means of a general readjustment across the bands and slight changes in the rates.  I cannot point to a single cause.  The yield was achieved on foot of a general rebalancing.  I understand what Deputies are saying.  Everything I did was done after consultation with the trade.  We gave an indication of the new VRT rates to the trade at the end of August so that companies would know what the rates would be when they were placing their new orders for cars.  They advertised those rates in their trade magazines.  There was no big surprise about it.  They should not have been surprised by our intention to take more revenue from motor tax.<\/p><p>  The companies expressed major concerns about car sales in 2013 to me and to my officials.  One company had conducted a survey which indicated that people were conscious of the fact that other people are superstitious about the number 13.  Its research work had shown that the sale of cars in 2013 would drop by 20%.  Nobody likes to admit that they get upset when they see four magpies or a black cat, or that they do not like to walk under a ladder.  Those who told the researchers they would not buy a car in 2013 explained that while they would have no problem with such a car and are not superstitious, they know there are many superstitious people out there and are worried that such people will not buy second-hand cars with \"13\" plates when the time comes for them to change their cars.  That was what came out of the research.  The trade asked us to consider providing for two registration periods each year, as is done in the UK, in order to try to remediate that.  We have done that.  We have got away from \"13\" plates by providing for \"131\" plates in the first half of the year and \"132\" plates in the second half of the year.<\/p><p>  The trade's argument was not entirely based on the projected reduction in sales in 2013.  It also pointed to the cash flow and staffing problems caused by such a high proportion of their sales taking place in the first couple of months of the year.  Up to now, the companies have had to gear up with additional staff and salespersons early in the year, only to have to make them redundant as the year goes by.  They try to pick them up again at the start of the following year.  They argued that if there were two peaks in sales, they would be able to work with a lower number of expert staff over the 12-month period as a whole and would be able to incentivise those workers by making them permanent.  We followed their advice.  I do not know how the year will work out, but I have noted that a 20% year-on-year reduction in new car sales was recorded in January.  Having said that, the numbers in the first three weeks of last year were extraordinary because people had pre-bought to avoid the VAT increase.  Many cars were ordered between the budget of early December 2011 and Christmas of that year.  They were delivered in January 2012.  The point of sale was recorded as having taken place before the introduction of the 23% VAT rate.  The figures began to fall away after that artificial boost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700014#O00400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362657600,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I am aware the Minister's private secretary is about six feet off the ground outside the door as I understand the Minister has to meet Christine Lagarde shortly.

I have raised the issue numerous times.  While I have a problem with the way in which VRT is structured we will park it, but the Minister needs to do something for family cars.  I do not drive a seven-seater car but my wife does.  She has to as it would be illegal for her not to do so.  Whenever we have the children with us we have to use the seven-seater car because our oldest child is only seven years and our youngest child is ten months, and we have four.  We have to purchase a new or a second-hand seven-seater car.  Old cars are affected this year if one buys across the Border.  A couple who decides to have a fourth child has to pay more for their car.  If they did not have a fourth child they would purchase a five-seater car.  There is an additional cost of which we need to be conscious.  However it is the couple's choice to have a larger family.  This is where VRT kicks in.  There is also an issue in terms of motor tax as it penalises those with a seven-seater car because it is structured on CO2 emissions.<\/p><p>  It is clear the motor industry has become environmentally efficient.  Therefore, more than 80% of cars bought in Ireland fall into categories A and B.  However, seven-seater cars do not fall into those categories.  A new Ford Galaxy has a CO2 output of 180 g\/km.  This is the third highest band in VRT.  If one is buying a new Ford Galaxy it will fall into the 30% range for VRT which means families are being penalised in three ways as a result of having to buy a seven-seater car.  First, it costs more to buy a car of equal year, for example, a 2005 car compared to a seven-seater car; second, the rate of motor tax is higher for a seven-seater; and, third, VRT will add to the cost of purchasing the car.  I ask the Minister to look at the scheme.  The danger of reducing a seven-seater car to a lower band is that it might encourage people with no family to drive a seven-seater car for the crack.  That issue has to be protected.  For families who have no option but to buy a seven-seater car something must be done in the areas of VRT and motor tax.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700015#P00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362657600,"counter":869,"content":"<p>We have told the motor trade that we will keep this matter under constant review.

I am not sure how the issue of the seven-seater family car, for families of four children or more, can be addressed because the basis of the taxation is CO2 emissions.  If the CO2 emissions for a seven-seater is the equivalent of the CO2 emissions for another car that is extravagant in terms of CO2 it will have to apply across the band.  I cannot figure how I would address it unless some new criteria were brought in.  If the tax is purely on the basis of CO2 emissions, it is very hard to isolate the area about which the Deputy is concerned, but I will look at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700015#P00400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362657600,"counter":870,"content":"<p>There could be a separate table for cars with more than five seats.

The section itself deals with the flat-rate to farmers and the proposed subsection (2) states: &quot;Where, in relation to a supply of agricultural produce or an agricultural service by a flat-rate farmer, an invoice is issued, that invoice must carry a VAT number and PPS number for moneys claimed against income tax by farmers and farm businesses.&quot;  The amendment is straightforward and aims to ensure that all farm invoices from all farm contracting services carry a VAT number and a PPS number for moneys claimed.

Farmers are not obliged to register for VAT <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> supplies of agricultural produce.  A farmer who is not registered is known as a &quot;flat-rate&quot; farmer and will not have a VAT number.  Under VAT legislation, the invoice or settlement voucher issued for the supply of agricultural produce or services is required to include the full name and address of the flat-rate farmer who supplied the goods or services.  There is no requirement under VAT legislation to include a PPS number on any invoice or similar document issued to a customer.  In general, a flat-rate farmer does not issue an invoice but instead a settlement voucher is issued by the mart or the factory.  Any new rule requiring the inclusion of additional information such as a PPS number on a VAT invoice or settlement voucher would impose an additional administrative burden on these businesses.<\/p><p>  New measures to improve compliance are always being considered and it is important that those measures are proportionate.  Given the potential impact of the proposed amendment on all farmers, including those not providing agricultural services, and on the food industry, careful consideration would have to be given to any such proposal to ensure that it is proportionate to the risk it seeks to address.  My understanding is that this is an issue raised by many contractors in the context of tax compliance and the prevalence of black market activities, as Deputy Doherty has pointed out.  However, this would be a very strong measure to take <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> very small farmers who would be regarded as flat-rate farmers.  It may be a very difficult issue for them and also, on an administrative and bureaucratic basis, difficult to put in place.  There is also an issue in the longer term of how exactly all of this is to be tracked.  That is my initial response to the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700017#R01300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1362658500,"counter":918,"content":"<p>I am no expert in this field but we all have PPS numbers.

The information offered to Deputy Peter Mathews would be interesting because we need to scrutinise these issues to know who benefits from these tax breaks.  The other aspect of interest is that of financial services.  The Minister of State sees this as part of a policy on financial services, an area about which there is a dispute.  I am not suggesting we should have a full-blown debate here, but if it is part of the policy and a planned strategy, in respect of which there is a dispute about the merits of a low tax regime for financial services as being the best way to generate jobs or investment in the State, it would be useful to have a proper debate.  If there is a plan, as the Minister of State says, let us see it.  As Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall asked, what would be the implications?  Have we modelled what might happen if we were to adopt alternatives such as not giving exemptions or, most obviously, the one being debated across Europe, a financial transaction tax?  The Government regularly tells us we must not touch these because investment in the International Financial Services Centre would migrate to Britain.  However, there is no evidence to back this up.  These are important issues for all sides in the debate and we should have evidence to back up the assertions being made.  I question whether, given our low corporation tax rate, a small additional amount of taxation levied on the financial services sector would do as much damage as is sometimes claimed by the Government.  I, therefore, ask it for the evidence.  Perhaps the Minister of State might tell us how we could have an informed debate on the issue.

Under our Presidency, one of the first big decisions made by ECOFIN was to move forward on the issue.  It is a very controversial one with reference to the current position of the industry here which employs 33,0000 people and is worth over &euro;1 billion in payroll and corporation tax returns.  Deputies will be aware that we would not have a difficulty if all 27 member states were to move at the same time to a harmonised tax rate.  This is an aspect of tax law which is very contentious in the European Union.  The dilemma is that if one member state, in this case, the United Kingdom, chooses not to do so, we are in a very vulnerable position.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy asked for evidence.  Some of it is intuitive, while some is based on the stated objectives of some of the biggest firms involved.  We have to be very careful.  It could be argued that the financial services industry here is an offshoot of the industry in London and that changes could potentially have very dangerous effects on the 33,000 jobs provided and the underlying financial base.  It is an open question.  Any decision must be weighed against the potential negative impact on these jobs.

I received a number of representations from the telecommunications sector in respect of section 76.  The sector is concerned that the new provisions under which a charge to stamp duty will arise in circumstances where the holder of an estate or of an interest in land in the State enters into an agreement with another person under which the latter is allowed to carry out development on the land in question and 25% or more of the market value of the land is paid to the landowner could also apply to situations where a telecommunications company enters into a licensing agreement with a landowner for the purpose of, among other things, erecting, installing or maintaining on that land equipment such as masts, poles, antennae, etc.  The landowner would have to receive a payment or payments amounting to 25% or more of the market value of the land concerned in order for the new provisions to apply.  It is not intended that these provisions will apply to such agreements involving the telecommunications sector.  The provisions contained in section 76 are anti-avoidance measures which are designed to counteract certain practices that were formerly prevalent in the construction and development sectors.

These certificates are an aviation-specific form of asset-backed security, that is, security on the aircraft as opposed to the revenue stream.  The established market in EETCs exists in the US and the business relating to it in 2012 amounted to $27 billion.  A full adoption of Alternative A of the Cape Town treaty or equivalent domestic legislation is necessary to ensure the requisite level of security for investors.  Such adoption could enable a discount for borrowers.  The Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are currently progressing heads to adopt conditions equivalent to Alternative A.<\/p><p>  The adoption of provisions equivalent to Alternative A of the Cape Town treaty by Ireland could create the potential to make this country an attractive location for EETC issuance, if completed by appropriate fiscal policy measures.  EETCs are primarily employed in the used aircraft sector.  In view of the fact that banks only have so much capacity at present, it can be difficult for airlines to raise the level of funding required through bank debt alone.  In addition, airlines are increasingly seeking to diversify funding resources.  EETCs enable the financing of older assets, something which is not generally possible by means of bank debt.  In the US market, the aircraft that are financed through the use of EETCs would typically be five to ten years old.  To facilitate the successful issuance of EETCs in Ireland, in addition to the insolvency provisions being examined by the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Transport, Tourism and Sport, an amendment to the stamp duty provisions is required in order to exempt EETCs from such duty, thereby making this form of financing more attractive to investors.<\/p><p>  Ireland is a major global centre for aviation leasing and the host of international registry associations linked with the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment.  In such circumstances, there is a significant opportunity for Ireland to leverage its existing expertise in this area to create new and cheaper sources of funding for Irish airlines and to raise the country's profile as a centre for aviation finance.  This was noted in the report of the aviation business development task force, which was published on 12 November last, and has been included as an action point in the Action Plan for Jobs.  The benefit to the State of what is being done in this instance could be to root our aviation industry more firmly here, enhance the country's attractiveness as an aviation hub and increase revenue streams from trading in the instruments.  Additional jobs should be created, although mostly in the professional services arena.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700020#U02300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1362660300,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>Here we go again.  We already have real estate investment trusts, REITs, investment limited partnerships, ILPs, and now we have enhanced equipment trust certificates, EETCs.  The same logic runs behind all of these, namely, tax breaks for foreign capital supposedly on the grounds that the latter will bring with it jobs and investment.  I am aware of the Government's view on this matter.  It has been quite clearly stated on many occasions.  There is no transparency around these vehicles.  The note in the explanatory memorandum refers to investment limited partnerships, which we have just discussed, and states \"exemptions for the transfer of foreign shares and certain financial services instruments will apply in the case of securitisation transactions\".

We are a big global player in this sector.  One of the key points in the action plan published by the Government some time ago was to develop this sector further.  It is not so much in terms of the employment opportunities although it is indirectly because if we can obtain funds into the country that has an enormous potential in terms of pension funds in particular.  The clarity that is being sought through this provision is something to give what is called \"first mover advantage\" in circumstances where the US already has this in place and other EU countries do not.  Because we have managed to develop this over a pretty significant period of years, money can go in and out very quickly.  I said previously on many occasions that this is a highly privatised, highly deleveraged economy.  One of the ways in which we as a country will come back to growth is by attracting investment into this country and attracting investment in on pensions in circumstances where difficulty in this respect arose in recent years.  This measure provides the potential to do that in terms of giving such certainty.  It is also questionable whether it would apply anyway.  We are putting it in for certainty and for avoidance of doubt in regard to this aspect of funding.<\/p><p>  The IDA is strong on this as well.  We are trying to attract funds into the State across Government, as we have in recent years, but we see this as a potential area across the jobs area.  The idea that this was done with some ulterior motive or some negative connotation is fanciful.  There is a huge opportunity here because of the capacity of funds to attract those funds to this country.  The aviation leasing sector has been significant.  We have no reason to believe that by doing this there is in any way a negative to it.  On the contrary, we think this is significantly positive in terms of assurance that those funds which come into this country and are invested in the aviation leasing area can remain in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700021#V00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1362660900,"counter":1023,"content":"<p>If there is a company such as the one Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned that is not making any active contribution, it is not a matter we should discuss during the passage of the Finance Bill but it is one that we should follow up.

A very small number of people are employed given that those in this business have 3,000 planes available to them at a cost or an asset value of &euro;80 billion.

That is the genuine and legitimate question we should be asking because this is a hugely lucrative industry.

It is a matter for the committee to determine how that dialogue between Revenue and the Department of Finance proceeds.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Doherty's point about a review, in the first instance the review is done in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, but there is an issue for the Department of Finance and Revenue in that.  The issue of review is important because in terms of first mover advantage, I understand there is a market in the United States of approximately $27 billion.  That has got to go somewhere and the question is, where will it go?  We know for a fact that at least one, if not two, European Union countries are looking at this in terms of the potential it provides their industries.  Given that, as Deputy Doherty said, we have built this up over a consistent period of years to the point where we are a major global player in the area, if we do not move and if we do not make it clear that the funds that come here are safe, at some time in the future we could be jeopardising the future development of this sector, which no one wants to see happen.<\/p><p>  In terms of why this is important, it is because, as I understand it, in excess of 24,000 aeroplanes are on order over the course of the coming years.  This is an enormous growth industry, not, as Deputy Doherty said, in terms of the jobs but in terms of the funds.  The funds leverage lots of things we would all like to do in terms of public private partnerships and funds that will become available to shore up the banking sector and the like.  That is why it is important there is certainty around this issue.  The banks do not have the money to lend because they are broken across the European Union and internationally.  They are averse to that kind of risk.  Therefore, routing funds into Ireland for the purposes of this sector, which has developed in recent years, is something that will be significant as a funds industry component.  However, it has never been suggested by Government or anybody else that there is an enormous number of jobs within the industry.  There is the potential to leverage the funds that come into the country for the purposes of the support for the sector, and to leverage the jobs that are required as a result of investment.  It is a classic funds issue.  I do not see a difficulty with the review if that is what the committee believes appropriate, but that review would be in the first instance a Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport related review being fed into on our side in the Department of Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700022#W00700","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1362661500,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>I am not sure it is for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.

It is money that is coming in.  It is 3,000 commercial planes.  Of the &euro;6 billion of exports, in what way is the State benefiting from that?  That is the question I would like answered.

My understanding is that one half of the world's aircraft leasing comes from Dublin, which is an extraordinary and remarkable thing for a small country.  It employs 1,000 people, as Deputy Doherty noted earlier, which is a lot of people.  The ambition is that we will see a major spin-off from that if the section the committee has already passed - section 30 - comes to proper fruition.  Section 30, which was discussed yesterday, deals with the maintenance area and how we grow that.  That is jobs rich.  It is about reconditioning second-hand aircraft and making them fit for purpose again.  My understanding is that of the $27 billion in this area in the US, $19 billion is in what is called the maintenance repair overhaul of aircraft industry.<\/p><p>  The argument we are making is that in order to get the maintenance side up, which is jobs rich and which we know from the figures will be a substantial growth industry, we must be clear about EETCs.  In a sense, one follows the other.  If there is any doubt about that, which is the purpose of the amendment, it could well have a doubt about the potential viability we are all attempting to achieve in section 30, which the Minister set out in his speech and which is part of Government policy.<\/p><p>  The essential point raised by Deputy McGrath is the need to have the information in a way that justifies this.  We can do that and it is up to the Chairman and members how we do that.  In respect of the point raised by Deputy Shortall, it is a good thing in general that we have cost-benefit analysis.  It is right and prudent but it must be proportionate.  I know there was a debate about this yesterday and I understand the Minister made the point I am now going to make.  It is right and appropriate that we would engage in cost-benefit analysis, particularly in significant tax areas.  I know we have given a commitment in respect of research and development.  Given that this is a very competitive area where everyone watches what one is doing, one must use the tax code and system to see if it is possible to develop a niche industry or area of financial services.  In circumstances where there is no money hanging around the place and we need to take in more money, we need to do things differently.  I know this point has been made by the Minister regularly.  On the supply side, we must try to do things differently because we must be ahead of where others will be.<\/p><p>  We have a significant advantage because of the success of the leasing industry, which has been largely driven by a decision taken over a decade ago.  However, we must be conscious that it can go the other way very quickly.  If we see the potential on the maintenance and repair side, which is jobs rich, we need the certainty in respect of EETCs.  We will provide the information, as suggested by Deputy McGrath, and I take his point, which he makes better than I do, in terms of information and review.  This is sensitive because there are many people who would like to get a piece of the pie we have managed to win, which is why we must be careful and do this in a prudent and proportionate way that secures the industry into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700023#X00800","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1362662100,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>This relates to the increase in stamp duty levy applied to health insurance policies.

In the case of new contracts entered into and contracts renewed after 30 March 2013, the rate will be based on the level of cover as well as the age of the insured person.

For example, the due date for the accounting period 31 March 2013 to 30 June 2013 is 21 August 2013.  This levy on health insurers is part of an overall package of risk equalisation measures to ensure the availability of affordable private health insurance.<\/p><p>  I am aware that this was the subject matter of a debate last night and on Tuesday.  I am also aware of concerns about people leaving the schemes.  There is a reality around that.  The key issue for the Government is the question of risk equalisation.  Under the principle of community rating, which all sides of the Oireachtas support, everyone is charged the same premium for health insurance plans irrespective of age, gender, current risk and the likely future state of a person's health.  Community rating means the level of risk a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid.  That is the intention behind the section.  I share Deputy McGrath's concerns, as does everyone, about those who are leaving schemes.  If we are committed to risk equalisation and community rating, we must implement this model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700024#Y00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1362662700,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>People want to know where all of this is heading.  Something will have to give eventually.  The rate of increase in health insurance premium costs is unsustainable and people are not going to continue to be able to afford it, notwithstanding the sacrifices they have been prepared to make to maintain their health insurance cover.  The percentage covered is still relatively high despite the declines in recent years, but I have no doubt that with the introduction of property tax and water charges next year, more and more people will end up dropping out of the system.  If we are trying to get to a point at which there is health insurance for everyone, be it through direct payment by customers or through the State stepping in and providing insurance for those who cannot afford it, we are moving further away from that goal.  That is the difficulty as I see it.  What is the policy to try to bring down health insurance premiums?  If they keep going the way they are going, health insurance will become the preserve of the rich.  More and more people will end up dropping out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700024#Y00300","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1362662700,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>What is required is that we move towards a unified health care system.

The recommendation on the charge is really a policy issue for the Minister for Health.  However, I understand the difficulty we face.

This is a ticking time bomb.  Vast numbers of people are leaving private health insurance or downgrading their cover and it is not sustainable.  We have come very close to a tipping point and action is required.  While we all subscribe to the principle of community rating and risk equalisation, the fact is that the system will collapse unless there is a dramatic change in the model of care.  To suggest that the introduction of universal health insurance will address the problem is incorrect.  In Holland, when universal health insurance was introduced, costs went through the roof.  There must be a cost containment policy and the model of care must be switched so that the bulk of health care is provided at primary level.  The programme for Government provides for that but, unfortunately, it has not happened yet.  I accept the Minister of State's point that these are serious policy matters for the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>  A side issue in the section relates to concerns that have been expressed by the health insurance industry about potential unintended consequences of the legislation.  There is an amendment to section 125(<i>a<\/i>) of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act, subsections (10) and (11) of which provide that people can be required to pay a levy only once per calendar year.  There is a concern that an unintended consequence of the legislation may be that a levy will have to be paid by a person any time he or she changes his or her cover.  People are being encouraged to shop around, and to switch if it is to their benefit, but the concern is that on switching they may be required to pay a new levy.  Industry representatives have been in touch with the Departments of Finance and Health, both of which have been very helpful in this regard and suggested that guidelines could issue to ensure this unintended consequence does not occur.  However, it would comfort the industry if the Minister were to commit on the record to issuing those guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700024#Y00500","speaker":"1178"},{"type":"speech","time":1362662700,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>Deputy Shortall raises an important issue.

That is not much spoken about now because the system is becoming very problematic and unpopular in Holland.  The most developed example of a place where private health insurance companies dominate the provision of health care is the United States.  There is a big financial issue for the State in that the US spends more than any other country in the world on health but 40% of that money is spent on administration because of the predominance of private health insurers competing among themselves and having very developed structures for billing people, essentially gouging money out of people.

In my amendment, which was ruled out of order, there was further scope to lower the thresholds for capital acquisitions tax.  Deputy Mathews mentioned the pressure on people on a daily basis.

While we do not know what is going on in people's heads, there are those who go to certain extremes to make a statement about their dissatisfaction at the way the country is run.  While my amendment has been ruled out of order, there are ways in which to generate more income that can relieve the pressure on individuals in certain areas.  If &euro;225,000 is the amount which a parent can give to a son or daughter, I suggest the amount be reduced to &euro;187,000.  The reason I chose &euro;187,000 is that the average house price in the State is &euro;187,000, therefore it would exempt a father who was transferring a house to a son or daughter in that they would be below the threshold.<\/p><p>  We also know that capital acquisitions tax exempts the family home if the person is living in it.  We are moving in the right direction but a further move in this direction would bring in a substantial amount of money.  As capital acquisitions tax is a wealth tax this is one way we should be looking for additional money.  It is a windfall to somebody, it is unearned income and the thresholds are quite generous.  Given the current environment and the economic situation, where schemes are being cancelled left, right and centre, whether the motorised transport grant, tax on maternity benefit or the telephone allowance for the elderly, this is an area where we can save money which does not impact on people now as it is a windfall they will get in the future.  That &euro;187,000 in category A should be exempt is quite generous.   Many of the thresholds, particularly category A, were always linked to property values.  In the past this threshold was very high but that reflected the high price of property.  I genuinely believe thresholds A, B and C should be reduced further to bring millions of euro into the coffers to provide relief to certain other sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030700026#AA02300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362663900,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>This is a wealth tax as well as the increases in DIRT, CGT and CAT in recent years.

In 2009 the effective tax rate was 20%, then 25%, later 30% and now 33% right across property taxes.  The question is always how much more we can obtain from this area in a circumstance where asking prices have not moved significantly in recent years.  I want to be honest with the Deputy.  We are constantly reviewing the issue and will do so again in the context of next year's budget.  I am a great believer in making sure that any tax change gets more money in rather than lessens the amount.  The whole objective is to get the money in.

They die when they die and the inheritance will pass at that stage.  I am not convinced that not reducing it further will put people off from bequeathing a house or assets to their kin.  While I acknowledge the Minister has moved in a certain direction and it is not the first time it has increased, in recent years it went down to a level that was crazy and should be increased to close to 33% but the thresholds should definitely be reduced.<\/p><p>  The Minister talked about the average house price, I am not sure if the average State wide house price is &euro;187,000 - that may be the Dublin average house price.

Section 40 moved the reference to investment limited partnerships and section 86 is a consequential amendment arising from that.

On 28 February, the national operational plan, regional service plans and hospital group plans were published to ensure that the HSE has a robust planning framework to support the implementation of the national service plan.  These reflect the first full year of implementation of Future Health, a Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Services 2012-2015, which sets out the Government&rsquo;s priorities for the health services.<\/p><p>  The gross current Estimate for the HSE this year is &euro;13.4 billion, a net increase of &euro;71.5 million on the previous year.  However, the reduction required of the HSE in 2013 is &euro;721 million which is a total reduction to HSE budgets since 2008 of &euro;3.3 billion or 22%.  In addition, staff levels have reduced by over 10,000 whole-time equivalents since 2009. <\/p><p>  The scale of the financial challenge continues to be significant in 2013.  Taking account of the budgetary reductions borne by hospitals over the past number of years and the challenge to reduce expenditure at the pace required, the 2013 budgetary allocation process has endeavoured to allocate more realistic hospital budgets with targets that are challenging but attainable.   This rebalancing of hospital budgets is made possible by driving changes in policy and driving further cost efficiencies of &euro;383 million in primary care schemes.  <\/p><p>  The budgetary framework seeks increased income targets of &euro;77 million which requires legislative changes, increased non-pay savings of &euro;43 million and a reduced pay bill of &euro;286 million, primarily linked to measures under the public service agreement.  The measures include implementing changes in rosters and skill mix. <\/p><p>  The 2013 service plan outlines new expenditure of &euro;90 million in respect of demographic pressures experienced by health services and &euro;390 million to address deficits from 2012.  The plan also provides for an investment of an additional 1,025 whole-time equivalents in a number of key prioritised areas.  It will be necessary to achieve a reduction of almost 4,000 WTEs or 4% of the workforce.  The impact of the staff available to deliver front-line services is critical and will be a key issue that will most directly impact on service levels in 2013.  Managing the pay reductions under the public service agreement will also be a primary focus in 2013.<\/p><p>  Regarding acute hospitals, fundamental to the reform agenda is the need to reorganise our hospital resources to ensure patients access appropriate treatment in the right setting, receive the best possible clinical outcomes and provide sustainability for hospital services into the future.  In 2013, specific targets include over 600,000 inpatient activity and over 830,000 day cases; that no adult will wait more than eight months for an elective procedure, either inpatient or day case, by the end of the year; that no child will wait more than 20 weeks for an elective procedure, either inpatient or day case; no person will wait longer than 52 weeks for an outpatient department appointment by the end of year; and 95% of all attendees at emergency departments will be discharged or admitted within six hours of registration.  In addition, when the Government concludes it deliberations and publishes the relevant reports, we will establish hospital groups, implement the small hospitals framework and implement new methods of resourcing in hospitals to drive further efficiencies.<\/p><p>  Regarding the ambulance service, a significant reform programme has been under way in recent years to reconfigure totally the way we manage and deliver pre-hospital care services.  A further &euro;12 million investment will take place in 2013.<\/p><p>  With regard to cancer services, the national cancer control programme will continue to focus on maximising timely access to services and the development of a comprehensive national service.  A &euro;17 million additional provision has been made in 2013 for the increased costs of cancer drugs.  We will see both the launch, which has already occurred, and the continued development of the national colorectal cancer screening programme and the diabetic retinopathy screening programme during 2013.  The latter is not a cancer programme but is managed through the cancer programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013030700003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362649200,"counter":1270,"content":"<p>I remind members that prior to today's meeting, the Primary Care Reimbursement Service issued a comprehensive report on medical cards which together with the agenda and briefing material were sent to members.

The service plan invites such a broad set of responses and covers such a vast area that I will try to focus in on a few issues and seek clarification on them.  We have noted the signalled cut of &euro;721 million to the budget for 2013 and the composite figure of &euro;3.3 billion in cuts since 2008.  I note that in the presentation the witnesses indicated a reduction of &euro;383 million in primary care schemes.  However, if I recall correctly, the breakdown of the &euro;721 million, when it was first signalled, contained a figure for the reduction in primary care expenditure of &euro;323 million.  There seems to be an additional &euro;60 million here.  Is my recall muddied or is there an explanation for that?  Am I correct in pointing up the difference in those figures?  Perhaps I have missed something in the intervening period but it seems that &euro;323 million has grown to &euro;383 million in terms of cuts to primary care schemes.  That must cause serious concern to our friends from the primary care reimbursement service.<\/p><p>  The witnesses also spoke of the composite figure of a &euro;3.3 billion reduction in budget provision as representing a cut of 22%.  They went on to talk about the fact that staff levels have reduced by more than 10,000 whole-time equivalents since 2009, but that obviously does not include the further reduction of 4,000 in the current year.  If we are going to spell it out in terms of the euro and cent impact, we should also have the composite figure expected to apply in the course of this year with regard to staffing.  A 14,000 reduction in whole-time equivalents is alarming.  Is that the full situation?  I ask the witnesses to clarify that point.<\/p><p>  I understand the specific targets that have been set out and hope they are all realisable.  I hope that in looking at this again in 12 months time, we will be looking back and ticking all the boxes, noting that the targets have been achieved.  We only have to put ourselves in the shoes of those awaiting elective procedures to accept that a waiting time of no more than eight months is desirable.  There is a sense that elective procedures are non-emergency procedures.  However, I do not have to go far to come up with real people who were in real pain and anguish but whose treatment was categorised as elective.  It is a fact of life and we are talking about human beings.  Even the eight month guarantee for elective procedures is too long for someone in protracted agony, and I hope that we can do even better than that.  That is not to say I am not mindful of the reality with which the service is contending at this point.  I hope all of these targets are achievable but I believe we should be going much further.<\/p><p>  On the issue of medical cards, I wish to record the fact that Ms McGuinness had a difficult enough meeting with us on Tuesday, following on from the non-consultant hospital doctors, and I would like to share something positive with her.  I acknowledge the continued accessibility and reasonableness of people working in the primary care reimbursement service.  While I will not take off on the Minister's statistics, as read into the record of the D&aacute;il yesterday, Ms McGuinness might like to clarify the position.  The Minister said, with a smile on his face, that there were only nine outstanding medical card applications in the real, quantifiable backlog category.  I am not sure that could be the case because, if it is, they must all be in my back yard and the applicants must all have come to my office.  However, I am not slating the effort because I know people are working very hard to cope.  The Minister has cited, or put on the record, data that do not link up with what we, as elected representatives, know.<\/p><p>  Of the 40,000 people who are signalled to lose their medical cards in the current year, the witnesses have indicated that a certain cohort will be people over 70 years of age.  Will the witnesses explain the criteria and what particular body of people over 70 will lose their entitlement to a medical card?  I presume it is on the basis of income calculations and perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on that.  Will they give us the detail and explain who else, apart from those in the over 70 cohort with a certain income stream, will lose their entitlement to a medical card in the current year?  We need that clarification on the alleged, so-called saving of &euro;20 million.<\/p><p>  My last point relates to the famous &euro;35 million that has popped up again, which somebody pinched out of the back pocket, as it were, of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, last year.  The &euro;35 million is back again and Mr. O'Brien has indicated to us that 307 of the 414 posts have now been filled between the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013.  Could he indicate what posts he is talking about and give us a breakdown of the roles, responsibilities and so forth?  What service providers are we talking about in the profile of the 307 posts?

On the hospital group report, we have not substantially taken the financial impact of hospital groupings into account in the service plan because it is not our expectation that there will be significant yield from that this year.  Our expectation is that Government will conclude its deliberations on that issue in the coming weeks, make its announcement and then assign responsibility for the implementation of groupings to the HSE.  We will take that forward on a group by group basis.  It is logical to expect that the different composition of the groups will create the different dynamics around the process and pace at which they will move.  There will be significant potential benefits of various kinds arising from the groupings.  There is no particular dependency on this in terms of the financial arithmetic for this year.<\/p><p>  The small hospitals framework, which arises from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report, which we refer to as the Ennis-Mallow report, relates to the following hospitals: Louth County Hospital; Our Lady's Hospital, Navan; St. Colmcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown; Bantry General Hospital; Mallow General Hospital and the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Ennis; Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Nenagh; St. John's Hospital, Limerick; and Roscommon General Hospital.  This is primarily an issue of ensuring patient safety arising from the HIQA report rather than one of cost.  There will be other potential benefits arising from full implementation of the small hospitals framework and the groupings, which has a direct bearing on the subject matter discussed by the committee at its meeting on Tuesday, including compliance with the European working time directive, cross-covering in various disciplines and ensuring that the overall resource in a given area, including staff and so on, is used to provide the maximum possible range of services.  For example, in Roscommon General Hospital, which is now part of the Galway-Roscommon University Hospital Group, there have been significant performance and operational benefits arising from the creation of this group.  We have also seen a significant increase in the level of activity at that hospital following the changes which occurred there the year before last.  The hospital is busier in terms of day cases and so on.  These are the types of changes we expect to emerge.  There are dependencies but these are not service plan financial dependencies.  We keenly await the outcome of the deliberations so that we can give effect to these proposals before the end of the year.<\/p><p>  On medical cards, I will ask my colleague to address the detailed mechanics of that process.  The target is 40,000.  There are some policy determinations yet to be made and provided to us, which will cover the detail in that regard.  We expect to have those relatively soon.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013030700006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1362650400,"counter":1285,"content":"<p>Will that policy determination come from the Minister and Department of Health?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013030700006#E00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362650400,"counter":1286,"content":"<p>Yes.

It is being held centrally precisely because the various options that could emerge from Croke Park II will affect how it is distributed.  Although what happens will change the gross and net figures for any particular service, it will have a broadly neutral affect on the service itself in that it will be a reduction of cost associated with whatever is ultimately agreed.

This is not how we would expect it to turn out.  There will be a natural rate of turnover, probably accounting for between 1,000 and 1,400 staff based on a typical cycle.  Members will be aware that a voluntary exit scheme is being prepared, which will have an impact on the total numbers leaving.  An exit of 4,000 will be required if we are to comply with our employment control framework and create the headroom for the additional posts we need to create.  We will have to closely monitor this process, which is in its relatively early days.  Some of the matters about which we spoke earlier will have an impact on it.<\/p><p>  On Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point regarding the difference between the &euro;323 million and &euro;383 million, the figure of &euro;323 million is identified on page 3, table 2 of the service plan.  It was an Estimates day issue.  At the bottom of page 4, under community demand-led schemes it states: \"The HSE board has made a decision to introduce additional cost reductions in PCRS beyond those specified in the Estimates.  In so doing, the HSE will seek &euro;60 million of further target reductions in expenditure through a range of efficiency measures detailed in table 5\".  We believe it is possible to reduce costs in areas such as medicines management and so on and have set a target of &euro;60 million in this regard, which we believe is realisable.  The &euro;323 million essentially relates to the impact of the IPHA deal, various eligibility changes and the impact of the increase in co-payments, which impact on the cost rather than level of care provided.  On the question of the impact on those aged over 70 years, a policy decision was made by the Government to reduce the income criteria for those aged over 70 years.  While previously the qualifying income criteria for a single person was &euro;700 per week and for a couple was &euro;1,400, this has been reduced to &euro;600 and &euro;1,200 per week, respectively.  That is how people aged over 70 years will be impacted.  <\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that an eight month target, while a significant improvement on the two and three year wait evident up to two years ago, is still a lengthy waiting period.  This is a target beyond those classified as clinically urgent.  Such persons can, left untreated, have significant debilitating and life altering conditions.  Clearly, this is another step towards reducing waiting times further.  The primary target list which started out at 12 months was reduced to nine months and now stands at eight months.  We hope to achieve this year's target and to use it as a platform for reducing the target further so that we get to a normative situation in due course whereby persons could expect to be treated within three or four months, as would be the case in neighbouring jurisdictions.  I agree with the Deputy's points in this regard.  While it may be classified as elective it does not mean it is in any sense trivial or non-urgent: it is.  My colleague will address the Deputy's questions on medical cards.  <\/p><p>  In terms of mental health, Appendix 3 of the service plan, which is set out on page 3, details the level of expenditure and number of posts, totalling 477, to be allocated this year to different areas of mental health services.  It is important to stress that while primarily due to the lag in recruitment last year the &euro;35 million was not spent on development posts, that &euro;35 million has been restored and added to by a further &euro;35 million.  As such, in-year additional resources for these developments is &euro;70 million. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013030700007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1362651000,"counter":1290,"content":"<p>There will be two tranches of &euro;35 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013030700007#F00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362651000,"counter":1291,"content":"<p>Yes, both of which will be spent this year.  One of the challenges faced by the HSE this time last year was the interplay between the new posts and the challenge of reducing its overall head count.  This led to a delay in seeking to achieve the head count reduction prior to implementation of the service plan and Government priorities for the new development posts.  We have turned that around this year.  We are proceeding with new development posts in advance of achieving the head count reduction which is, it must be said, a risk but a necessary one if we are to achieve the objectives of the service plan - the risk being that we will put in these new posts and miss the overall reduction target.  It is a calculated decision.<\/p><p>  On orthopaedic appointments, about which Deputy Healy made a valid point, there is a particular problem in this area.  The Deputy referred to Waterford Regional Hospital where the waiting time for an orthopaedic appointment on an outpatient basis is unacceptably high.  The hospital is benefiting from the clinical programme relating to orthopaedics, including musculoskeletal physiotherapists, which is having an impact.  To reduce the overall quantum, a number of patients have been taken off the back of the waiting list at Waterford Regional Hospital and taken to other hospitals.  The reality is that the waiting list for orthopaedic appointments at Waterford Regional Hospital, which had stretched out to four years in some instances, had reached the point where it had become unmanageable.  A number of measures have been taken to address this, although the situation is not yet fully under control or where it needs to be.  The Deputy's point that such lengthy waiting periods is unacceptable is well made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013030700007#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1362651000,"counter":1292,"content":"<p>The point made by Deputy Healy was also made at the briefing in Cork on Monday.

Regarding the current control framework and the sharing of data between the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection, what type of legislation is pending and can the witnesses assure people that they will protected under the Data Protection Act?  I am happy to hear that the National Adult Literacy Agency is involved in the revision of application forms and letters and I ask the witnesses to elaborate on how successful the effort to make application forms more user-friendly has been.<\/p><p>  According to the presentation, there has been a 74% increase since 2005 in the number of people who are eligible for a range of health services covered by the GP visit cards.  How does the HSE plan to address the issue of growing demand at a time of limited funding?  The witnesses also mentioned that there will be a reduction of 40,000 in the numbers holding full medical cards.  What eligibility criteria will be used?  Is the HSE planning to lower the income threshold for qualification, bearing in mind that many people have far less money in their pockets now?  <\/p><p>  The standard medical cards are relatively easy to get but it is still very difficult to obtain emergency medical cards.  There are also enormous problems pertaining to the discretionary medical cards where, for example, people who would have been approved for medical cards on discretionary grounds are quite often only given a GP visit card once their discretionary card comes up for review.  They then have to go through the process of applying for a discretionary card all over again.  Such people are presenting to our constituency offices and explaining that they are not taking their prescribed medication because they have been issued with GP visit cards and cannot afford to fill their prescriptions.  Another concern in this regard is the difficulty for cancer patients in obtaining discretionary medical cards.  I have found, through my constituency office, that many such patients are being refused discretionary medical cards.  The HSE might argue that their income is above the medical card threshold but that does not take into account the true cost for people of dealing with cancer.  People with young children, for example, need to pay for additional child care and in some instances, also need help with cooking and general housework because they are so ill and are in bed for weeks on end.  It costs money to buy take-away food on occasion, to travel to and from hospital, to park one's car at hospitals and so forth.  Such expenses over a 12-month period can add up and I do not think such issues are being taken into consideration.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of orthopaedics, I have been told by several people that they have been waiting for up to four years for treatment.  People are put on a waiting list for the waiting list, so to speak.  When the HSE representatives talk about reducing waiting lists, are they talking about one list or all of the other lists along the way?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013030700009#H00300","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1362652200,"counter":1329,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Brien and his team.  The service plan is essentially about delivery of services.  While I welcome what was said about the mental health budget and the ring-fencing of the &euro;35 million, what reassurance can we be given that the service plan for the mental health sector will be implemented this year?  Has the recruitment of staff allocated under the service plan started?  We will be at the end of the first quarter within a few weeks.  Last year many of us asked questions about this throughout the year and were constantly told that the staff would be in place \"within the next few months\" but they were not in place by year end.  I am very concerned about this because the target for the child and adolescent mental health services is that no-one will wait more than 12 months for an appointment.  A year is a very long time to wait for a first appointment for a child or an adolescent experiencing mental health difficulties.  All too often I am hearing of cases where a child is waiting nine months, is given an appointment but is then told he or she is with the wrong specialty.  The child then goes to the back of another queue.  So, while the target of less than one year has technically been met, the child's needs have not been met.<\/p><p>  I am also very concerned about the waiting lists for those suffering from pre-natal and post-natal depression.  The birth of a new baby is supposed to be a time of joy but women are being told they will have to wait nine to 12 months before they can access expert mental health services.  The weeks and months following birth are the critical time for bonding with one's child and in that context, I am very concerned about the delays in that area.  <\/p><p>  We have had good discussions in this committee about the child and family support agency and we await the legislation.  However, I am reminded of the warning in tube stations in London to \"mind the gap\".  We are in a \"mind the gap\" phase now, or a transition period.  All of the services are currently under the auspices of the HSE and all of the accountability for them rests with the HSE.  I ask the witnesses to clarify whether the CEO designate of the new agency reports to the HSE at present.  The main objective listed under the child and family support services is child protection but child and family support is about much more than just child protection.  I would like to see references to other outcomes for child and family services.  The other mind the gap concern I have relates to the transition period between childhood and adulthood.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of the money following the patient, the witnesses spoke about hospital groupings but have they considered patient groupings, such as children with life-limiting conditions?  This is a very specific grouping of children for whom a money follows the patient model could be initiated very quickly.  This is what their parents want, it would be good for the children and could save us money in the longer term.  Has any consideration been given to this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013030700009#H00500","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1362652200,"counter":1330,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

I appreciate the witnesses coming here this morning.  I would like to be associated with Deputy Maloney's comments.  As politicians both here in committee and in the media we are nearly always very critical and it is really nice to see a change management programme which evolved last year having such a successful outcome.  I congratulate the witnesses on that.  I am somebody who is genuinely interested in the delivery of health services but I am new to it.  Considering the change management done by the wider team in the Department of Health and the HSE over the past year, there have been massively improved outputs, and all while we are losing staff and money.  It is a credit to everybody here and I thank the witnesses for that.<\/p><p>  The question I have is not about the service plan as the issue is not in the plan.  Will the witnesses comment on the umbrella of health and well-being programmes?  Do they see any benefit to extending the remit of the pharmacy sector, particularly around proactive measures regarding community services in the health and well-being sector?  It would be great news if this was already done.  I have a concern that since we increased the dispensing rate - I accept our Government has done this - people are self-medicating and going into pharmacists on a weekly and monthly basis but leaving items off their list without fully recognising what they are doing or the impact on their health.  Is there a benefit in employing, empowering, asking, engaging or paying the pharmacy sector to be more involved?

At the end of last year we put in place some change management arrangements for that group of hospitals and in the intervening period, we have seen some significant improvements in the access position of the hospital, particularly with trolleys.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital was a facility that would keep a person awake at night because of some of the 8 a.m. trolley counts but we have seen significant improvement there.  The Louth-Meath hospital group will form part of a wider group in the development plan, and one of the purposes of those groups is to give devolved decision-making around the appropriate distribution of services between hospitals rather than issues always being decided at the centre.  I know the hospital or group management team for this are examining the appropriate distribution of services across the available sites.  Although that will progress, I do not have any information that I can share today, unfortunately, other than recognising there has been some early benefit and a significant degree of ambition by the local management team to continue that.  I am confident that will happen.<\/p><p>  There was a question on the ambulance service investment, which is a very important area of development.  This is particularly pertinent with regard to intermediate care vehicles, which enable a much more responsive and dynamic flow.  There is also the centralisation of control, which has significant benefits.  There was a question on the ongoing occasional problem of ambulances being delayed because of issues in accident and emergency departments.  It has not yet gone away but one of the reasons for the investment in intermediate care vehicles is that sometimes there are problems of egress and access in the same hospital.  Beaumont Hospital was mentioned as an example.  At times, it would have ambulances held seeking to get in patients while at the same time being unable to obtain transportation services to get patients out who would be going to a referring hospital or to another place of care.  The intermediate care vehicle strategy is a central part of that process and it will, in turn, speed up the general turnover within a hospital and make accident and emergency departments more effective.  Investment in ambulances and intermediate care vehicles is vital to the overall efficiency, and it is a particular issue in some of the big Dublin hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013030700010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1362652800,"counter":1334,"content":"<p>Could Mr. O'Brien explain what he means by intermediate care vehicles?

It is a carefully sequenced extraction process.  We would not want the view to develop that the HSE is no longer in the child care business because it is.  The focus of child protection is appropriately moving to the new agency but the HSE will still provide a vast range of services to the benefit of children and needs to be appropriately organised for that.  We have someone working on this process.<\/p><p>  At this stage we are preparing for the full roll-out of money follows the patient.  In that context we are not piloting any new areas.  We will be seeking to move swiftly in line with the publication by the Department of Health two and a half weeks ago of a survey strategy and discussion paper in regard to money follows the patient.  We will be seeking to move wholesale towards that in shadow form and then in full form as quickly as practical thereafter and there will be benefits that arise from it.   Not every type of health service will be amenable to money follows the patient.  That will emerge as we go through the process.<\/p><p>  In terms of the cost of drugs, there are a number of key issues here, one of which is legislative in terms of reference pricing, sometimes referred to as reference pricing 1 and 2.  The full benefit will flow in due course from reference pricing.  At present we have a medicines management programme in place which will address also the issue of how best to interface the pharmacy sector in this issue.  We know that our rate of generic prescribing by comparative standards is very low and we also know that there would be a significant economic benefit if that rate were to be increased and the medicines management programme is focused on that.  Reference pricing would add to the value of that but there is significant to be obtained even in advance of that legislation.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of waste, I am sure there is no limit to the number of individual examples of less than ideally efficient practice.

I thank Senator Crown for raising the issue of rehabilitation medicine, a subject very close to my heart.  In the rehabilitation medicine programme there is a plan to develop managed clinical networks in the four regions as they currently stand.  I am glad to report that five rehabilitation medicine consultant posts have just been approved in the consultant appointments committee and I hope we will soon advertise for those posts.  There will be an extra ten beds staffed at the National Rehabilitation Hospital and although in terms of specialist inpatient rehabilitation beds that still falls significantly short of what is required for the population it is a significant development.  With the new rehabilitation medicine consultant posts going into the regions the intention is that there will be a development of four inpatient and ambulatory units for the management of neurological and other disabling conditions which will be an excellent development.  It is likely with the work being done to look at the development of major trauma centres that there will be an increased need for specialist inpatient and outpatient and, obviously, community services, as the sustaining  services are incredibly important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013030700011#K01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362654000,"counter":1357,"content":"<p>I apologise to the delegates but there is a vote in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013030700012#L00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1362654300,"counter":1359,"content":"<p>I apologise to the witnesses for the delay.

The HSE, the special delivery unit, SDU, the clinical directors, the RDOs and the hospital group chief executive officers are working together in an examination of all aspects of unscheduled care.

If I might use the phrase, I think they themselves made something of a meal of it.  Each year the HSE spends approximately &euro;32 million on food product expenditure.  Some 73% of that represents fresh food product such as fresh meat, poultry, pork, bacon, fish, etc., fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy products and fresh bread.  The standard sought from tenders is that they should reach at a minimum the An Bord Bia quality assurance programme or an equivalent quality assurance scheme.  Some 20% of it represents ambient or dried products, which would include cereals, pasta, preserves, beverages such as tea and coffee, cooking products, flour, grains, etc., and 7% represents frozen food products supplementing fresh produce.  Some 4% would include products such as ice cream, poultry and frozen vegetables, which also carry nutritional value.  The remaining 3% refers to processed food, which would include such products as were the subject of that newspaper report - pizza, sausage rolls, burgers, etc.  Therefore, approximately 3% of the total food purchased annually is in that category.  The contract that was referenced relates to HSE west and nine counties, and the food there would not only be for patients but for staff and visitors.<\/p><p>  In a rounded sense, while the HSE, in common with other health promoting entities, would seek to encourage all to minimise their individual consumption of processed foods for a variety of reasons, it still remains the case that there is a requirement to provide persons with a degree of choice and an ability to make decisions for themselves.  To put it in context, while one might have expected that we were force-feeding burgers and sausage rolls to the entire country, the total procurement in HSE west would amount to no more than approximately 30 burgers a day or no more than approximately 18 frozen pizzas a day which, in the context of the numbers we feed, as I think the committee will agree, is very small.<\/p><p>  The other point is that many, in a point in their lives, become long-term residents of a HSE facility and we would not wish to be placed in a position of being directed to say to them that they will never again be able to enjoy in an appropriately informed way some of the foods that have been part of their nutritional lives, be that the occasional undesirable battered sausage or battered cod fillet.  We seek to provide choice.  All resident inpatients have a choice menu.  Where it is appropriate for their particular circumstances, dietary advice is given.  We seek to promote choices that are healthy and balanced.  It is not unreasonable for 3% of the food to be in that category.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013030700014#N01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1362654600,"counter":1375,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien for the clarification.

This committee simply wants to ensure that they do so without impacting adversely on people's individual rights.  <\/p><p>  We look forward to hearing from social media companies today on the safeguards that currently exist both on Facebook and Twitter.  In particular, we wish to explore what systems currently exist both for users and non-users of Facebook and Twitter, who feel they have been wronged, to uphold their individual rights through these channels.  <\/p><p>  Given that social media is changing the way in which many citizens interact with one another, we thought it was important for the committee to familiarise itself with the topic, particularly in light of disquiet, which has been expressed in some quarters, that there are no curbs on the irresponsible use of these channels.  We want to explore how possible policies can be put in place to increase awareness of cyber bullying and to enhance accountability for the minority who abuse on-line channels.  <\/p><p>  As well as hearing the views of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and the office of Internet safety, we will also hear from the National Anti-Bullying Coalition and YouTube.  Furthermore, we have invited written submissions via social media channels from interested groups and individuals.

However, I am delighted to be present to talk to members about Twitter.  I propose to first answer the basic question as to what is Twitter.  While many members use Twitter, some do not and it is important to lay the groundwork for the discussion.  I then propose to discuss for a little bit why and how the vast majority of people use Twitter and then talk to members about our commitment to ensuring the experience of those who use Twitter is positive, enriching and safe, as well as the steps we take and resources we put in place to ensure this.<\/p><p>  I will do this via a presentation because, as they say, a picture tells a thousand words.  In essence, Twitter is a public communications platform.  At its heart, Twitter effectively is built around small bursts of information, which we call tweets.  Each one of those tweets can be no more than 140 characters long.  It is similar to a text message and that was the genesis of the concept.  In addition to text within these tweets, one can have photographs, videos, links to news stories and people can converse on Twitter and have an interaction between one other.  The most important point is that users control their experience on the platform.  They choose who to follow and what they wish to see.  Moreover, they can indicate right at the outset if there are certain types of information they do not wish to see.<\/p><p>  As for the company's position from a worldwide perspective, it now has 200 million active users worldwide.  As members can see from the slide, the vast majority of that growth has taken place in the past two or three years.  The company itself actually is quite small and literally is growing into the product and what the platform has become.  Our headquarters is in San Francisco, while our international hub and EMEA headquarters is located here in Dublin and I am part of an ever-expanding team here.  As I noted, it is evident that the real growth has taken place within the past three years.  To put this in perspective, it took three years, two months and one day for Twitter to reach the one billionth tweet.  We now turn over and see 1 billion tweets every two and a half days.  This demonstrates the growth in the volume of information that is being shared on the platform.  More than 60% of Twitter use is conducted on mobile telephones, while 70% of our users are outside of the United States and members can see the pockets of activity on the slide on display.  Twitter increasingly is available in a range of languages and we are ever-expanding that agus t&aacute;im f&iacute;or-bhr&oacute;d&uacute;il go bhfuil Gaeilge ann fresin.<\/p><p>  There are many ways in which people use Twitter and a significant percentage of our users do not tweet at all.  They use Twitter to listen to and see what other people are talking about in their own areas of interest.  They are receiving, rather than producing information.  I heard a lot of talk yesterday about the role Twitter now plays in politics and, clearly, it has been embraced at many levels of government worldwide.  The slide on display shows a selection of some of the Heads of State and Government who now are on Twitter and who use it on a daily basis.  Here in Ireland, the website <i>merrionstreet.ie<\/i> is very active in communicating messages and initiatives on the part of the Government, while the Opposition political parties are also highly active in this regard.  It has proved to be a highly effective way of democratising government and humanising large institutions as well as enabling them to engage and converse with citizens on many different levels.  In this context, none more so than the European Union, which traditionally citizens would have found to be inaccessible, but the Commission, the Council and the Parliament itself now actively use Twitter to reach out.<\/p><p>  I will move on to why and how the vast majority of people use Twitter.  Fundamentally they use it to connect to other people.  They perceive it to be a fast and easy way to communicate with or simply listen to other people.  Some connect to people they know while a great number of people decide to connect or listen to people they do not know but who they admire or in whom they are interested or about whose sphere of activity they wish to learn more.  This goes right across the range of human endeavour.  They may be interested in food, music, sport or subjects right across the vast areas of human interest.  To give members some examples, some from here in Ireland include Rachel Allen, Maria Doyle Kennedy and, of course, as I must look after the home town, the Cork hurler D&oacute;nal &Oacute;g Cusack.  Members can see the range and variety and the key point is if one is not interested in rugby and is only interested in hurling, one can just see information about hurling.  One can choose one's experience and who it is from whom one wishes to hear on the platform.<\/p><p>  Similarly, people come to Twitter for information, particularly information pertaining to real-time events.  This has proved to be immensely valuable across a number of key areas.  For example, police services are highly active on Twitter right across the world because they perceive it to be a means of communicating directly with citizens both in emergencies and to give information about incidents that have occurred in a particular area, such as, for example traffic updates.  We also see amazing and innovative use of Twitter in education and health, as well as by non-governmental organisations.  Again, it is easier to illustrate this point with examples.  Obviously, I am particularly familiar with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na account<i>, <\/i>@GardaTraffic, which tweets information in and around major events to ensure people are aware of what is happening in a locality when something is happening.  The account, @aaroadwatch, is a commercial equivalent and indicates to people what is going on in their areas on an hourly basis, minute by minute.  The middle example on the slide, if members can see it, shows a history class in County Tipperary, where the teacher has chosen-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad McSweeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1362648600,"counter":1399,"content":"<p>Ms McSweeney has the Chairman's attention now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700003#B00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1362648600,"counter":1400,"content":"<p>She always had it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700003#B00500","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1362648600,"counter":1401,"content":"<p>He will be on Twitter before the night is out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700003#B00600","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362648600,"counter":1402,"content":"<p>It is absolutely fascinating.  The teacher here has chosen to have that class tweet the Norman invasion or the Second World War to make it real to them, as well as to cover the subject on a platform with which they are familiar.  I had an interesting conversation with Orla Tinsley recently about how cystic fibrosis sufferers cannot have the normal support group environment to which many other people have access because of the risk of infection.  I was talking to her about a tweet I had seen from someone to the effect that Twitter provided for this person the equivalent of a support group.  It was where she felt she could talk to and share her experiences, worries and issues with people, albeit in a safe environment because she was not at risk of infection.  Similarly, a lot of mental health organisations use Twitter and other social media to access the groups with whom they are trying to raise awareness of mental health issues and to offer a helping hand and a listening ear.  They have found it to be highly effective.  Again, in respect of straightforward Government information, I have included on the slide examples from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Fingal County Council, which has used the platform really effectively, particularly on foot of events such as flooding two years ago and so on.  Again, it involved simply giving people the information they require when they need it, right at the moment.  Finally, people come to Twitter to connect to and be part of events.  It could be the run-up to the hurling and football championships in September, as well as every other game and moment that happens in between.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700003#B00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad McSweeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362649800,"counter":1405,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McSweeney for that very detailed and comprehensive overview.

As a company, in conjunction with many youth organisations and Internet safety organisations, we are anxious to push the debate into that space, particularly with young people. We take our children into the world at a young age, be it to a restaurant, to school or to visit relatives, and we expect a certain standard of behaviour from them.

One of the solutions to this problem is to have all the stakeholders work together to avoid a scenario where the type of legislative or Government-imposed restrictions the Deputy describes are required.  We need to develop a better understanding of the tools and resources that are available outside of legislation and try to avoid circumstances where incidents escalate to the point of becoming a criminal offence.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that the Deputy should ask what actions are triggered when one makes a complaint.  We have found that young people also ask this question because they are anxious to have greater transparency about the process of making a complaint.  Twitter is working on this issue.  Young people expressed a concern that if they were to report someone who was sending abusive information or making offensive comments, this report could be sent to the individual about whom they are complaining.  We need to introduce some transparency around this process and provide reassurance.  When someone chooses to report offensive contact, which is, as the Deputy stated, insidious, persistent and abusive behaviour, such complaints are assessed by our trust and safety team against Twitter rules.  Where someone has violated Twitter rules, he or she is suspended from the platform.  This can and does happen to people who violate our rules.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to protocol and procedures.  In effect, he was insisting that people use their real names and raising the issue of anonymity on the platform.  There is a flipside to the anonymity debate.  We view anonymity as giving people who would not otherwise have a voice an opportunity to be part of discussions and debates and perhaps a world that is not generally open to them.  As a platform founded on the principle of freedom of expression, the anonymity concept is very important to us.  We have seen it used and it is of immense value to people around the world, be they dissident journalists working in areas of conflict, human rights workers or young people in particular at-risk groups.  These are the reasons anonymity is important to Twitter as a platform.  That said, the issue the Deputy raises is a serious one, although his example involving him masquerading as Enda Kenny may not be so serious.  Some of the speech that can occur anonymously is a serious problem and I assure the Deputy that regardless of whether they are made anonymously, tweets must still conform to our rules.  If anonymous tweets or accounts are reported to us and found to violate our rules, they will be suspended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad McSweeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1362650400,"counter":1418,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms McSweeney and thank her for her presentation.

The idea that we are even discussing interfering in the freedom to express one's thoughts and ideas does not sit comfortably.  Twitter and social media are not the main issue because what one sees online is essentially what one sees off-line.  In terms of what is legal and illegal, social media mirror life.<\/p><p>  I concur with Ms McSweeney on the issue of anonymity.  For hundreds of years, some of our greatest writers used pseudonyms and no one challenged that.

That is where our basic problem lies.  If something is printed in a newspaper about one or put up on Twitter, unless one has substantial amounts of money at one's disposal, one cannot go to the Four Courts.  We can have all of the policies, practices and procedures in place that we want but it is not realistic to expect, for example, that on the back of a billion tweets, every account can be deleted.  A more realistic approach would be to try to make our courts service more reflective of today's society.  People need to have access to the courts and for me, that is the nub of this debate rather than whether we need to take a nanny-State approach.<\/p><p>  I am reminded of an episode of &quot;Father Ted&quot;, where two people are outside a cinema shouting, &quot;Down with this sort of thing&quot;.  I know this is a very serious issue but there is a temptation here to put the spotlight entirely on the wrong area.  If people are trying to vindicate their good name in the face of something said about them in print, on the radio or in social media, the actual medium is not the problem but the difficulty of accessing the court system.  <\/p><p>  Does Twitter have a corporate responsibility fund or a social fund to raise awareness of these issues?  Is there a voluntary code of conduct in place between Twitter and other companies and providers?  Is there any engagement by Twitter with some of the stakeholders dealing with younger people?<\/p><p>  I draw the committee's attention to an article published in last Monday's <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>, which quotes a spokesperson from the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals as follows: &quot;The social networks ought to have a dedicated liaison officer whose job it is to take calls from schools and parents and act promptly in deleting offensive posts&quot;.  Does Ms McSweeney have any comment to make on that?<\/p><p>  In general, in terms of where this committee is going with this issue, we should be talking to the Department of Justice and Equality, the Bar Council, the Law Society and others and finding out why it is so expensive to take a case in the Four Courts to clear one's name.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700008#G00300","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1362651600,"counter":1433,"content":"<p>That is a good point but we outlined our criteria earlier on in this process and we know where we are going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700008#G00400","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1362651600,"counter":1434,"content":"<p>We know now where we are going but for the future, we must consider this also.

We have clear rules as to what is and is not permitted on the platform.  There are limitations to the content that can be published.  The publication of content which breaches our rules, including specific, direct threats of violence, abusive behaviour, posting somebody's private information and impersonation, leads to suspension.  We have also developed a technology which allows us to block content in countries where the content may be illegal in that country but not elsewhere.  So, for example, in Germany, certain types of Nazi speech is illegal.  It might only be considered offensive elsewhere but because it is illegal in Germany it is blocked in Germany if reported to us and the user sees a greyed-out box.  Therefore, the content is not just blocked but people know and understand why it is blocked.  That is an important part of educating people about what is acceptable, unacceptable, legal and illegal.<\/p><p>  In terms of the press council idea, I am not sure how something like that might work.  Again, I would direct people to the resources that are already there, that all social media companies have actually put in place.  I was struck by the debate both yesterday and this morning in terms of the work we must do to highlight some of the incredible resources that we have put time, energy and experience into developing.  We definitely need to do some work on that.  <\/p><p>  Deputy O'Mahony asked about the extent to which we have found ourselves modifying our policies and procedures.  We constantly modify them and look for feedback on them.  We work with other organisations in the space and seek feedback from parent's groups, teachers, various safer internet centres around the world and modify our procedures accordingly.  I spoke earlier about having more transparency around the way in which we deal with reports, for example.  Members also asked about the timeline on reports.  The reality is that it varies widely.  If we get a report about an impersonation, for example, we must be very sure that the report is coming from the appropriate person and is not an effort by somebody else to take on that person's identity.  In reply to the question, the response time depends on the nature of the report or complaint because there are certain verification steps which we need to go through.<\/p><p>  Members spoke about bullying and the extent to which it may be silent online.  There is an alternative view that in some ways, it should actually be more visible.  It should actually be easier for young people to prove or illustrate to others that they are being bullied because they can capture it.  It is there, online, for others to see.  What we need to do - and this is something we are working on - is empower young people to break their silence and talk about what is happening to them.  In some ways, the bullying should be far more visible and detectable but we must empower people and give them the skills to reach out when they have a problem.  That leads me in to Deputy O'Donovan's question about corporate responsibility.  We actually have a programme called Tweets for Good.  On the recent Safer Internet Day, we facilitated safer internet messaging throughout the day on the platform, as if it was an advertisement on the platform.  It was given a particular prominence and targeted at those who needed it most.  We work with charities and voluntary organisations to enable them to use the platform in an effective way.  We also work in a more informal way on these issues.  Some of the more skilled marketing people on the team and myself have met with some of the mental health awareness organisations and young people's organisations in Ireland to talk about how they use Twitter and how they can use it even more effectively to communicate their message.  We are doing quite a lot of work in that area.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Donovan also made reference to the need for a dedicated liaison officer for schools and parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700008#G00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad McSweeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1362651600,"counter":1437,"content":"<p>It was raised in an article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700008#G00800","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362651600,"counter":1438,"content":"<p>Sorry, the issue was raised in a newspaper article.

I also apologise if some of my comments and questions are repetitive.  An important lesson I have learned since starting to use Twitter three years ago is to have my own set of rules and engagement with Twitter.  It can be a compulsive form of communication.  As the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, said yesterday, it is about emerging best practice.  As a parent, one of the challenges is to remind teenagers that Twitter is not like texting.  Certain teenagers use Twitter as if it were a private conversation.  The public-private issue is a challenge for parents and we must consider it.<\/p><p>  We must also deal with the difference between criticism and abuse.  Dealing with criticism on Twitter can be tough, and something may appear abusive if one reads it at 10 p.m. but the following morning it may not seem as bad.  As a user, one must develop self-regulation and not answer quickly or ignore something.  I have received regular systematic tweet after tweet.  What does one do?  Does one ignore it?  If one is seen as a public figure, does one block it?  What does \"blocking\" mean?  I apologise if this has already been explained when I was not here, but I would like the witness to explain the process of blocking.  If I block someone, does the person I have blocked know this?  Does it allow the person to come back in a different way?  If teenagers or young people using Twitter decide to block somebody, does the person who has been blocked know this?  I would like the witness to explain the sequence.  One of my rules is to ignore being bombarded by someone with no followers.  Does the witness have any statistics on blocking Irish Twitter accounts on a daily or weekly basis?<\/p><p>  Understanding anonymity is a challenge for the committee.  As Ms McSweeney stated, anonymity in itself can provide an opportunity for people to be more expressive or more honest.  The challenge is with regard to anonymity and authenticity.  Anonymity has been described as an enabling tool to enter dialogue and debate, but the essence and attraction to Twitter is authentic voices, diverse opinions and a safe place to dialogue.  There is a moment at which anonymity becomes abusive, because one cannot engage on an ongoing basis on Twitter with somebody who is completely anonymous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700009#H00500","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1362652200,"counter":1444,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McSweeney for a very helpful presentation.  She stated that Twitter should be positive, enriching and safe and I agree with this.  She showed how young people use Twitter to learn, and mentioned a history class in Tipperary.  It is good to hear these examples.  How young are Twitter users?  We tend to think of Twitter as more for older users and Facebook more for teens.  Does Ms McSweeney have data on the Irish population?<\/p><p>  I wish to discuss corporate social responsibility.  Based on what I hear from teachers and parents, they would appreciate a helpline in Ireland.  This helpline might be funded by all of the social media and not just by Twitter.  When parents, teachers and counsellors, including mental health counsellors, have a concern they want a quick response but after e-mailing, they often find help is not forthcoming from the social media provider.  Ms McSweeney mentioned a hotline in the UK.  Who funds this hotline?  Would Twitter consider being a part funder of a hotline here?<\/p><p>  We all want the content being posted to be safe for young people and children.  Deputy Colreavy spoke about the damage that is likely and may have been done to some young people.  We cannot dismiss this or say it did not happen.  Does Twitter moderate content or does it completely rely on self-reporting?  I understand almost 1 billion tweets are sent within a three-day period.  With regard to Twitter completely relying on self-reporting, not everybody is as enabled or as aware as Ms McSweeney explained to us today.  What can Twitter do to educate people above and beyond the helpline it already provides?<\/p><p>  How quickly does Twitter intervene when inappropriate content is brought to its attention?

I have answered the question about the age at which a child is allowed on Twitter.  The child must be over 13 years old.  In addition, when they are signing up it is possible for any Twitter user to indicate that they do not wish to see certain material.  There is a box one can tick to say one does not wish to see sensitive content.  My advice to parents is to recognise that they have to know and understand the tools and channels that their children are using.  We, as parents, do not have the luxury of saying: \"It is too much, the whole thing has moved away too fast so I give up\".<\/p><p>  My son is four years old.  He is already probably better on the iPhone and iPad than I am.  I have the advantage of working for a social media company, so I know and understand it.  However, I have to think of the future and wonder how the world will be when he reaches 13, 14 and 15 years of age.  Last week, I signed up for an online coding course so that when he starts talking Java and HTML to me in a couple of years, I will know and understand what he is talking about.

They start with, for example, \"I promise I will not take away your mobile phone if you tell me that somebody is bullying you.

It is a pleasure to be here.  I am the policy director for Facebook in Ireland and the UK and my colleague, Ms Patricia Cartes, leads for us on safety throughout the region of Europe, the Middle East and Africa and she will take the members through a presentation around how we handle safety at Facebook.<\/p><p>  I thought it might be useful to give members an introduction to Facebook.  Facebook was created nine years ago with a mission, which remains as it is today, to make the world more open and connected.  In practice, that means we provide a platform and a service via which people can connect with their friends, wherever they are in the world, for free and they can share with them what they are doing, where they are, photographs, passions and political interests.  They can do all kinds of connecting with people they know and, indeed, people they do not know in that they may have a particular interest in certain public figures, bands or artists.  We do this on a massive scale.  <\/p><p>  Facebook now has 1 billion active users, that is, 1 billion accounts.  We do not allow people to have more than one account.  Approximately, 5 billion actions are taken on Facebook every day.  That can be a range of actions from liking something to posting to commenting on a post to posting a link.  Most of that activity is entirely wholesome, innocuous and life-enhancing in many ways but some of it is not wholesome and some of it may be offensive and may actually be harmful.  One of the things Ms Cartes will take members through is what happens in such situations, what tools we provide and how we handle those kinds of issues.  <\/p><p>  I also thought it would be worthwhile giving a sense of how  Facebook happens.  At the heart of Facebook is the Internet.  That is how people use it; it is an Internet-based service and one has to be online in order to use Facebook.  We are a technology company.  That is at the heart of everything we do and we are always looking for innovations in the use of technology to enhance the experience of our users and that includes how we keep people safe, which Ms Cartes will explain shortly.<\/p><p>  We are a company of around 5,000 people.  At the moment, we have 400 in Dublin rising to 500 over the course of this year.  Members may have seen a recent announcement about that.  A good number of those people are involved in helping our users to use the platform effectively and to keep themselves safe.  We also have standards; this is not a free for all.  We have standards about what is and what is not acceptable on Facebook.  <\/p><p>  One thing I recognise - we find this in any audience we talk to about Facebook - is that there are varying levels of understanding about the platform, often based on how much people actually use it themselves.  We have tried to minimise the jargon in this presentation and in what we say but if there are any issues which members think they do not quite understand and if we are using jargon that is not familiar to them, they should ensure they ask us because we want to ensure we illuminate their consideration of these important issues.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700011#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Milner"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362653400,"counter":1478,"content":"<p>I joined Facebook a number of years ago when we set out to open our European headquarters in Dublin.

We have policies, which are the rules of engagement on the site; processes, which are the mechanisms available to the public for them to reach out to us; people supporting the community; and partnerships in place.  We will speak in-depth about these areas as we move along with the presentation.<\/p><p>  I will begin with our policies.  Unlike other platforms, we have a real name policy that we enforce on our site.  We take this very seriously and when one interacts on Facebook, one is doing so as an extension of oneself in the online sphere.  It is important that a person does this with a real name, and we have found that over time people are more likely to be responsible when they engage with their real identity, as they are accountable for their actions.<\/p><p>  We also have zero tolerance of abuse, so there are limits to freedom of speech, as mentioned by Mr. Milner.  We want users to interact freely and speak about matters of public importance but there are boundaries.  A person cannot attack a private individual or target him or her in any way.  We will remove any abusive behaviour directed at private individuals.  We draw the line in the difference between harm and offence, and it is important to make that distinction.  With over 1 billion users, there are many different cultures interacting and many different points of view.  We want to enable conversation and not censor content but we also need to protect users.  We do this by analysing context.<\/p><p>  When somebody reports content to us, it is important that we understand the full picture being brought to our attention.  In order to do this, we rely on community reports.  People report to us through the help centre - there is a screen grab of this in the documentation - and also through the \"report\" buttons placed throughout the site.  We want to empower users to bring examples of abuse to our attention, and we do this by providing very thorough information on our help centre.  That deals with very simple matters such as how to put a photo on Facebook to very complex matters like how to request removal of an image that is violating a person's rights.  People can also click on a \"report\" button and specify what type of abuse is taking place on the platform.  That enables us to remove specific pieces of content rather than full profiles; we can imagine that a person may cross the line one day but most of the time is responsible, and we can take action against the content that has crossed the line, teaching the individual that he or she should not engage in an irresponsible manner.<\/p><p>  We have special privacy protection for our youngest users.  We understand that minors have not had the time we have had to learn how to engage safely in the world and it is our duty to ensure we protect them.  In order to do so we have implemented special privacy protection.  For example, minors cannot be found through public search engines in name searches.  They also have a maximum audience of \"friends of friends\".  This means that when they choose to share something on the platform, the maximum audience of people who will be able to see the content is \"friends of friends\".  Every time we develop a new feature, we have minors in mind, so there will always be special privacy protection built into the product.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700012#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Cartes"},{"type":"speech","time":1362654000,"counter":1485,"content":"<p>Before the witnesses move on with the presentation, we will suspend the meeting so Members can vote and return immediately.

This enables us to provide 24-7 coverage.  The centre that would be most relevant to Members is our Dublin office in which we have representatives from more than 25 countries, supporting 23 languages.  This means that if a person in, say, France, has an issue and writes in French, a French specialist will respond to the queries.  We investigate reports manually when we receive them from the community but we also build smart tools to automate our processes and support our robust community.  If somebody decides to create a fake account, impersonating somebody like Ronan O'Gara who is a well-known public figure in Ireland, our Irish specialists will be able to work with our systems to block those keywords and, therefore, prevent the account creating any imposters.<\/p><p>  We rely on the community to bring abuse to our attention, although we are proactive towards the more sensitive issues such as child protection or tourism.  One thing we realised early on was that in the outlying world when one faces an issue one can talk to people in the community and share the background of the case.  As there was not a similar site on Facebook we decided to create a channel specifically for this purpose.  Now when one faces abuse on Facebook, whether it violates the Facebook standards or not, one is prompted to contact somebody in the community or the person who has uploaded the content and ask them to remove the content or ask for advice from the community.  Therefore, if I am a student and getting bullied in the classroom, I can talk to my teacher through the social reporting mechanism - the teacher may or may not be my friend on Facebook - and will be able to enter their e-mail address within this system and this person will have the background of the case and will be able to provide advice.  We also give the person access to our safety centre which contains much information on how to deal with abuse in order that they can make an informed decision before providing one with advice.  This has enabled people to solve situations face to face and, in turn, has contributed to the education of the community.  We speak many times about bullying.  We see cases where bullying is not taking place but it is simply somebody not understanding the rules of engagement or not behaving responsibly.  I could be a responsible user and upload a photograph of Mr. Simon Milner today that he may not like and he may get offended by that photograph.  He is entitled to bring that to my attention in order that I can remove it or bring it to the attention of those who know us and eventually to Facebook if he wants to find a permanent solution.  <\/p><p>  When people report content to us we find that transparency is a very important element, so we let them know what has happened to their reports through a tool called the support dashboard.  The support dashboard lives within one's account and one is notified when one submits a report of abuse to Facebook and also when we have looked into it.  At all stages we tell one how long it will take for us to review the content and what action we have taken.  Furthermore, we also tell one the policies of the case one has brought to our attention.  Abuse comes in many forms, from spam campaigns to privacy violations to bullying.  When one provides us with a report of a situation that is unpleasant we will look into the specific type of abuse and inform one of our policies with regard to that abuse.  At all stages our policies are public and can be visited online by going to <i>Facebook.com\/communitystandards<\/i>.  We provide users with education throughout the product so that they understand at all stages to what rules we are holding their behaviour accountable.<\/p><p>  Finally, I want to highlight our partnerships.  Safety is taking part in this conversation.  We are responsible as the providers of the platform but it is important that we take into account the feedback provided to us by members of our global safety advice reward which comprise five leading organisations which are experts in different fields from child protection to domestic violence.  These organisations have privileged access to our platform and give us advice before we launch any features.  Based on that feedback we will modify our settings to make sure the community can remain safe.<\/p><p>  We have a number of local partnerships in Ireland.  We work with the safer Internet centre, Webwise and we have an InHope node.  During the previous session the committee mentioned the UK Safer Internet Centre which is funded by the European Commission under the safer Internet programme.  We work on an ongoing basis with all of the safer Internet centres across Europe and, more specifically, in Ireland, with Webwise and ISPAI of which we are a member.  We provide these organisations with a direct communication talk or policy case work through which they can bring to our attention cases they have received in their hotline so that we can review the case, facilitate a solution but also, if necessary, modify our policies and processes when we find gaps in our platform.  We are by no means perfect.  This is an ongoing conversation we have with all stakeholders.<\/p><p>  I wish to draw the attention of the committee to our partner Samaritans, which enables us to provide people who are feeling suicidal, or friends of people who are feeling suicidal, with specialised support.  Therefore, if one notices that somebody within one's environment is feeling sad or is having suicidal thoughts, and if one reports it to Facebook we will contact one and the person at risk and share the Samaritans' contact details in order that one can get further support.  As with any reports submitted to us, they are confidential.  At that stage, the person who has reported you will be shown to you, if you have been reported and the other way around.  It is important to note that our blocking features enable one to prevent interaction with somebody, if one is feeling harassed.  Again, it is important that we empower users to protect themselves, aside from the features that we have designed.  One of those features is the blocking mechanism which prevents interaction both ways, both from the person who has been blocked and the person who is taking the action.  <\/p><p>  This is a very brief presentation on our safety features.  We have tried our best to condense all the material.  I invite the committee to visit our Dublin offices.  The safety team and I would love to host the committee in the office and walk it through some of the procedures in more depth so that it can understand how seriously we take the protection of our users.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700013#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Cartes"},{"type":"speech","time":1362654300,"counter":1489,"content":"<p>On that point, I think we should do that before we finish the report.

Is there any way of grouping those together in order that people know they are dealing with a Deputy or Senator and not somebody who is purporting to be a Deputy or Senator on the day?

It worth saying, before she answers those questions in detail, that the real identity principle goes right across the site.  It is really about people's profiles, that is about users.

It is worth understanding the nature of a page versus a profile.  There is no such thing as an inauthentic page.  There is such thing as an inauthentic profile.  I expect many of the Deputies and Senators have pages and that is a rather different entity.  I will allow Ms Patricia Cartes to respond to those questions and I hope that will help the committee understands how it works on Facebook.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700014#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Milner"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362654900,"counter":1493,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for asking this question.  Real identity is very important to us and I am glad to have the opportunity to explain it.  Facebook is based on one connecting to people who matter to one.  Therefore, when one creates an account with one's real name, one will be approving a friendship request from people one knows.  In a way this helps to regulate the community because people will be reporting, others that they think are impersonating their friends but also if they do not know somebody they can mark that person as unknown to them, at the point at which they receive the friend request.  In a way this is self-regulated.  The community will bring to our attention fake accounts.  We also have a number of mechanisms to detect fake accounts and we have a number of classifiers, automated mechanisms to detect them and these are quite powerful.  Also we will examine factors such as one's date of birth, all of which is automated, changes in date of birth and changes of name.  One cannot modify one's name more than a certain number of times.  One can use nicknames but one will have to use one's real name.  If we see that one is modifying one's name after one reaches the threshold, it is our user operations team who will approve any further changes.  That in turn enables us to locate fake accounts.  All in all, we have proactive and reactive measures to verify the authenticity of accounts.<\/p><p>  On the issue of turnaround times for reports, we strive to prove a 24-hour to 48-hour turnaround time.  However, the turnaround time varies from type of abuse to type of abuse.  We also prioritise issues depending on what is happening in the real world.  If we take the example of the London riots which was put up here yesterday, our platform was not used for the co-ordination of violence because we modify our supports to prioritise any related reports.  In turn, when the community realised that we were providing timely supports and turning around the reports very fast, they started co-ordinating the clean-up operations rather than the violence.  We were looking to what was happening in one country and we were also looking to who reported this.  If one is a minor and reports a piece of content to Facebook we will prioritise that more highly than any other report, which means that minors will find a shorter response time when they submit content to us.  <\/p><p>  How many profiles have we removed?  It is important to note that over time we have modified the way in which we proceed.  One will hear many bullying experts speak about what measures have to be taken, whether it is a punitive measure or a restorative measure.  We believe that trying to bring users into compliance in our platform is a very effective mechanism.  If one is bullying somebody or uploading content that is inappropriate we have the ability to restrict some of one's features.  If one is uploading photographs that violate the Facebook terms, we can remove one's ability to upload photographs for a certain amount of time.  One will be prompted to read our community standards before one can fully engage with the site again.  Of course, if the violation is very severe, we will seek to fully remove the account.  What we found over time is that when people are taught in this way, through what we call these educational checkpoints, they are likely to react well to the education and modify their behaviour to be back into compliance.  <\/p><p>  The number of accounts we remove might not be as informative as one would want them to be.  It is much more interesting to see how many users we bring back into compliance over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700014#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Cartes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362654900,"counter":1494,"content":"<p>In some ways it is an illustration of how we learn from the real world.

Where there is an alignment of interests around a particular campaign, we will provide financial support to those organisations.  We are a member of different organisations, including ISPAI, where we, along with other companies in Ireland, pay our subscription, and that contributes to the work of the hotline.  We have similar relationships with safety organisations across the world, including elsewhere in Europe.  It is something that we do.  It is always about alignment and finding organisations where, by working together, one can have more impact for people in those particular countries.<\/p><p>  I sympathise with Deputy Ann Phelan's concerns about how much of people's lives they put online and how much they share.  Certainly, sometimes one sees things and one thinks, \"Did you really mean to share that?\"  However, I often come across people who are my age who tell me there are two reasons they do not use Facebook.  One is because everything they do will be online and the other is that everybody will be able to see it.  Neither is true.  It is up to you as to what you share.  If you want to share where you are today, if you want to check-in to a particular location, you can choose to do it.  It is up to you as to how much of your information you want to share.  Then one can also control the audience for that.  You can do it, not only on your account generally but on every specific piece of content that you post on Facebook.  You can decide who can see it.  You can even decide just to keep it to yourself and keep it almost as a running diary of what you have been up to over the course of the week, and nobody else can see it but you.<\/p><p>  One of the things that we want to do - this hearing is a fantastic further opportunity to do that - is to let people know that the information is all there on the site.  We provide many resources.  When people sign up, there is a good deal of information that helps them understand that.  As with most matters, and we learn this from experience, one learns by doing.  When I talk to people, I say, \"Have you used this service?  Have you tried it?  Have you used these different features?\"  Once people get the hang of it, they realise it is very easy to control the visibility of what one is doing on Facebook.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700015#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Milner"},{"type":"speech","time":1362655500,"counter":1505,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Milner and Ms Cartes.  The presentations we heard, previously and from Facebook, highlight the differences between the two platforms.  I hope they will excuse me for saying this, but I have heard it a few times and they have probably heard it hundreds of times.  When talking about the difference between Facebook and Twitter, somebody mentioned that Facebook makes strangers out of friends and Twitter makes friends out of complete strangers.  Obviously, it is over generalising, but to take the analogy of going to a kind of town square and meeting people, some of them would be anonymous on Twitter and on Facebook it is more like going into their classroom, into their clubhouse or into where they socialise.  Perhaps I am generalising far too much.  I am interested in the approach Facebook has taken.  For example, anonymity is not an option on Facebook and as a result, one gets different content.<\/p><p>  I am also interested in the partnership approach that Facebook has taken with some of the agencies that do significant work in handling abuse and offence, and dangers.  Does Facebook adopt a partnership approach with the office for Internet safety through the Department of Justice and Equality?  Mr. Milner might be able to flesh that out, if there is a relationship with that office.<\/p><p>  One of the matters brought to my attention was a sublime difficulty with which some deal.  Where someone may post something, it is not that they would attract negative comment but that they are not attracting enough likes, while a friend in the same classroom is putting up something similar and getting ten times the amount of likes, and it is beginning to become an issue.  There is a competitive element.  Facebook is so widely used, particularly among school friends.  It is merely an issue I had not thought of until recently.  That could be an issue as well.  I accept it is very difficult to deal with it.  Mr. Milner is probably aware of it.  It was brought to my attention.<\/p><p>  Facebook is a fantastic resource.  We use it to do what we do, both socially and through the political work.  It is brilliant to reach out to those who we would not normally get a chance to reach.  It is reassuring that Facebook has its controls.<\/p><p>  There was one question I meant to ask.  I would imagine for Facebook to implement its safety policies must require a great deal of staff.  Can Mr. Milner give us some idea of what staff resources Facebook puts towards dealing with reports and with these abuse issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700015#P00300","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362655500,"counter":1506,"content":"<p>I will take the staff resources issue.  I have not come across the issue of likes jealousy before.  That is a new one.  Maybe Ms Cartes has and she can comment on that.  Then we will talk a little about how we have worked with the Irish Government over time.<\/p><p>  On staff resources, Facebook provides a global number for staff, which is approximately 5,000.  We do not provide a public breakdown of how many staff work on different matters.<\/p><p>  The committee might be forgiven for thinking that Ms Cartes is the sole person running safety for Facebook.  She is not.  The committee can rest assured that a substantial number of staff are involved in work in supporting our users.  A good illustration of this is that a couple of weeks ago, when the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, came to our offices when we announced that we were going to be recruiting for 100 new posts this year, there were some 60 posts advertised on our Facebook careers page and, roughly, a quarter to a third of those were in our user operations team.  That gives the committee a sense of the scale of the effort but, as I stated, we do not have a public number that I can give for how many staff are involved in safety at Facebook.<\/p><p>  On the issues of the Government, being up-front, we have not engaged with the office of Internet safety but we have engaged with the anti-bullying group set up by the ministry of education.  Ms Cartes has been involved in that and can explain what we have done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700015#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Milner"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362655500,"counter":1507,"content":"<p>We have engaged with the anti-bullying working group set up by the Ministers, Deputies Quinn and Fitzgerald.<\/p><p>  We do not work directly with the office for Internet safety.  However, both Webwise and <i>hotline.ie<\/i> are parts of the office for Internet safety and we engage with them on a daily basis.  The channel I mentioned previously, policy casework, is open to them to submit reports to us.  While we have not engaged directly with the arm of this organisation, we regularly engage with both the INSAFE and INHOPE notes that work closely with the office for Internet safety.<\/p><p>  On the number of staff, Mr. Milner mentioned earlier that we are a technology company and engineering is at the heart of what we do.  If one comes to Facebook, one will see hack signs everywhere - I refer to ethical hacking.  When we realised that we were not providing users with transparency on reports, rather than looking to hire 3,000 staff to respond to queries we designed a support dashboard which brought our back-end to the front of the users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030700015#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Cartes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362656100,"counter":1509,"content":"<p>How do we compare to other countries?

We have never seen particular patterns of behaviour in Ireland which are abusive or differ from other countries.  Discussion has taken place previously on whether Ireland has more bullying than other countries.  We do not think this is the case.  Just like in other regions and countries there is bullying and abuse, but a very small number of the Facebook population comes across offensive content.

We were part of this coalition, and it enabled us to examine five areas of concern, including age appropriate privacy settings.
