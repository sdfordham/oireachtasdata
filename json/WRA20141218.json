While I can have no role in negotiating the prices received by farmers, I have made every effort to ensure that we have the appropriate policy support environment in place to secure a sustainable future for all in the beef sector.  I brought forward a number of initiatives as part of a &euro;40m investment in the sector in 2014, including the creation of the Beef Genomics Scheme with planned expenditure of &euro;23 million. In the recent budget, I announced a total package of approximately &euro;74 million for the beef sector in 2015, including a provision of &euro;52 million for a proposed Beef Data and Genomics Programme. The budget package included an additional sum of &euro;9 million to fund the Beef Data Programme, &euro;6 million to assist farmer participation in the Beef Quality Assurance Scheme, and a further &euro;1 million for Bord Bia in support of its marketing of Irish products abroad.<\/p><p>  As the deputy is aware, I also established a Beef Roundtable forum earlier this year to facilitate discussions on the strategic issues facing the sector and to exchange intelligence on market developments and forecast. The Roundtable has proven to be a valuable resource for improved engagement and communication between stakeholders within the sector. There have been four meetings of the Roundtable to date and I intend to also call a meeting in January to build on recent progress and continue the engagement. The Roundtables have been an excellent opportunity to hear from others such as retailers so that all links in the supply chain better understand the market for Irish beef in Europe.<\/p><p>  The most recent discussions last month led to a number of notable outcomes, including the decision to press forward with the development of Producer Organisations to rebalance bargaining power along the supply chain. <\/p><p>  Processors also agreed to farmer requests for a moratorium on weight penalties in 2015, no dual base pricing for steers and heifers in individual processing plants, and the introduction of a cost neutral price incentive for all steers and heifers from Quality Assured farms with effect from 1st January. These are just a few of the 23 Outcomes agreed at the meeting of the 12th  November. <\/p><p>  There should now be no delay in implementing these outcomes. My Department and the relevant State Agencies are working to deliver on various elements of the agreement. It is important that the processors and farm organisations also deliver on their commitments so as to provide a period of stability so that we can move on to tackle the strategic issues facing the sector.<\/p><p>  Finally, I should note that beef prices have been increasing in Ireland in recent weeks and months, and have risen by over 7% since the beginning of September. In addition the gap between beef prices here and those in Britain have narrowed by 20 cents a kilo since mid-September. We have also seen very strong trade in live cattle to Northern Ireland in recent weeks. This rising trend is certainly to be welcomed and, together with the reduced input costs in 2014 as identified in recent analysis from Teagasc, should help to improve margins for suckler farmers heading into 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800068#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Scheme Eligibility","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800068#WRA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[48275\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800068#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he has reviewed the 12 point plan provided to him by the hill farmers group to provide a workable approach for farmers to be able to access the GLAS scheme; his views on adopting the options put forward; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>Following my recent meeting with hill-farmer representatives, I have examined very carefully the 12 point <i>&lsquo;Proposed Implementation Strategy for Commonages in Ireland&rsquo;<\/i>, on which much of our discussion centred.<br\/><br\/>The proposed measures in the new RDP, including GLAS, have been framed in light of the experience of the previous Rural Development programming period and are based on an objective analysis of sectoral needs and priorities and an extensive stakeholder consultation process.<br\/><br\/>The issues raised in the <i>Proposed Implementation Strategy for Commonages in Ireland&rsquo;<\/i>have been thoroughly examined as part of the ongoing process of RDP design and implementation &ndash; for example, the issues relating to stocking levels, appointment of advisors for Commonage Management Plans, and the 50% participation rate have been central to the development of GLAS.

It is neither appropriate nor possible for me or any other Minister for Agriculture in the EU to intervene directly on these issues. Indeed, the new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has emphasised this point again recently in correspondence with members of the Beef RoundTable . Rather than directly influencing prices, m y role as Minister for Agriculture is to create a policy support environment that will allow the beef sector to flourish in line with normal market principles.<\/p><p>  In this regard, I have brought forward a number of initiatives to help the sector, including the creation of the Beef Genomics Scheme with a budget of &euro;23 million in 2014 , payments for which issued to farmers last week.

Total annual production currently stands at 5.4 billion litres approx, with Food Harvest 2020 targeting a 50% increase in the volume of milk produced by 2020.  These statistics speak for themselves regarding the sector's socio-economic importance.<\/p><p>  Dairy Prices are a function of global market dynamics, with supply and demand issues in markets across the globe affecting prices across different dairy commodity groups in domestic markets.  Price volatility is a continuing feature of dairy commodity markets, and it is clear that managing the price peaks and troughs in a way that allows farmers and others to plan ahead is a significant challenge for the sector.  This issue was very much in focus at the recently held National Dairy Conference which I hosted in November.   <\/p><p>  The consensus emanating from the Conference based on numerous analyses is that the long-term fundamentals of global dairy market are strong and intact and that the Irish dairy sector is well placed to gain from the opportunities that will arise.  World dairy consumption is projected to rise considerably over the next 10 years and much of this is expected to be driven by developing markets in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.  This rising demand coincides with the ambitious strategy as outlined in Food Harvest 2020 for growing the dairy sector.  In turn the abolition of dairy quotas is expected to be a key driver of the growth envisaged.  In tandem with opportunity comes challenge, and chief amongst those is price volatility. <\/p><p>  Whilst the long-term fundamentals of the global dairy market are strong objective analysis indicates that we are currently facing into a period of downward price movement following a prolonged period of high prices.  Managing the impact of this kind of volatility, particularly on farmer suppliers, remains a key challenge.  Market support me assures will have a role and I have called on the EU Commission to deploy them as appropriate to support the markets processors and the lending sector will also have a role to play through measures such as fixed price contracts and flexible financing arrangements.<\/p><p>  In terms of how the market will evolve in the medium term, Teagasc, in common with a number of other commentators, anticipate that lower milk prices will lead to a slowdown in the expansion of milk production globally through 2015, with global dairy markets set to witness signs of recovery as the year progresses.  In the medium to longer term population growth and increasing affluence in developing countries will continue to drive strong growth in demand for dairy products, and Irish producers will be well placed to take full advantage of this demand.   <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the aforementioned, in preparing their enterprises for the post quota era, I have at all times urged that farmers have regard for the fact that milk quotas would remain in place until April 2015, along with the associated superlevy regime, and I would take this opportunity today to reiterate this call.

However, I have consistently called on the EU Commission to take action to ease the burden of the super levy in the final year of the quota regime.  In this context a number of other member states are opposed to any action on this and have sought to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone.  I am obviously resolutely opposed to supply controls after quota abolition next April on the basis that these quotas have only served to shackle Irish farmers over the last 30 years.  The resultant stalemate means there is insufficient support for any change to the regulations and no agreement has been possible.  I would urge farmers to use the time between now and the ending of milk quotas next March to identify, in conjunction with their dairy adviser, steps to manage both their milk supply and their dairy herds so that they have an efficient herd as they enter the post quota era.

Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying market demands for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for farmers.  Total live exports to the end of November this year stand at nearly 227,000 head, of which 66,000 went to the UK, an increase of nearly 5,500 head or 8.8% up on the comparable period in 2013.  Specifically, over 16,500 animals have been exported to Britain in 2014, which is an increase of nearly 65% on last year.<\/p><p>  In recent years Irish exporters wishing to export livestock to Britain were able to avail of roll-on, roll-off ferry services from Belfast or Larne.  Early in 2014 an application was received from a shipping company for approval of a roll-on, roll-off ferry to carry livestock from Rosslare.  Following an inspection this ferry was approved for carriage of livestock.  The first such consignment to the UK took place in February 2014, and regular consignments of livestock have been carried from Rosslare since then.   <\/p><p>  The potential to grow the live trade to Britain is impacted by the buying specifications operated by the British retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in that market.  The retailers' longstanding policy is to market British and Irish beef separately.  This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country or the other; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country.  In addition, logistical difficulties can arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant.  Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcasses have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor.  These issues are a matter of commercial preference, both of slaughter plants in Britain, and of British retailers.  Decisions by processors and retailers in other member states in relation to purchasing policy are matters of commercial preference.   <\/p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, they are unlikely to reverse their marketing policy in the short term and are currently under pressure to stock more British beef.  Nevertheless Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.\u00a0 In addition, Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.   <\/p><p>  I have also had several meetings with my Northern counterpart, Minister Michelle O'Neill, on this subject.\u00a0 We agreed to make a joint approach to the three British retailers who stock Irish Beef, accepting that these were commercial matters, but also seeking some flexibility given that this beef is produced to the exacting standards required by British consumers.  Following on from this, I convened a meeting with Minister O' Neill and the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium which took place in October.  At this meeting the NIRC made it clear that their beef buyers had a preference for single origin beef, of which they had ample supply, but they would keep the situation under review.\u00a0 I also met separately with Tesco where we had a full discussion on this and other procurement issues.  Tesco were also invited to and attended a meeting of the Beef Roundtable where all stakeholders had the opportunity to engage with them and gain an insight into their view of the beef market in the UK and Ireland today. <\/p><p>  I will continue to pursue opportunities for exports of live cattle at every opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800069#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licence Applications","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800069#WRB01600"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[48279\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800069#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a decision will be made on the application by Bord Iascaigh Mhara for a salmon farming licence in Galway Bay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>An application by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of finfish near Inis Oirr in Galway Bay was received by my Department in 2012.\u00a0 The application and its accompanying Environmental Impact Statement are being considered under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act and the 1933 Foreshore Act.<br\/><br\/>A determination in respect of the application will be made as soon as possible following completion of the necessary assessment process.

My approach to building on the significant achievements of the strategy up until now is to drive the development of the industry at home and increase Ireland`s market share of the world market.  This will ensure that producers and processors can plan for the future, increasing the value of the industry for the benefit of all.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the performance of the sector in 2014, I am pleased to note that, for the period up to week ending 7 December 2014, Irish sheep throughput at DAFM-approved plants was almost the same as for 2013, with a marginal decline of 0.38%.  Prices paid to producers over the same period have increased, with the average factory price running at 3.24% of last year's level. <br\/><br\/>At producer level I continue to put in place incentives to ensure that producers see a viable future in the sector.  Earlier this year I announced the extension of the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) for a further year.  In committing funding of &euro;3m to the programme in 2015 I am acknowledging the success of the scheme in 2013 and 2014 in which 4,000 producers participated. <br\/><br\/>Support for the sheep sector also comes from the Grassland Sheep Scheme for which I have prioritised funding over the last five years. This scheme delivered <b>&euro;83 million<\/b>directly to the incomes of Irish sheep farmers.  As it was not possible to implement the Grassland payment under the new CAP regime I decided that payments received under the 2014 Grassland Sheep Scheme will be incorporated into the calculation of the entitlement value in each year of the new regime for those farmers who participated in that Scheme.  This will have the effect of increasing their entitlement value and ensure that such farmers do not lose through the cessation of the scheme at the end of 2014. <br\/><br\/>Under the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) I have made provision for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under the Knowledge Transfer measure which has a budget of &euro;100m.  The experience in STAP will inform the development of this measure. In addition to profitability, the emphasis will be on the key issues of business skills, environmental sustainability and herd health, with increased interaction between individual farmers and advisors in order to customise information exchange.  The Knowledge Transfer Programme for the sheep sector will be launched in 2016 when the current STAP concludes. <br\/><br\/>The current AEOS Scheme supports sheep farming through its commonage measure.  The proposed new agri-environment scheme, GLAS (Green Low-carbon Agri-environment Scheme) will also support, amongst others, extensive and hill farmers, who have shown themselves to be careful custodians of the countryside in previous agri-environment schemes.  GLAS intends giving priority to those commonage farmers who come together to form an agreed plan to manage these valuable landscapes.  It also includes a menu of environmental actions, many of which will be suitable for all sheep farmers. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On the export front<b><\/b>I intend to drive further the search for new markets.  My Department in consultation with the meat industry and in cooperation with Bord Bia and the Irish Embassies abroad is constantly pushing for new markets and opportunities. <br\/><br\/>Already this year, we have agreed veterinary health certificates with Lebanon, Namibia, Hong Kong and The Philippines thus allowing for the export of Irish sheepmeat to those countries.  Also, during my visit to China leading a Trade Mission in November 2014, I was able to hand over the completed version of a sheep questionnaire which we had been asked to complete in connection with our efforts to gain access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat.  This represents the first milestone on the road which will lead, I hope, to Ireland gaining access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800069#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Data Programme","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800069#WRB02200"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[48282\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800069#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when the genomics scheme will open next year in view of the recent observations on this scheme by the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is proposed as an EU co-funded scheme which forms part of Ireland's draft Rural Development Programme and will involve a budget of some &euro;300m over a 6-year period.

Progress to date has been very positive, as shown in the <i>Milestones 2014<\/i>report published in September.  I recently announced the establishment of a new committee, chaired by John Moloney, with responsibility for developing a strategy up to 2025. Background documents and a consultative questionnaire are available on my Department's website, and I would urge any interested parties to make a submission before the consultation deadline of 9 January.  The strategic development of the agri-food sector, focusing on value added products in growth markets, underpinned by sustainable and efficient farming and food processing, makes a vital contribution to farm viability. <br\/><br\/>The finalisation of CAP reform last year provides a huge degree of certainty to farmers in terms of the policy environment in which they operate.  Direct payments provide a valuable source of farm income support and act as a hedge against the price volatility which is now a fact of life.  The Rural Development Programme under Pillar II of the CAP will contribute directly to sustaining and improving the viability of Irish farms. <br\/><br\/>With regard to off-farm rural development, implementation of the CEDRA report has commenced and is being directed through the CEDRA Interdepartmental Group established and chaired by Minister Phelan. <br\/><br\/>The recent Agri-taxation Review was a joint initiative by myself and the Minister for Finance.  To increase the mobility and productive use of land the Review included a comprehensive package to enhance the attractiveness of long-term leasing of land.  It also included an enhanced provision for income averaging for farmers, which will allow more scope to smooth farm incomes within a commodity price cycle and thus help mitigate income volatility challenges.  I was please d that Minister Noonan adopted all of these recommendations, which were part of the twelve new agri-tax measures included in Budget 2015 arising from the findings of the Agri-taxation Review.<br\/><br\/>Finally, it should be borne in mind that off-farm sources of income provide a vital support to farm households.

In 2015, the Government will agree a roadmap and timeline for the introduction of a new, universal supplementary pension saving scheme.<br\/><br\/>- Supporting Local Authorities in the roll out of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) to 8,000 recipients in 2015.<br\/><br\/>- Continue to rollout of the Public Services Card.<br\/><br\/>In addition, on Budget Day, I announced a number of measures for implementation in 2015.  One of the key objectives of Budget 2015 was to assist unemployed families to return to work.<br\/><br\/>Through the Back to Work Family Dividend scheme announced in Budget 2015, long-term unemployed jobseekers with children who leave welfare and return to work can retain the child-related portion of their social welfare payment on a tapered basis over two years.  This includes those who move to self-employment, such as the construction sector.  It will also apply to One-Parent Family Payment recipients who similarly go back to work.  The scheme will be worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year of employment or self-employment and half that amount again in the second year.<br\/><br\/>The expansion of JobsPlus, the employer incentive scheme, which provides cash grants to businesses that hire persons who have been long-term unemployed, will provide for an additional 3,000 employees to be supported by this scheme.<br\/><br\/>Child Benefit will increase from &euro;130 to &euro;135 per month with effect from January, which will benefit over 611,000 households with children.  This will help all families with children but also has the additional benefit for unemployed families in that it is work neutral as it is retained in full when they return to the workforce.<br\/><br\/>A range of other measures were also announced. These included an additional &euro;2 million funding for the School Meals scheme, primarily for the provision of breakfast clubs to support school going children in disadvantaged areas, and where possible, to increase funding for existing DEIS schools as a consequence of increased pupil numbers.<br\/><br\/>In January, there will be an increase of &euro;1.30 in the Living Alone Allowance from &euro;7.70 a week to &euro;9 a week as a targeted support for pensioners and people with disabilities living alone.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the current Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2014 provides for the retention of the weekly earnings disregard for recipients of One-Parent Family Payment in 2015 and subsequent years at its current level of &euro;90.<br\/><br\/>In line with the Government decision of 19 November last, the Department will also administer the new water conservation grant on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  This grant will replace the water support measures announced in the Budget.<br\/><br\/>Finally, I was also pleased to be able to reintroduce a partial Christmas Bonus this year and this has now been paid to approximately 1.2 million people.<br\/><br\/>Looking ahead, I will ensure that the social welfare system is reformed and improved so as to provide sustainable and adequate income supports and services in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800070#WRC00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":99,"content":"<p>Question No. 44 answered with Question No. 37.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":100,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 45 and 46 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800070#WRC01050"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[49104\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800070#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a social welfare appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath regarding a claim for carer's allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that following an oral hearing of this case on 10 June 2014 it was agreed to review the case by way of further investigation by a Social Welfare Inspector.<\/p><p>  Following these investigations, the file in question was returned to the Appeals Office on 2 October 2014.

In 2012 the average processing time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision, and also in 2014.  As at 30 November 2014, the average time taken to process an appeal requiring an oral hearing was 28.7 weeks and for a summary decision was 21.4 weeks.<br\/><br\/>Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system. By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<br\/><br\/>There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the improvement in processing times, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the annual number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 9,793 at 15 December 2014.<br\/><br\/>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<br\/><br\/><b>Appeals processing times by scheme 01\/01\/2014 &ndash; 30\/11\/14<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Summary Decisions<\/th><th>Average processing <br \/><br \/>times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Oral Hearings<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit<\/td><td>17.1<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blind Pension<\/td><td>20.2<\/td><td>25.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance<\/td><td>30.6<\/td><td>34.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit<\/td><td>23.1<\/td><td>23.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Child Benefit<\/td><td>23.6<\/td><td>33.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance<\/td><td>20.9<\/td><td>27.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit<\/td><td>29.7<\/td><td>34.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance<\/td><td>23.0<\/td><td>29.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Benefit<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>64.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Allowance<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>41.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Farm Assist<\/td><td>23.6<\/td><td>28.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant<\/td><td>25.6<\/td><td>31.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement<\/td><td>26.5<\/td><td>32.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension<\/td><td>26.2<\/td><td>31.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives<\/td><td>21.5<\/td><td>33.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment<\/td><td>24.1<\/td><td>33.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit<\/td><td>23.1<\/td><td>44.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit<\/td><td>48.5<\/td><td>47.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td><td>26.7<\/td><td>43.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Cont)<\/td><td>20.2<\/td><td>29.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)<\/td><td>27.0<\/td><td>35.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit<\/td><td>31.4<\/td><td>33.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension<\/td><td>23.8<\/td><td>31.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit (Medical)<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>53.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement<\/td><td>21.5<\/td><td>53.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)<\/td><td>25.9<\/td><td>24.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-con)<\/td><td>17.9<\/td><td>30.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pre Retirement Allowance<\/td><td>17.3<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)<\/td><td>18.4<\/td><td>27.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance<\/td><td>16.3<\/td><td>21.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JA\/JB Fraud Control<\/td><td>12.1<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit<\/td><td>16.9<\/td><td>21.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Treatment Benefit<\/td><td>20.8<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Respite Care Grant<\/td><td>25.8<\/td><td>27.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Insurability of Employment<\/td><td>44.6<\/td><td>66.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance<\/td><td>14.6<\/td><td>22.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Con)<\/td><td>19.9<\/td><td>31.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-Con)<\/td><td>24.8<\/td><td>23.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widowed Parent Grant<\/td><td>24.4<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>All Appeals<\/td><td>21.4<\/td><td>28.7<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800070#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Data","counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800070#WRC03750"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[49368\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800070#WRC03800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the current number of young persons not in education, training or employment; the current percentage of youth unemployment; the way this number compares to the EU area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":142,"content":"<p>Based on micro data from the Quarterly National Household survey, the Department of Social protection estimates that the number of young people aged less than 25 years not in employment, education or training in the second quarter of 2014 was 76,500.

I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and is acting as a disincentive for work and investment in Ireland.

Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is charged at 41%, with limited exemptions, on interest earned on deposit accounts.\u00a0 Local Property Tax (LPT) introduced in 2013 is a tax based on the market value of residential properties. Finance Act 2010 introduced a new levy known as the Domicile Levy which can be seen as a form of wealth tax. It is aimed at high wealth individuals with a substantial connection to Ireland, whether they are tax resident or not, to ensure they make a tax contribution to this country in a year of at least &euro;200,000.  <br\/><br\/>The Government has no plans to introduce a wealth tax, although all taxes and potential taxation options are of course constantly reviewed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800071#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Income Data","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800071#WRD03050"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[48914\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800071#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update on the publishing of data on income distribution from tax data (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners have proactively reviewed both the content and dissemination methods for their publication of statistical information.

Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only.<br\/><br\/>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013.

The lack of competition in the banking sector means that the removal of section 149 would give unfettered price setting power to the incumbent banks.\u00a0 This issue should be revisited when competition in the banking sector has improved significantly.<br\/><br\/>I would advise consumers\u00a0who wish to compare current account offerings\u00a0to look at \u00a0the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission\u00a0website at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800071#WRD04400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IMF Loan Issues","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800071#WRD04450"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[49015\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800071#WRD04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the way the early repayment of IMF loans will affect the relationship between Ireland and the IMF as regards the monitoring of the State by the IMF.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>The early repayment of up to &euro;18.3 billion of our loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is being structured to ensure that IMF post programme monitoring continues for the initially envisaged period, i.e. up to mid-2021.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  It is normal for a member country to engage in post-program monitoring with the IMF after its programme has ended as long as its outstanding loan exceeds 200\u00a0percent of its IMF quota, and when it no longer has program involvement of any kind with the IMF.<\/p><p>  Under post-programme monitoring, countries undertake more frequent formal consultations with the IMF than in the case under the IMF's normal surveillance, with a particular focus on macroeconomic and structural policies that have implications for external viability.

Where the limit is exceeded, a significant tax charge is imposed on the excess when the benefits are drawn down. In this way, the SFT acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place, or unwinds the tax advantage of such overfunding, by clawing back, through the significant tax charge, the tax relief granted.<br\/><br\/>The SFT legislation provides that where an individual has pension rights in excess of the SFT limit (at the relevant dates) he or she could claim a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) from Revenue in order to protect or &quot;grandfather&quot; the value of those rights on that date. <br\/><br\/>The attached schedule sets out in summary form the principal changes made to the SFT regime since its inception. For convenience, the changes are set out on a Finance Act basis. <br\/><br\/>The SFT regime and the various changes to the regime outlined in the Schedule apply, generally, to all private and public sector pension schemes and pension arrangements, with the exception of the encashment option and the specific public sector related reimbursement options. <br\/><br\/>As regards the encashment option, I introduced this measure to deal with particular difficulties that individuals with both private and public service pension arrangements would otherwise face from the operation of the SFT regime. An individual in the private sector is generally able to prevent or minimise any breaching of the SFT, or a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT), if he or she has one, by ceasing to contribute to, or accrue benefits under a pension scheme. However, affected individuals in the public service have no such control over their accrual of public service pension entitlements and, as a result, significant chargeable excesses could arise on the public service pension entitlement at retirement in certain circumstances. This is the case where such individuals have built up substantial private sector pension savings before taking up a public service career. Concerns were expressed that this could have a significant disincentive effect for some people to remain in the public service or hinder the future recruitment into the public service of exceptionally well-qualified people from the private sector.<br\/><br\/>As regards the reimbursement options, as mentioned above public servants cannot prevent a chargeable excess arising and the significant tax charge that ensues, as they have no means of ceasing to accrue benefits under their schemes. It was for that reason that I introduced in Finance Act 2012 a more flexible reimbursement option for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax and extended it in Finance (No.2) Act 2013. I should stress that these reimbursement options do not remove or reduce the tax liability arising on a chargeable excess but provide more flexible options for the recovery of the tax liability by the pension scheme administrator. These options involve effectively spreading the recovery of the tax, paid up front by the public service pension administrator, over a longer period. <br\/><br\/>As regards the number of individuals that may be affected by the changes to the Standard SFT regime introduced from 1 January 2014, it is difficult to be definitive about this issue. Among other reasons, this is because the changes are likely to have both direct impacts and indirect behavioural impacts. The direct impacts will be on individuals whose pension savings or entitlements were in excess of the reduced SFT on 1 January 2014 and who have to apply for a PFT certificate. There will also be direct effects on those individuals whose pension savings or entitlements were below the threshold on 1 January 2014 but, with future contributions or accruals, may exceed the threshold in time. For both of these groups where the SFT or PFT is exceeded at the point of retirement, chargeable excess tax will arise. However, the changes are also likely to mean that individuals (generally in the private sector) who may otherwise be affected by the amendments to the SFT, and who have the flexibility to do so, may change behaviour and opt out of additional pension saving or pension accrual, in circumstances where they can obtain compensatory payments from their employer, in order to avoid breaching the SFT or their PFT. Overall, it is estimated that the changes could potentially impact, both directly and indirectly, on up to 10,000 individuals in the short to medium term.<br\/><br\/><b>Schedule<\/b><br\/><br\/><b>Principal changes to the Standard Fund Threshold since inception<\/b><br\/><br\/><b>Finance Act 2011<\/b><br\/><br\/>- The original SFT limit of &euro;5 million, which through indexation had increased to c. &euro;5.4m, was reduced to &euro;2.3m with effect from 7 December 2010.<br\/><br\/>- Individuals with pension rights in excess of the new lower SFT on 7 December 2010 could claim a PFT (not exceeding the old SFT of &euro;5.4m) from Revenue in order to protect or &quot;grandfather&quot; the value of those rights on that date.\u00a0<br\/><br\/><b>Finance Act 2012<\/b><br\/><br\/>- An &quot;encashment&quot; option was introduced with effect from 8 February 2012, to address particular difficulties arising from the reduction in the SFT limit to &euro;2.3m in Finance Act 2011, for individuals with dual private sector and public sector pension arrangements. The encashment option provides a one-off opportunity for individuals who meet the conditions to encash their private pension rights, in whole or in part, from age 60 with a view to preventing or minimising the chargeable excess that would otherwise arise when the public sector pension crystallises. The exercise of the option attracts tax at the point of encashment at the higher income tax rate on a ring-fenced basis plus USC. No tax-free lump sum is available in respect of the pension rights encashed.<br\/><br\/>- Provision was made to address an unintended &quot;double taxation&quot; anomaly whereby tax at the standard rate arises on a retirement lump sum (in excess of the tax-free limit of &euro;200,000) paid to an individual under a pension arrangement at the same time as tax arises on a chargeable excess in relation to that individual (the amount of which will have been influenced by the lump sum). With effect from 8 February 2012 a pension scheme administrator is required to offset the tax on the lump sum against the chargeable excess tax.<br\/><br\/>- A more structured and flexible regime was introduced for the reimbursement of public sector pension scheme administrators for chargeable excess tax paid &quot;up-front&quot; by the administrator as\u00a0 follows:<br\/><br\/>- the amount of reimbursement from the lump sum is limited to a maximum of 50% of the value of the lump sum, or a higher percentage if agreed between the individual and the administrator.<br\/><br\/>- the balance, if any, of the amount to be reimbursed is to be recovered from the gross annual pension payable to the individual over a period to be agreed between the individual and the administrator up to a maximum of 10 years, or<br\/><br\/>- by the discharge of the outstanding balance by way of a payment by the individual to the administrator (e.g. from own resources or by way of a distribution from an ARF beneficially owned by the individual), or<br\/><br\/>- by a combination of a reduction in pension and payment of a sum by the individual.<br\/><br\/><b>Finance (No.2) Act 2013<\/b><br\/><br\/>- The value of the SFT was reduced, with effect from 1 January 2014, from &euro;2.3m to &euro;2m,<br\/><br\/>- Individuals with pension rights in excess of the new lower SFT on 1 January 2014 can claim a PFT (not exceeding the old SFT of &euro;2.3m) from Revenue in order to protect or &quot;grandfather&quot; the value of those rights on that date.<br\/><br\/>- The valuation factor to be used for establishing the capital value of defined benefit pension rights at the point of retirement, where this takes place after 1 January 2014, was changed from the standard valuation factor of 20 applying up to that date, to a range of higher age related valuation factors that vary with the individual's age at the point at which the pension rights are drawn down (ranging from a factor of 37 where the individual is aged 50 or under to a factor of 22 where the individual is aged 70 or over).<br\/><br\/>- In calculating the capital value of a defined benefit pension at the point of retirement, transitional arrangements were introduced to provide for a &quot;split&quot; calculation where part of the pension had already been accrued at 1 January 2014 so that the part accrued up to that date will be valued at a factor of 20 and the part accrued after that date valued at the appropriate higher age-related valuation factor,<br\/><br\/>- The reimbursement options, introduced in Finance Act 2012, for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax were amended and extended to reduce the amount that can be recovered upfront from the net retirement lump sum payable to the individual to a maximum of 20% of the net lump sum (down from 50%) and to provide the option of reimbursement of the pension fund administrator by way of a reduction in the gross pension payable over a period not exceeding 20 years.<br\/><br\/><b>Finance Bill 2014<\/b><br\/><br\/>- Amendments made to the SFT legislation to deal with issues arising in relation to pension fund cases involving Pension Adjustment Orders (PAOs by providing that, where chargeable excess tax arises in relation to pension scheme or pension plan benefits that are subject to a PAO, the tax will be apportioned by the scheme administrator, having regard to the terms of the PAO, so that both the member and non-member spouse\/partner share the tax charge equitably.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800073#WRF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Mortgage Loan Book","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800073#WRF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[49289\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800073#WRF03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of the remaining Irish Bank Resolution Corporation in special liquidation residential mortgages in arrears of less than 90 days, of 90 days to 180 days, of 180 days to 360 days, or 360 days to 720 days and of greater than 720 days; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Special Liquidators of IBRC that the remaining unsold residential mortgages are currently going through a sales process called Project Pearl\u00a0which, as is the case for all the\u00a0sales processes, aims to\u00a0maximise the return to all remaining creditors of IBRC, including the State.

The Act sets out the procedures and notice periods that must be complied with when terminating a tenancy. The Private Residential Tenancies Board is responsible for the resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords (per section 151(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004). In circumstances where a receiver is appointed it is essential that the rights of tenants are protected. While the circumstances of each case may vary depending on the terms of the mortgage or charge under which a receiver is appointed, the policies and procedures of banks in appointing receivers cannot affect the statutory or contractual rights of tenants. The tenant continues to enjoy the same security of tenure.\u00a0 The appointment of a receiver does not mean that a tenant loses their rights under the Residential Tenancies Act. The collection of rent is not an activity regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland and accordingly, the provisions of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 and other codes issued by the Central Bank would not apply to a receiver carrying out this activity.<br\/><br\/>Arising out of concerns on this issue the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government met with the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) in relation to the provision of guidance relating to receivers and their responsibilities towards tenants. As a result of that meeting, the IBF published a guide to receivership for residential tenants, which may be viewed at . The guide explains that where a receiver is appointed to a rented residential property, the rent should be paid directly to the receiver and that a receipt should be given by the receiver to the tenant. The guide also advises tenants to contact the receiver in the first instance regarding requests for repairs to the property. This guide is a useful contribution to a clearer understanding of the relationship between receivers and residential tenants.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>However, the interplay between receivership law and the Residential Tenancies Act is complex. In that regard, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is introducing further amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act that will help to bring greater clarity in this area and will be of benefit to tenants and receivers alike.\u00a0 This will provide that where a person is appointed as a receiver to carry out the functions and exercise the powers of a landlord under a tenancy, that person will be considered to be the landlord for the purposes of the 2004 Act.\u00a0 The fundamental objective of any amendments made must be that tenants' rights are protected and that clear and correct information is available to any tenant affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800074#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800074#WRG01650"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[49317\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800074#WRG01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of money presently owing by businesses to the Revenue Commissioners under each tax heading; the age profile of the arrears; and the steps being taken by the Revenue Commissioners to engage with businesses currently struggling to meet their tax liabilities.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":382,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that it reports on the tax debt as at 31 March each year.<br\/><br\/>On 31 March 2014 the total outstanding debt amounted to &euro;1.840 billion.

As the Deputy will be aware, my officials, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners,\u00a0conducted a review of SARP in advance of this year's Budget.  The review analysed aspects of the scheme such as the background and rationale for the programme and data available from the Revenue Commissioners including the cost and take-up of the programme.  In addition, a public consultation and stakeholder meetings were held.  A report was written on the review and this has been published on the Department's website.  Having considered the outcome of the review and Ireland's need to attract FDI, in the recent Budget I decided to:<\/p><p>- extend and enhance SARP for a further three years until the end of 2017;<\/p><p>- Remove the upper salary threshold to encourage senior decision makers to come to Ireland;<\/p><p>- Amend the residency requirement to only require Irish tax residency.  This was proving to be a barrier to individuals in their year of arrival into Ireland, and also for individuals from countries where they are deemed to be permanently tax resident; and<\/p><p>- Reduce the requirement to have been employed abroad by the same employer for 12 months prior to being assigned to Ireland to 6 months in order to align with recent changes to employment permit legislation.<\/p><p>- I believe these measures are a positive step forward as part of a range of measures, forming the Roadmap to secure Ireland's place as a destination for the best and most successful companies in the world.<\/p><p>  The scheme now operates as follows:<\/p><p> - An exemption from income tax on 30% of salary in excess of &euro;75,000 is provided for employees that are assigned for a minimum of 1 year.  The exemption is available for a maximum of 5 years.  The scheme will operate through the PAYE system as a deduction from income tax, but USC will continue to be payable on the full income amount.  Social Insurance will also be payable where the individual is not liable to it in their home country.<\/p><p>- The assignee must have been employed by the company in a country with which Ireland has a Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) or a Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) immediately prior to the assignment to Ireland, and must be tax resident in Ireland in the relevant tax year in order to qualify for SARP.<\/p><p>- One trip home per year is allowed tax free, where paid for by the employer.  No other day-to-day expenses will be permitted free of income tax.  In recognition of differences in curriculums taught and languages spoken by the assignee and\/or their children being brought to Ireland, vouched school fees of up to &euro;5,000 per annum per child where paid for by the employer on behalf of an employee are allowed free of benefit-in-kind taxation.<\/p><p>- Share-based remuneration can also qualify for the exemption and there are no restrictions on where the income can be remitted.<\/p><p>- Any assignee that avails of the scheme up until 31 December 2017 will have access to the relief for the period of their assignment, up to the maximum 5 years.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that this Government is committed to job creation.  A key part of this focus is to attract FDI into Ireland.  It is important that Ireland can attract and retain the decision makers and senior executives who make such investment decisions.  I believe that this measure\u00a0will support the export led recovery in the economy by maintaining Ireland's competitiveness for attracting FDI.  The Deputy will be aware of the\u00a0job creation that results from such investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800074#WRG02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800074#WRG02750"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[49414\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800074#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the procedure to be followed to wind up a business as a sole trader in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":398,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the person concerned must prepare, or have prepared on his behalf, accounts in respect of his business for the period covering from the final date of his last set of accounts prepared to date of cessation of his business.<br\/><br\/>He should also submit a return of income (or returns of income if the final accounts are for a period greater than 12 months), for the appropriate tax year(s). <br\/><br\/>In addition the person concerned should complete and return to the Revenue Commissioners a form TRCN 1 to enable the Revenue Commissioners to cancel his registration for Income Tax.

Any flooding resulting from inadequate storm water drainage capacity in Howth and Sutton is a matter for the local authority and not the Office of Public Works (OPW).<\/p><p>  In October 2013, on foot of an approach from FCC, the OPW agreed to fund the engagement of consultants by FCC to develop proposals for flood defence measures which were recommended in outline form in the report of the Fingal-East Meath Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study. These measures include works on Strand Road to address flooding affecting a number of areas including Sutton.  The consultants are to further progress the proposals, including undertaking a full assessment of their economic viability. It is a matter for the Council to progress the matter and it is understood that work in this regard is ongoing in the Council. <\/p><p>  The OPW has provided funding to FCC  to repair coastal storm damage which occurred in early 2014.

The QNHS covers all sectors of the economy on a quarterly basis and thereby provides us with timely indications of labour market and job creation developments. It provides data by region, economic sector and broad occupation groups, in addition to data by gender and different age cohorts. The data collected through the QNHS for Ireland is comparable with that for other countries and it is also provides the official measure of employment and unemployment in the State on accepted International Labour Organisation (ILO) basis. As a large-scale, nationwide survey of households in Ireland, which began in September 1997, the QNHS allows us to assess labour market developments on a consistent basis for policy research and analysis purposes.Since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched in February 2012 approximately 80,000 additional people are in work net of a reduction in the same period of 20,000 in the public sector.<br\/><br\/>In relation to monitoring employment trends in enterprise development agency-assisted firms, the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI) Annual Employment Survey provides a more granular level of data on employment. On the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s in August 2014, DJEI took over responsibility to carry out the Annual Employment Survey of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland assisted enterprises. Results from the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta annual employment survey are also integrated into the final report published. The Survey is an annual census of employment in all agency-assisted companies that are active within manufacturing, internationally traded and financial services; there are currently approximately 8,500 live client companies surveyed. The survey takes place in October and November of each year. Companies are asked for their Permanent\/ Full-time Jobs and Temporary\/ Part-Time Jobs as at 31 October of that year.<br\/><br\/>DJEI aims to achieve as close to a census of all agency-assisted companies as is practicable during the Annual Employment Survey. Response rates of at least 80% are generally obtained, which is exceptionally high for a voluntary survey that is not mandated by a Statutory Instrument.<br\/><br\/>The survey has been carried out each year since 1972, providing a time-series of longitudinal data with over 30,000 client companies&rsquo; employment histories on file, many of which have been recently geocoded. <br\/><br\/>This survey provides accurate figures of full-time and part-time employment and is used for the purposes of research and analysis, both at the firm level and at regional, sectoral and agency levels. More specifically, employment data can be analysed by, <i>inter alia<\/i>, industrial (NACE) sector, region, county, responsible (i.e. parent) agency, ownership (Irish or foreign) and nationality.<br\/><br\/>The overall growth or decline in employment among agency assisted enterprises is reported on the basis of the net change in employment in a given year. The net change in employment is calculated as the difference between the gross job gains and the gross job losses, whereby gross job gains is the increase in employment in the survey year over and above the employment level in the previous year and gross job losses is the decrease in employment in the survey over and above the employment level in the previous year. First-Time Jobs are calculated as the jobs created in an enterprise over its peak employment level achieved in the previous five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800075#WRH03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800075#WRH03550"},{"type":"question","counter":474,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[48980\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800075#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the special initiatives that will be undertaken by his Department or the State's industrial promotion agencies, to assist in the provision of much-needed employment throughout County Cavan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":475,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[48981\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800075#WRH03700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the special initiatives that will be undertaken by his Department or the State's industrial promotion agencies to assist in the provision of much-needed employment throughout County Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":476,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 178 together.<br\/><br\/>My Department and its agencies are working together to address the unemployment problem that is currently experienced in counties Cavan and Monaghan by implementing the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs which aims to create 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016.<br\/><br\/>Monaghan and Cavan are part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s North East Region along with county Louth.

During a visit to Washington D.C. on 8 December 2014, EU Trade Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m met with US Trade Representative Froman to discuss a fresh start to the negotiations on a EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).  They reviewed the state of play in all areas of the talks and agreed a number of practical steps to prepare the next round of talks which are scheduled to take place in Brussels during the week of 2 February 2015.  These include meetings in January to prepare the February round.The following summarises each round:<br\/><br\/><b>First Round<\/b><br\/><br\/>The negotiations began formally in July, with the 1st round held in Washington in the week beginning 8 July 2013.  The EU's initial position papers on a number of aspects of the negotiations were presented to the US negotiators during the first negotiating round and covered the following areas: Cross-cutting &amp;amp; institutional provisions on regulatory issues; Technical barriers to trade; Sanitary and phytosanitary measures (i.e. barriers to trade in food and agricultural products); Public procurement; Raw materials and energy; and Trade and sustainable development.<br\/><br\/>The feedback from the EU Commission following the first round was positive.  The focus of the first round was on general scoping and exchange of information:  market access issues for goods, services, investment, public procurement and rules of origin; regulatory issues of transparency and regulatory coherence, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary standards and sectoral regulatory issues; and others areas of regulation including intellectual property rights, energy, competition, customs and trade facilitation and sustainable development.<br\/><br\/><b>Second Round<\/b><br\/><br\/>The 2nd round, originally scheduled for the first week in October, but deferred at the request of the US because of the partial government shutdown, took place in Brussels during the week beginning 11 November, 2013.  The EU presented further areas for negotiation to the US side including: Maritime; Air transport; Raw Materials; Energy; Rules of Origin; Market access for goods; Sectoral Regulation; regulatory cooperation in financial services; and cross cutting regulatory and institutional provisions.<br\/><br\/>The feedback from the 2nd round was again positive.  Both sides reiterated that the TTIP was an opportunity to promote even further the trade flows between the two trading blocs and thus promote economic growth. There was also confirmation that regulatory aspects are one of the main elements of the TTIP negotiations, and that two basic principles govern the philosophy of the negotiations: nothing should prevent or undermine the rights of both sides to regulate, and the level of protection (environment, food or consumer safety etc.) will not be lessened.<br\/><br\/><b>Third Round<\/b><br\/><br\/>This round took place in Washington DC during the week commencing 16 December 2013. Both sides discussed all the topics they wanted to see covered in what is intended to be a comprehensive trade agreement. They brought together teams with expertise in a wide range of trade-related areas, as well as regulators from both sides. The EU and US teams also spent time talking to over 50 stakeholders and answering questions from them. This followed efforts by the EU to negotiate as openly as possible and reach out to the widest possible range of interests.  Negotiators made progress on the three core parts of the TTIP &ndash; market access, regulatory aspects and rules, which were to be the focus for the round of talks expected in March 2014.<br\/><br\/><b>Stocktaking Summary<\/b><br\/><br\/>The end of the 3rd round marked the conclusion of the initial phase of negotiations and paved the way for EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht and US Trade Representative Ambassador Michael Froman to hold a high level political stocktaking meeting that took place on 17 -18 February 2014. This provided a political overview of progress to date &ndash; addressing issues that are difficult such as the approach to regulatory convergence, development, and mutual recognition. The two day stocktake helped set the forward agenda that included the 4th round and importantly, trade aspects at the EU-US summit in Brussels in late March. Both sides agreed that after three rounds of talks the negotiations needed to step up a gear and gave guidance to negotiators on the way ahead.<br\/><br\/><b>Fourth Round<\/b><br\/><br\/>The 4th round took place in Brussels from 10 &ndash;14 March 2014, and all negotiating topics, except tariffs, were on the table. Services, Investment, Regulatory Coherence, Energy and Raw Materials, State-Owned Enterprises, Competition and Subsidies, Customs and Trade Facilitation, Dispute Settlement (state-to-state), IPR, Sustainable Development, Government Procurement, Market Access, SPS, TBT and Sectors were covered.  The Commission used the opportunity of the EU-US Summit on 26 March 2014 to get a clear and unambiguous commitment from both sides as regards the level of ambition in this agreement in all areas.  In principle, the Commission and the US agreed to have a similar stocktaking exercise just after the summer.<br\/><br\/><b>Fifth Round<\/b><br\/><br\/>The 5th round of the TTIP negotiations took place from 19 &ndash; 23 May 2014 in Arlington, Virginia.  The overall assessment from the Commission on progress achieved during the 5th round was positive, and suggested that both sides were now commencing the detailed work phase.<br\/><br\/>Close to 25 different negotiating areas were covered in this round.  In the regulatory cluster, reasonable progress was made in technical preparatory work in sectors and improvement in the dynamics of the regulatory coherence discussion.  There was agreement to prepare SPS text for the next round in mid-July.  On market access, there was no discussion on tariffs except for some clarification on the first tariff offers.  Procurement discussions confirmed a wide difference of position about coverage of an initial offer on central level procurement.  On rules, there was discussion on sustainable development.  <br\/><br\/>As in the previous round, a lot of time was dedicated to stakeholder consultation, and over 300 stakeholders representing different interest groups participated in these sessions. The Stakeholders who represent a broad cross section of interest groups had the opportunity to present their concerns and give feedback directly to the TTIP negotiators.<br\/><br\/><b>Sixth Round<\/b><br\/><br\/>The 6th round of the TTIP negotiations took place in Brussels from 14<sup><\/sup>&ndash; 18 July 2014 where all pillars and chapters of the TTIP were discussed.  Close to 25 different negotiating areas were covered in this round with the exception of ISDS and investment protection, tariffs and financial services.  The Commission reported that while there were no breakthroughs, progress was achieved on the essential technical work.  It was reported that the dynamic in the negotiations was clearly influenced by the US mid-term elections in November.<br\/><br\/>On tariffs both sides had already had necessary clarificatory discussions in previous rounds and at that stage no further discussions were considered necessary at a technical level.  The respective services\/investment offers which have been tabled by both sides were discussed in detail while discussions on financial services were paused for further reflection.  There were exploratory first discussions on the area of mutual recognition of professional qualifications.  On the regulatory cluster there were discussions with good progress reported across most sectors although significant technical work remains to be done.  On sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues both sides agreed to table texts before the 7th round.  Good discussions were reported on sustainable development and on the labour and environment areas.  There were also good discussions on energy and raw materials and on geographical indicators (GIs).<br\/><br\/>Both sides agreed to move forward and to work on preparing consolidated texts in the areas of State Owned Enterprises, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises, Customs and Trade Facilitation, Rules of Origin and Telecom Services and these texts will be made available to Member States through the reading room.  <br\/><br\/><b>Seventh Round<\/b><br\/><br\/>The 7th round took place from 29 September - 3 October 2014 in the US, where discussions were productive, and moving into negotiations based on specific textual proposals in some areas.<br\/><br\/>During this round, much of the focus was on the regulatory pillar of the future agreement.  All of the regulatory elements of TTIP were discussed, both in terms of horizontal disciplines (regulatory coherence, TBT, SPS) as well as on specific sectors identified in previous rounds such as pharmaceuticals, cars, chemicals or engineering.<br\/><br\/>On sectors, technical work made steady progress in identifying concrete outcomes that save unnecessary duplications while fully respecting the mandates of regulators on both sides.  This work was very much being guided by the regulators.  The regulatory part of TTIP has the potential to deliver the most benefits, but is also the most challenging part as it is highly technical and requires the most innovative thinking.<br\/><br\/>Three key considerations for negotiation discussions on the regulatory pillar concern standards, the strategic dimension, and compatibility.  On Standards, the EU made a firm commitment that nothing will be done which could lower or endanger the protection of the environment, health, safety, consumers or any other public policy goals pursued by EU or US regulators.  On the strategic dimension of these negotiations, enhanced regulatory cooperation is essential if the EU and US wish to play a leading role in developing international regulations and standards based on the highest levels of protection.  Finally, TTIP should deliver concrete results in terms of enhanced regulatory compatibility.<br\/><br\/>Other elements discussed were elements of the rules pillar of the agreement, energy and raw materials, customs and trade facilitation, intellectual property rights (IPR), small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), and services.<br\/><br\/>Prior to this round, both the US and the EU had put on the negotiating table their respective market access offers, and during this round negotiators devoted much of their time to explaining to each other, in detail, all the elements of the highly complex, and technical offers on Services. This is a key step as progress can only be made once each side has understood the scope of what the other has put on the table.  The EU&rsquo;s approach to services negotiations excludes any commitments on public services, and Member States remain free to decide at any time that certain services should be provided by the public sector.<br\/><br\/>The round also contained a day of stakeholder events, where the negotiators spent a full day engaging and exchanging views with representatives of civil society. These sessions with stakeholders have taken place during each negotiating round, and this time there were around 330 representatives of various interests and 64 presentations on all the areas covered by the negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800075#WRH04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800075#WRH04050"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[48992\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800075#WRH04100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of personnel that were employed in the trade division of his Department prior to March 2011; the number employed in that division at present, the responsibilities of his Department in relation to trade promotion; the responsibilities that have been transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>The Trade Division in my Department is made up of Trade Policy Unit, Export Licensing Unit and Bilateral Trade Unit.

In addition, and as the Deputy is aware, Russia introduced a ban on the import of agricultural products, including beef, from the EU in August of this yearWhile Russia is not a major destination for Irish beef exports, it does provide a useful alternative third country outlet for Irish beef, particularly beef offal. In 2013, Ireland exported 7,494 tonnes of beef worth a little under &euro;10 million to Russia, the majority of which related to beef offal. At the same time, Ireland produced approximately 520,000 tonnes of beef in total in 2013 and Bord Bia estimates that around 470,000 tonnes of this was exported. The main markets for Irish beef are the United Kingdom and continental Europe, two of the highest priced markets in the world. <br\/><br\/>Of course, it is important that we retain as many markets for Irish beef as possible, and the Russian market should be no exception to this.

One of the positive factors coming from the November figure is that there is evidence that milk suppliers are taking steps to manage their milk supply in the final months of the quota regime. This is evidenced by the fact that there was a 13% drop in the volume of milk delivered in November 2014 when compared to the same month last year. <i>I am heartened by this development and would encourage milk producers to continue this trend by <\/i>urging them to use the time period between now and the removal of milk quotas to identify, with their dairy adviser, steps to manage both their milk supply and their dairy herds so that they have an efficient herd as they enter the post quota era. <br\/><br\/><i>Working on the basis that farmers have commenced taking steps to adjust supplies up to next April <\/i><i>it is difficult to project what the quota position will be at year end.

It is my contention that while the positive underlying dynamic of increasing global population and demand remains, Irish and EU dairy farmers are vulnerable and acutely affected by temporary but significant market pressures. In such circumstances, instruments such as Aids to Private Storage, Intervention, Export Refunds and Exceptional Measures are designed to deal with periodic temporary troughs in price. These tools should be deployed, at the appropriate time, to ensure that they have maximum effect and that they place a real floor under the market, should that be necessary in the New Year.   <\/p><p>Private Storage schemes for butter, cheese and SMP have already been introduced by the Commission in September in a move which I both advocated and welcomed.

The service consists of quarterly independent assessments of my Department&rsquo;s ICT security measures and a biannual independent security review of my Department's ICT infrastructure. This is required for EU accreditation purposes in order to maintain my Department&rsquo;s status as the EU-accredited paying agency in Ireland. In addition, services for independent internet-facing application testing are provided for in the contract, where required.Following an open EU public tendering procedure held in April 2013, a contract for this work was awarded in June 2013. On this occasion it was awarded to a different company than on the previous occasion that this work was tendered. Following a review of the initial 12 month period of the contract, my Department and this company agreed to an extension of the contract for a further period of 12 months. On the expiry of this service in 2015, it is envisaged that my Department will run a new open EU tender competition for this ICT consultancy work.<br\/><br\/>My Department is also heavily reliant on high quality Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to both assist with the effective and efficient administration of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) based single payment and agri-environmental schemes and also in carrying out our animal health and farm inspection obligations. Following an open public tendering procedure held in 2012, my Department awarded a contract to Compass Informatics to carry out a review of the operation of the Department&rsquo;s GIS systems and to produce a technical report on how to ensure that these systems continue to serve my Department well into the future.

Prices rose steadily from &euro;3.22 a kilo at the start of January 2011 to an unprecedented peak of over &euro;4.40 per kilo in June of 2013, but declined to &euro;3.51 in September of 2014 before recovering to the current prices of &euro;3.77.  In looking at these changes, we cannot ignore normal supply and demand factors. This year we have slaughtered nearly 10% more animals than last year and over 18% on 2012.  Added to this supply increase, there has been a drop in Beef consumption throughout Europe. The combination of these points is clearly having an impact.<br\/><br\/>Putting structures in place to alleviate the impact of these price changes, and assisting farmers to be better prepared for these fluctuations, have been central to this Government&rsquo;s term in office.  The &euro;1.2 billion per year secured in direct payments each year forms a constant and secure income for farmers, and this is a particularly important buffer as prices fluctuate.  In addition, the need to ensure a viable future for the beef sector has been central to the draft &euro;4 billion Rural Development Plan submitted to the EU Commission in July.<br\/><br\/>The RDP includes a number of elements which will be of benefit to Beef farmers throughout the country, including the beef data and genomics measure which will be worth around &euro;300 million over a 6 year period and should bring about long term improvements to the sector though improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  Also, the continued support under the new agri-enviroment scheme GLAS and the &euro;195 million per year support for disadvantaged areas will be of significant benefit to beef farmers.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>Reducing input costs and improving efficiencies on farms has also been a key focus, and in this regard the funding by my Department to Teagasc, ICBF and Animal Health Ireland is critically important.  I have also been active in developing new market opportunities for Irish beef and in recent years markets such as Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran have been opened, and we are at an advanced stage in opening the US and Chinese markets and this process is ongoing.<br\/><br\/><i>Dairy<\/i><br\/><br\/>In respect of the dairy sector, prices are clearly a function of global market dynamics, with supply and demand issues in markets across the globe affecting prices across different dairy commodity groups in domestic markets.  Price volatility is a continuing feature of dairy commodity markets, and it is clear that managing the price peaks and troughs in a way that allows farmers and others to plan ahead is a significant challenge for the sector.  This issue was very much in focus at the recently held National Dairy Conference which I hosted in November.<br\/><br\/>The consensus emanating from the Conference based on numerous analyses is that the long-term fundamentals of global dairy market are strong and intact and that the Irish dairy sector is well placed to gain from the opportunities that will arise.  Notwithstanding this any objective analysis indicates that we are currently facing into a period of downward price movement following a prolonged period of high prices. Managing the impact of this kind of volatility, particularly on farmer suppliers, remains a key challenge. Market support measures will have a role and I have called on the EU Commission to deploy them as appropriate to support the markets. Processors and the lending sector will also have a role to play through measures such as fixed price contracts and flexible financing arrangements.<br\/><br\/>Some market support measures have already commenced.  Private Storage schemes for butter, cheese and SMP have already been introduced by the Commission in September in a move which I both advocated and welcomed.  The Schemes have been extended to the end February for butter and SMP.  The Private Storage scheme for cheese has been discontinued due to overuse by non Russian ban affected countries.  Furthermore the commencement date under which intervention will be available in 2015 has been advanced to 1 January.  These steps already taken by the Commission, some of which have been utilised in Ireland, are certainly welcome, but all possibilities, including a targeted export refund mechanism, or potentially an increase in the intervention rate, need to be considered.  In the context of Private Storage schemes, it is critically important to retain some flexibility around the release date to allow for market conditions.<br\/><br\/>In terms of tools to monitor the market and anticipate the volatility now inherent in it, it is obvious that any market analysis tools that contribute to our better understanding of the market and which facilitate policy makers in an underpinning of their actions with a clear evidentiary basis is to be welcomed.  The availability of timely and accurate market information is of course a critical success factor for in any effort to manage price volatility.  At EU level, the primary aim of the Milk Market Observatory (MMO), which was founded earlier this year, is to provide the EU dairy sector with more transparency by means of disseminating market data and short-term analysis in a timely manner.  At the most recent EU Council of Ministers meeting and along with a number of other like-minded Ministers, I stressed that the role played by European Milk Market Observatory is critical, noting that the challenge for the observatory is to ensure that the data is as close to real time as possible.  It is only through timely possession of this information that all of the actors in the sector will be able to respond appropriately with the measures required.  At that meeting the Commission indicated an openness to an examination as to how the MMO could be strengthened further including the provision of more relevant data and trend analysis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800080#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[49418\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800080#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the measures he will take to prevent dramatic reductions in the prices paid to producers in the dairy and beef sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p><i>Beef<\/i><br\/><br\/>As the Deputy will appreciate, questions of price are ultimately matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle.  It is neither appropriate nor possible for me or any other Minister for Agriculture in the EU, to intervene directly on these issues.  Indeed, the new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has emphasised this point again in recent weeks via correspondence directed to my Department.  Cattle prices are determined by supply - demand dynamics which are in turn influenced by a range of different factors such as consumer preferences, distance to market, consumer confidence, retail promotions, competition with other meats and the overall macroeconomic situation.<br\/><br\/>Nonetheless, it is vital that farmers are sufficiently remunerated for producing quality animals.  My role as Minister for Agriculture is to create a policy support environment that will allow the beef sector to flourish in line with normal market principles.  In the recent budget, I announced a total package of approximately &euro;74 million for the beef sector in 2015, including a provision of &euro;52 million for a proposed Beef Data and Genomics Programme which will place Ireland at the leading edge globally in the use of genomics in beef production.  The current Genomics Scheme is being further developed and enhanced as part of a 6-year RDP measure which, once approved by the European Commission, will deliver a payment per animal of &euro;100 for the first ten animals, with the remaining animals being eligible for an &euro;80 payment per animal in participating herds.  In 2014, I have brought forward a number of initiatives to help the sector, including the creation of the Beef Genomics Scheme with a budget of &euro;23 million in 2014. I have also ensured that the budgets of the Beef Data Programme and the Beef Technology Adoption Programme are retained at &euro;10 million and &euro;5 million which, when added to residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme, amounts to an investment of &euro;40m in 2014.<br\/><br\/>We have also had notable successes in securing new market opportunities for Irish beef in recent times, with Japan, Lebanon and Philippines opened in the last 12 months.  There has also been significant progress in securing market access to Canada, and I expect that Irish beef will be landing on supermarket shelves in the US next year.  In addition, Ireland secured a major breakthrough during my recent trade mission to China and, as a result of this, an inspection team from China has been hosted by my Department over the course of the last week or so.  This is an important step in securing access for Irish beef to that market. <br\/><br\/>I should also note recent agreement on a number of outcomes through the Beef RoundTable process.  This agreement addresses a range of the issues raised by farmers in recent months, particularly as regards market signals and product specifications.  The RoundTable also endorsed the development of Producer Organisations which should, in my view, go a long way to addressing negotiating power along the supply chain and ensure a fair return to beef producers over the medium to long term. <br\/><br\/>Finally, it should be noted that prices for R3 steers In Ireland have risen by 26 cents per kilo since the beginning of September.  This is an increase of over 7% during this period and Irish prices are now at 101% of the EU15 average price. <br\/><br\/><i>Dairy<\/i><br\/><br\/>As the Deputy is aware, dairy prices are a function of global market dynamics, with supply and demand issues in markets across the globe affecting prices across different dairy commodity groups in domestic markets.  Price volatility is a continuing feature of dairy commodity markets, and it is clear that managing the price peaks and troughs in a way that allows farmers and others to plan ahead is a significant challenge for the sector.<br\/><br\/>After two years of extremely high prices, the combination of strong production in key dairy producing countries, including the USA, New Zealand, Australia and the European Union, driven by good weather , increased cow numbers in the US and strong cereal harvests, has seen the emergence of a surplus in dairy products on international markets coming into 2015.  Furthermore, with Russia and China accounting for 27% of the traded world market in the dairy sector, the effect of surplus stocks in the Chinese market along with the displacement effect of the Russian ban can be seen as critical factors in setting the context for price evolution in the sector.<br\/><br\/>The anticipated decline in price in 2015 largely reflects the impact of the aforementioned developments on global dairy markets but that these negative results are expected to be temporary in nature. <br\/><br\/>Under the new Common Agriculture Policy there is a range of tools available to mitigate the worst impact of downward price volatility, including Aids to Private Storage, Intervention and Export Refunds and, as recently as earlier this week at the EU Council of Ministers meeting, I have called on the EU Commission to deploy these tools as appropriate.  The Single Farm Payment will also provide a measure of income stability during this difficult period.  I have also asked the banking sector to tailor their financial products to take account of the kind of price volatility that will be a feature of international dairy markets, and of course co-ops have a role to play in ensuring that their contractual arrangements with suppliers provide a requisite measure of stability.  A focus on innovation and the production of added value products will also have a role to play in mitigating the impact of volatility, and a greater use of futures markets may also feature among the tools deployed by the sector. <br\/><br\/>In terms of how this will evolve in the medium term, Teagasc, in common with a number of other commentators, anticipate that lower milk prices will lead to a slowdown in the expansion of milk production globally through 2015, with global dairy markets set to witness signs of recovery as the year progresses.  In the medium to longer term population growth and increasing affluence in developing countries will continue to drive strong growth in demand for dairy products, and I very much believe that Irish producers will be well placed to take full advantage of this demand. . <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800080#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[49419\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800080#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the new markets established for beef and dairy produce in the past four years; the extent to which prospects have improved in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p><i>Beef<\/i><br\/><br\/>My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues.  These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes over the past four years in securing agreement to import from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Namibia, The Philippines and New Caledonia. <br\/><br\/>Following a decision by the authorities in the US to lift the ban on the importation of beef from the European Union, the Federal State Inspection Service (FSIS) carried out an audit of Irish beef production controls in June 2014.  We received the draft final report of their visit recently and we continue to engage in order to complete the steps necessary to gain access for Irish beef to the US market.  My Department is working with the meat industry to advance the various technical requirements to ensure commencement of the trade at the earliest possible date.<br\/><br\/>In November 2014, I led a Trade Mission to China and I secured a commitment from the Chinese authorities to send an inspection team to Ireland to carry out on audit of Irish beef production controls, in particular with regards to BSE.  The inspection team arrived on the 10<sup>th<\/sup>of this month and is currently carrying out its programme.  While there are a number of stages to complete before Ireland secures access for beef to China, I am hopeful that the inspection visit currently under way will lead to significant progress on the issue.<br\/><br\/>There is a strong demand for beef globally and my focus is to continually seek to gain access to third country markets which will enable Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise. <br\/><br\/><i>Dairy<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>With respect to the dairy sector and whilst traditional markets such as the UK and the EU will naturally remain paramount for Irish dairy sector exports, it is abundantly clear that significant market opportunities exist for the sector in new markets outside the EU in the medium to long term horizon.  An examination of the export statistics in the sector gives a real sense of the emerging opportunities in new and exciting markets for Irish dairy produce.  In this regard the Deputy will already be aware that more than 85% of Irish dairy production is exported and Ireland exported dairy products to over 130 countries worldwide in 2013, with one third of the value of dairy exports going outside the EU.  In 2013, the value of dairy exports increased by 15 per cent to some &euro;3 billion for the first time.<br\/><br\/>It is abundantly clear that Ireland&rsquo;s high standards of food safety and environmental sustainability fundamentally underpin this success.  As Minister for Agriculture, I have recently witnessed firsthand the potential of the Chinese market in particular.  Ireland&rsquo;s dairy offering resonates with Chinese and other third-market consumers who place safety, traceability and sustainability at the core of their value proposition.  Companies based in Ireland exported almost &euro;300m worth of dairy produce to China in 2013 and the expectation for 2014 is that the figure will run approximately 25% ahead of last year.  This follows on from the positive announcement from Chinese authorities earlier this year in respect of the results of an audit of Ireland&rsquo;s dairy sector, which means that Irish plants have been found to fully meet the standards of new Chinese food safety laws.  This approval will allow the Irish dairy sector to build on their formidable reputation in international markets, and in the increasingly important Chinese market, and to further capitalise on Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for green, efficient, high quality dairy production.<br\/><br\/>Whilst an obvious and significant market, the dairy sector&rsquo;s new frontiers, in terms of development and consolidation, do reach beyond China.  For example, in 2013 Irish dairy exports to Nigeria were broadly compatible to exports to the United States.  Exports to Senegal outperformed exports to a number of Ireland&rsquo;s more traditional near-Europe trading partners.  These are examples used to highlight some of the new and exciting frontiers for the Irish Dairy sector.<br\/><br\/>I can assure the deputy that the development of international market opportunities for Irish Agri food products will continue to be a priority for my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800080#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sugar Industry","counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800080#WRL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[49420\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800080#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which progress is being made in respect of restoration of sugar production from sugar beet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":659,"content":"<p>In 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar\/bioethanol facility in the country.

In other words a food business operator at each and every stage in the food chain must be able to identify the source of its inputs as well as having details of the first recipient of its output.  This is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;one step forward one step backward&rdquo; traceability system.<br\/><br\/>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at stand-alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant.  The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks.  This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries.  In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. <br\/><br\/>Rules on the labelling of meat and meat products\u00a0are laid down in EU legislation.  For beef, the current rules require compulsory origin labelling, with place of birth, rearing and slaughter specified.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>In 2011, the European Union passed a new Council Regulation on Food Information for the Consumers (FIC), Regulation 1169\/2011, which will be implemented by way of EU Commission implementing regulations and has updated the requirements for consumer information and labelling in a number of areas, including as regards country of origin labelling for a range of products.  As of 1 April 2015, meat from swine, sheep, goats and poultry must be labelled with an indication as to where the animal was reared and where the animal was slaughtered.  My Department will, following a consultation process early next year, give effect to this requirement by way of a Statutory Instrument.  The FIC \u00a0also requires the European Commission to produce reports evaluating \u00a0the mandatory indication of origin or place of provenance for different products including milk, milk used as an ingredient in dairy products and ingredients that represent more than 50% of a food.  These reports may also be accompanied by proposals to modify the existing legal provisions. <br\/><br\/>The European Commission has already produced a report on meat used as an ingredient and the reports for the other products were due to be presented by 13 December 2014 but have not \u00a0yet been published by the European Commission. <br\/><br\/>The FSAI has advised my Department that the number of inspections where non compliance with labelling legislation were found over the last four years are as follows:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>-<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>9,919 (14.04%) <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011 <\/td><td>9,499 (15.98%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>9,415 (14.68%) <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>7,855 (14.63%) <\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>The majority of these were minor and remedial action was taken. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800080#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Policy","counter":666,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800080#WRL02900"},{"type":"question","counter":667,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[49423\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800080#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which the various habitat directives are seen to impact negatively on some parts of the agricultural sector; if such impact is deemed to impede the retention of family farm enterprises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":668,"content":"<p>Designations under the Habitats (and Birds) Directives are the responsibility of my colleague, Minister Humphreys, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

Almost 50,000 people participate in the sector.  In this regard, I was delighted to be in a position to provide a significant increase in funding to Horse Sport Ireland in the recent budget.  In addition, the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, which my Department submitted last July to the European Commission for approval, contains a proposal to establish Knowledge Transfer Groups in the equine sector.

The then Minister for Defence appointed a 14 person interim Board as a temporary measure in 2011 and in this context none of the positions were advertised. Legislation to dissolve the Board was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012. Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence. <\/p><p>  There were no appointments to the Board of Coiste an Asgard from 2009. In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. The formal wind up of the Company including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office was completed in early 2013.<\/p><p>  The only body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board. The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927. The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members. The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. <\/p><p>  There have been three appointments to the Army Pensions Board since March 2011. A serving officer was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011. This position became vacant in October 2014 due to the officer&rsquo;s deployment overseas. On the recommendation of the Chief of Staff a temporary appointment to the Board was made to cover the absence period of October 2014 to May 2015. As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, the position was not publicly advertised on either occasion that it was filled. Details of these appointments to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on 13 January 2012 and 4 November 2014 respectively.<\/p><p>  A civilian doctor was appointed as ordinary member of the Army Pensions Board in November 2013. The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website. A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and an appointment to the Board was made on foot of this public advertisement process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800081#WRM02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Requests","counter":734,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800081#WRM02800"},{"type":"question","counter":735,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[49241\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800081#WRM02900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will provide in tabular form per annum from 2009 to date in 2014 the total number of Freedom of Information requests received by his Department;

Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person, including taxi drivers or other individuals, to do so.<\/p><p>  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered specific issues relating to distance sales of intoxicating liquor in its 2008 Report. The Group drew attention to the requirement that payment must be made as part of the transaction in such cases, e.g. on-line shopping, and not later on delivery of the product. The Group noted that sales of intoxicating liquor which had been ordered by telephone or otherwise and which were paid for on delivery were illegal transactions and recommended that the Garda&iacute; should target such delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees.

A sentence of life imprisonment means that the prisoner is subject to that sentence for the rest of his or her life. Such a prisoner has no right to be released early at any stage. If granted temporary release, the prisoner remains subject to the life sentence and can be recalled to prison at any stage. Currently a person sentenced to life is, on average, likely to spend 17-18 years in prison before receiving any extended period of temporary release.  The offence of manslaughter does not attract a mandatory sentence but is punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in statute a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.<\/p><p>  The prescription of mandatory prison terms in legislation is an exception to this general approach.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Law Reform Commission 2013 Report on Mandatory Sentences, which recommends the repeal of existing presumptive mandatory minimum sentence provisions for various drugs and firearms offences. I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the Report on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in September, which recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences should be introduced.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800081#WRM05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Judicial Reviews","counter":765,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800081#WRM05900"},{"type":"question","counter":766,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[48946\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800081#WRM06000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to review the parole system (details supplied) in Ireland; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":767,"content":"<p>I published the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group on 17 September, 2014.<\/p><p>  The Report contains 43 recommendations, some of which can be implemented in the short to medium term, while others will require a more long term approach.

My Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission and it took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law.<\/p><p>  In England and Wales, for example, legislation makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high. Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012.<\/p><p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort. This reduces the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the further risk that court proceedings could leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department.<\/p><p>  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance.

However, I wish to advise the Deputies that it is not feasible to provide all the information sought by them in relation to appointments since March 2011 to State Boards under my remit.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the public advertising of vacancies and the qualifications of those appointed, the Deputies will be aware that there are many constraining factors which impact on the filling of vacancies to State Boards. Board vacancies are not always advertised on the Public Appointments Service (PAS). Many are advertised on the Department's website or the websites of the organisations concerned. The Deputies will also be aware that there are many cases where legislation requires that a vacancy must be filled by candidates holding certain qualifications or must be nominated by certain prescribed bodies and in such instances public advertisement of the vacancy is usually not necessary. Other than that I am not in a position to provide further information as in order to do so it would be necessary to disaggregate every single appointment made since 2011 and the resources are simply not available to undertake this task.  However, to the extent possible I have provided below a narrative account of the vacancies filled since 2011 and the manner in which they were filled.<br\/><br\/>The Deputies may wish to note that the term 'State Boards' is somewhat imprecise as it includes bodies with a wide and diverse range of functions many of which would not fall into the more commonly understood definition of Board which is a body with a governance oversight of an organisation.  To be of assistance to the Deputies I have interpreted his question as embracing all bodies called Boards, irrespective of their functions, as well as other bodies with a governance remit whose title does not include the term &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Charities Regulatory Authority Board<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>The Charities Regulatory Authority was established on 16 October 2014. A total of sixteen appointments have been made, all of which were drawn from the public advertisement process.

The position was not advertised as the appointment was made under Section 167(4)(a) of the Children Act 2001 as amended, which requires at least one officer of the Minister.  The person appointed was a civil servant.  <br\/><br\/>The Deputies should note that responsibility for the Children Detention Schools Board of Management moved to the Department for Children and Youth Affairs on 1 January 2012.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Classification of Films Appeal Board<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>The terms of office of the most recent iteration of the Classification of Films Appeal Board expired in April 2013 and accordingly there are nine vacancies to be filled.

The Independent Selection Panel forwarded its recommendation of fourteen names in March 2013. While the persons recommended could not be appointed to the IHREC in advance of the required legislation being enacted and commenced, the Government appointed fourteen individuals as members of the Human Rights Commission and subsequently they were appointed as members of the IHREC when the legislation was enacted, on a three-year and five-year basis to ensure that the terms of office of all members of the new Commission will not come to an end at the same time so as to preserve institutional continuity.<br\/><br\/>On 31 May, 2013, my predecessor Mr Alan Shatter, T.D. appointed twelve of their number to the Board of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended, on an interim basis of three years, but which expired when the Bill to establish the IHREC was enacted and commenced and the two Bodies were dissolved.<br\/><br\/>Emily Logan was nominated by PAS as Chief Commissioner of the IHREC and at a Government meeting on 18 July 2014 Ms. Logan was appointed on an interim basis as President of the Human Rights Commission pursuant to section 5 of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000.

It also found that children received a child-centred child protection and welfare service which supported them in the key decisions about their safety and welfare.  The report identifies issues whereby children identified as &lsquo;high priority&rsquo; were not allocated but later states that appropriate action was taken for all children deemed to be at immediate or serious risk.  Many of the deficits identified by HIQA related to factors that were outside of the immediate control of the service.

There is much work to be done and it is not without its challenges. Obviously, to deliver in full on our commitments in the Programme for Governments is of key importance and, in that context, the following will form part of my key priorities.<br\/><br\/>My most immediate priority is to establish and support a Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes. This is a complex subject and has required extensive consultation and very careful consideration. It is not a short-term project and will continue to require the support of the Government beyond our present term.<br\/><br\/>This government committed to fundamentally reforming the delivery of child and family welfare and child protection services, creating a dedicated Agency and reforming the model of service delivery. I will continue to work with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to support and progress a wide ranging programme of reform of child and family welfare and protection services<font color=\"#0082BF\">.<\/font>This is a huge undertaking, but I am heartened by knowing that in Gordon Jeyes, the Agency&rsquo;s CEO, and Norah Gibbons, Chair of the Tusla Board, we have the commitment and dedication we need to reform and transform services for children and families in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I intend to honour another Programme for Government commitment by enacting the Children First Bill, which will strengthen the child protection legislative framework in Ireland. <br\/><br\/>Since taking on the role of Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have been fortunate to meet many young people who spent time in care as a child. We know that the transition from living in care to independent living can be a very difficult one. Therefore I also aim to provide for a statutory right to an aftercare plan, so that we will have a clear sense of the needs of every young person as they embark on that transition. This week, Government approved a number of amendments to that legislation on foot of recommendations made by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, and I am grateful to the valuable work the Committee did in that regard.<br\/><br\/>The new National Children Detention Facilities at Oberstown will be completed shortly: construction work is being finalised, new staff are being recruited and trained. We will meet our Programme for Government commitment to end the practice of detaining children in prison facilities. To achieve that objective, I have received Government approval to make the necessary changes to the Children Act 2001. Amongst other things, this legislation will provide for the merging of the three existing Children Detention Schools into a single legal entity, and will also address a number of legal and policy issues associated with managing all children under the age of 18 on that site. I expect to publish and enact that legislation shortly.<br\/><br\/>I intend to launch Ireland&rsquo;s first ever Early Years Strategy creating an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector. Before finalising the strategy, I want to conduct a series of consultation meetings with a range of interests, so that I will have a better feeling for the views of stakeholders. I also intend to continue quality improvements in early years and child care services and to review existing targeted child care supports. It is crucial that we deliver high standards and transparency in this area, and that all parents have confidence in our early years sector. I am committed to maintaining the universal Early Childhood Care and Education programme, and am also examining the priorities for future investment in terms of the supply, accessibility and affordability of quality child care.<br\/><br\/>In relation to adoption services, work is continuing on the Heads of Bill for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill as soon as possible. The Bill aims to provide for structured and regulated access to information and contact for those affected by adoption. Significant legal and operational complexities arise in giving effect to this objective, but I am committed to realising as progressive an approach as possible.  Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration. I also hope to conclude a review of the Adoption Act 2010.<br\/><br\/>I have just announced the commencement of a consultation to ensure that all interests, including youth organisations and services, have the opportunity to input to a new National Youth Strategy. My Department is currently developing the strategy, which will be for all young people aged 10 to 24 years, having particular regard to young people experiencing or at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes and in most need of support. I intend to publish the new National Youth Strategy early in 2015.<br\/><br\/>A key concern in reforming services for children and families is the need to bring a greater focus on early intervention and prevention. The Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme was a key commitment of this Government aimed at tackling child poverty, building on and continuing the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme. I intend to develop an evaluation framework for the ABC Programme that will be overseen by an International Expert Advisory Group to build on the learning to date from the existing 13 programme sites. I also hope to develop a high-end mentoring initiative to support other sites who, while unsuccessful in the application stage for ABC, showed potential in terms of the design and delivery of effective evidence informed programmes.<br\/><br\/>Consistent with a preventative approach, the Deputy will be aware that the Protection of Children's Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Bill 2012 completed its passage in the Oireachtas today (18 December 2014). The new law, once commenced, will ban smoking in cars where children are present. I wish to thank all those who worked on that legislation, particularly Senators Jillian Van Turnhout, John Crown, and Mark Daly. Similarly, I am determined to secure the passage of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014. This legislation will effectively remove the last billboard for tobacco products &ndash; the cigarette box itself &ndash; and I passionately believe it will reduce the number of children and young persons starting to smoke. <br\/><br\/>In April of this year, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young people was launched. The document is a milestone in developing a coordinated, government-wide set of actions to provide a better future for our children and young people. It is the first national policy framework that spans the age range of 0 to 24 years, bringing together policies for all children and young people right across government. As a third of the Irish population is aged between 0 and 24, the scale of the task speaks for itself. I have established an Advisory Council, with a range of independent experts and leading representatives from NGOs, to leverage engagement with the whole of society to move this agenda on. In 2015, it is a key priority of mine and my department, to work with the Advisory Council and my government colleagues to implement the wide range of actions set out in the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures<\/i>framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800083#WRO04400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Caf&eacute;s Expenditure","counter":916,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800083#WRO04450"},{"type":"question","counter":917,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[49094\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800083#WRO04500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide in tabular form, by county, the funding his Department has provided for youth caf&eacute;s every year since 2011.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":918,"content":"<p>In recent years there has been a significant investment in the development of youth caf&eacute; facilities in Ireland and capital funding has been made available to my Department for these facilities. <\/p><p>  In 2013 a capital allocation of &euro; 1.5m was made available to my Department for a new Youth Caf&eacute; scheme.

It should be noted that in 2012 my Department reviewed the funning provided to each City and County Childcare Committee relative to the numbers of children and services within the area and the level of deprivation.  Following that exercise, it was found that some committees were relatively over funded and others relatively underfunded.  A new Framework for allocations to CCCs was developed and is now being implemented.  For the period 2013 and 2014, therefore, the allocations were adjusted so that relatively overfunded committees had a greater reduction in funding than those that are relatively underfunded. <br\/><br\/><b>City and County Childcare Committees - Funding<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>2011 Funding<\/th><th>2012 Funding<\/th><th>2013 Funding<\/th><th>2014 Funding<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>268,510<\/td><td>268,000<\/td><td>244,000<\/td><td>224,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>268,510<\/td><td>268,000<\/td><td>248,000<\/td><td>234,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>329,501<\/td><td>329,000<\/td><td>313,000<\/td><td>304,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td>333,832<\/td><td>333,000<\/td><td>308,000<\/td><td>299,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County<\/td><td>482,905<\/td><td>482,000<\/td><td>482,000<\/td><td>482,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>370,369<\/td><td>370,000<\/td><td>363,000<\/td><td>363,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>790,390<\/td><td>790,000<\/td><td>774,000<\/td><td>774,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin - Dun Laoghaire Rathdown<\/td><td>405,719<\/td><td>405,000<\/td><td>385,000<\/td><td>373,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin - Fingal<\/td><td>469,537<\/td><td>469,000<\/td><td>460,000<\/td><td>460,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin - South Dublin<\/td><td>482,905<\/td><td>482,000<\/td><td>472,000<\/td><td>472,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway City &amp;amp; County<\/td><td>463,750<\/td><td>463,000<\/td><td>454,000<\/td><td>454,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>365,913<\/td><td>365,000<\/td><td>354,000<\/td><td>347,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>405,719<\/td><td>405,000<\/td><td>393,000<\/td><td>385,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>277,117<\/td><td>277,000<\/td><td>263,000<\/td><td>255,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>264,233<\/td><td>264,000<\/td><td>244,000<\/td><td>230,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>249,429<\/td><td>249,000<\/td><td>227,000<\/td><td>209,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick City<\/td><td>261,196<\/td><td>261,000<\/td><td>241,000<\/td><td>227,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick County<\/td><td>365,913<\/td><td>365,000<\/td><td>338,000<\/td><td>319,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>249,753<\/td><td>249,000<\/td><td>227,000<\/td><td>209,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>329,502<\/td><td>329,000<\/td><td>313,000<\/td><td>304,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>329,017<\/td><td>329,000<\/td><td>319,000<\/td><td>313,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>401,264<\/td><td>401,000<\/td><td>389,000<\/td><td>381,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>268,187<\/td><td>268,000<\/td><td>248,000<\/td><td>234,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>277,117<\/td><td>277,000<\/td><td>256,000<\/td><td>241,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>268,511<\/td><td>268,000<\/td><td>248,000<\/td><td>234,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>268,510<\/td><td>268,000<\/td><td>248,000<\/td><td>234,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary North<\/td><td>268,511<\/td><td>268,000<\/td><td>248,000<\/td><td>234,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary South<\/td><td>281,573<\/td><td>281,000<\/td><td>260,000<\/td><td>245,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford City<\/td><td>268,510<\/td><td>268,000<\/td><td>244,000<\/td><td>224,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford County<\/td><td>268,511<\/td><td>268,000<\/td><td>248,000<\/td><td>234,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>277,226<\/td><td>277,000<\/td><td>256,000<\/td><td>241,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>370,369<\/td><td>370,000<\/td><td>359,000<\/td><td>352,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>333,958<\/td><td>334,000<\/td><td>317,000<\/td><td>307,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>+<\/td><td>11,315,967<\/td><td>334,000<\/td><td>317,000<\/td><td>307,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>&euro;11,315,967<\/td><td>&euro;11,300,000<\/td><td>&euro;10,743,000<\/td><td>&euro;10,398,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800084#WRP00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Career Breaks","counter":929,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800084#WRP00550"},{"type":"question","counter":930,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[49121\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800084#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide in tabular form, the number of staff in his Department currently on a sabbatical-career break broken down by zero to six months, six to 12 months, one to two years, two to three years, four to five years and more than 5 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with these procedures, the NCPE conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website ().<br\/><br\/>On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes.

The revised Project Brief also took account of the outcome of a review of the location, model and number of urgent care centres which was undertaken in 2013. Following that review, which involved significant consultation with the relevant stakeholders, it was decided that satellite centres, which will share governance and staffing with the new children's hospital, will be built on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.   <\/p><p>  The Project Brief was approved in June 2014 and sets out details of the specialties to be provided and the planned accommodation.

There will be 111 outpatient consulting examination rooms across both the main hospital and the two satellite centres, as well as ED and urgent care facilities.<\/p><p>  The design team is now working on detailed design development, with the aim of submitting a planning application in June 2015.  Subject to planning, work will commence at the main site at St. James's, and at satellite centre sites at Connolly and Tallaght, in January 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800085#WRQ04700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":1062,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800086#WRR00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1063,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[48918\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800086#WRR00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to set out the position regarding the provision of free general practitioner care for those under six years and those over 70; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1064,"content":"<p>The Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, which provides an entitlement for all children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees, was enacted on 25th July 2014.

I also spent time in the Emergency Department speaking to management, staff and patients, as I am well aware of the challenges which are faced by Emergency Departments, including Beaumont's, particularly at this time of year.<\/p><p>  In relation to Beaumont in particular, the management has implemented a number of initiatives to address the obvious egress issues and enhance patient flow from the Emergency Department to discharge or to in-patient beds. These measures include:<\/p><p>- patient pathways in place for transferring patients quickly to the Acute Medicine Unit and to the Stroke Unit<\/p><p>- rapid access to diagnostics such as endoscopy, ECHO and stress tests to assist with rapid diagnosis and treatment of patients<\/p><p>- provision of minor injuries service by Advance Nurse Practitioners (ANPs) from 8am to 9pm, seven days per week<\/p><p>- provision of a direct consult chest pain service by a Cardiology ANP three days per week.<\/p><p>  Two &lsquo;self-harm&rsquo; nurse specialists, a clinical nurse specialist for liaison psychiatry and alcohol liaison nurse service assist in the work of the Emergency Department by providing specific expertise to support patients with these presentations.  In addition, the hospital established a dedicated rapid assessment team this year, incorporating a senior doctor, clinical nurse manager, staff nurse and healthcare assistant. These resources have been assigned to the ED assessment area in order to improve non-admitted patient experience times (PETs).  Beaumont is engaged with Clinical programmes and care pathways including the Hospital Design Programme and the National Acute Coronary Syndrome Programme which will further improve the current situation. These longer term measures are supported by short term measures such as cancellation of elective activity and redirection of patients who do not require acute interventions to appropriate alternative care pathways.<\/p><p>  The HSE and my Department are working hard in order to alleviate the unacceptable pressures experienced by patients and staff alike in ED Departments.  To assist in this situation, the HSE Service Plan for 2015 includes &euro;25 million to specifically address delayed discharges.<\/p><p>  An extra &euro;3 million was allocated in this year's recent Supplementary Budget for Health to allow the delayed discharge initiative to start this year, rather than next year as originally intended.  1,000 Fair Deal Nursing Home Support Scheme places have been approved to help address the number of delayed discharges. The funding has also facilitated the allocation of  Home Care packages and the provision of Transitional Care beds for patients who do not yet have a long term care place or an appropriate support package in place to allow patients return home. A number of patients who had been awaiting discharge from Beaumont have been able to leave hospital as a result.<\/p><p>  At a national level, hospitals have been working with the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) on Winter Planning initiatives to address the anticipated seasonal surge arising principally from changing weather conditions.  However, the successful management of access to emergency and acute care cannot be solely dependent on intensive, short term solutions.  I am establishing an Emergency Department Taskforce to develop such solutions. It will meet for the first time on 22 December and monthly thereafter in order to address solutions to problems being experienced by Emergency Departments, with the emphasis on those which are experiencing the greatest levels of difficulty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800086#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Services Provision","counter":1086,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800086#WRR01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1087,"qnumday":384,"qnumall":"[48961\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800086#WRR01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to outline his plans to upgrade the accident and emergency department in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1088,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

I have publicly condemned recent Israeli government announcements of further settlement expansion, and called for these decisions to be reversed.<\/p><p>  Ireland has consistently pressed the European Union to focus on settlements as a key element to be addressed if a Middle East peace agreement is to be achieved, and argued for stronger action on the issue. This could include both more emphatic public and diplomatic messaging, and action on specific aspects of the settlement programme, such as land seizures, evictions and demolitions of Palestinian facilities.<\/p><p>  Settlement products are one such aspect, although their importance should not be overestimated. Most settlements are dormitory communities which produce little or nothing for export, and a complete ban on settlement goods would not significantly affect the overall project.<\/p><p>  The EU has already taken a number of actions. Most importantly, settlement goods attract a higher import duty than goods from Israel, Palestine or many other places. EU research grants may not be spent in settlements. The EU does not accept Israeli veterinary certification of meat from settlements. Many EU members, including Ireland, advise their citizens against investing or buying property in settlements. The EU has been examining the question of labelling of settlement products, and I have pressed for that to be moved forward.<\/p><p>  Ireland has stated that we would support the full exclusion of settlement products from the EU.

Over the years 2011 to 2014, my Department has not incurred expenditure on external public relations and communications services. Although it has been our practice not to engage the services of external public relations firms, we have from time to time commissioned consultants or companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management.<br\/><br\/>DHR Communications is the only company which has been contracted since 2010, to manage and administer grants under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and Africa Day celebrations.<br\/><br\/>The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year and managing the SCMF student competition.

This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.  DHR was awarded a two-year contract to 2012 and was re-engaged in February 2012 for a further two years following a competitive tendering process.  The contract was extended in 2014 for a further year.<br\/><br\/>Following a competitive tendering process, DHR was also engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day flagship event in Dublin. This includes the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which DHR managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website. This &lsquo;public relations&rsquo; work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.<br\/><br\/>Africa Day Family Days, incorporating musical entertainment, cultural activities and an African Bazaar, were hosted by the Department in Iveagh Gardens in 2009 and 2010, in CHQ in Georges Dock in 2012 and at the Farmleigh Estate in 2013 and 2014. In 2011, the Department supported a series of smaller-scale performances, family events, art exhibitions, debates and educational activities instead of hosting a flagship event.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed below. This included expenditure on security, sanitation, venue set-up, health and safety issues and small grants to facilitate the participation of community groups.<br\/><br\/>DHR also provided short-term management support services for the Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid, including the logistical management of the nationwide public consultation activities.<br\/><br\/>The table below sets out the payments to DHR since 2011.  <br\/><br\/><b>Payments to DHR Communication for Project and Event Management 2011 to 2014<\/b><table><tr><th>Name of Project\/Event<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014 (estimate)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>SCMF<\/td><td>&euro;73,237<\/td><td>&euro;47,430<\/td><td>&euro;73836<\/td><td>&euro;55,227<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>White Paper Review<\/td><td>&euro;25,000<\/td><td>&euro;26,026<\/td><td>nil<\/td><td>nil<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Africa Day<\/td><td>&euro;6,806<\/td><td>&euro;90,851<\/td><td>&euro;118,644<\/td><td>&euro;143,829<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>&euro;105,043<\/td><td>&euro;164,307<\/td><td>&euro;192,480<\/td><td>&euro;199,056<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800089#WRU04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800089#WRU04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1312,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[49172\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800089#WRU04200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the total amount spent on external IT consultants by his Department in 2010 to 2013, inclusive, and to date in 2014;

Travel and meetings often take place out of hours and away from the officer&rsquo;s headquarters leading to subsistence and\/or taxi requirements. The central aim of the Departmental travel policy is to minimise official travel costs and to achieve value for money for expenditure necessarily incurred, consistent with the effective discharge of official duties.<br\/><br\/>The Department complies with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circulars in relation to subsistence payments, including reimbursement of taxi costs.  The Department is subject to audit by both the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department&rsquo;s Internal Audit function.<br\/><br\/>In September 2014 the Revenue Commissioners commenced an audit of my Department. Prior to this audit my Department reviewed findings of similar audits of other Government Departments previously undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners.  On that basis my Department undertook a review of certain expenditure for the period to be audited. Based on this review my Department made a voluntary declaration to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to certain taxi costs where it was considered that there was an additional tax liability.<br\/><br\/>The Revenue audit covered the period 1 January 2012 to 31 July 2014.  On the completion of the Revenue audit in November 2014 my Department made a payment of &euro;33,570.12 in respect of taxes, interest and penalties.<br\/><br\/>This settlement comprises &euro;22,340.97 in respect of under paid PAYE; &euro;5,614.36 under paid Employer PRSI; &euro;2,820.23 interest on late payment and &euro;2,794.56 penalties. Because of the voluntary declaration the Revenue applied a penalty rate of 10%.<br\/><br\/>The settlement covers the following areas:<br\/><br\/>1. Taxis &euro;26,660.90 - this relates to taxi journeys between officers&rsquo; home and headquarters. In accordance with Departmental policy officers who come in before 07:00 and leave after 21:00 may use a taxi.  Under tax legislation travel between home and headquarters gives rise to a Benefit in Kind tax liability.<br\/><br\/>2. Interview Boards &euro;2,679.65 - while the Department deducted withholding tax from payments to individual board members the Revenue have advised that these payments should be processed through payroll. This would result in the Department paying Employers PRSI.<br\/><br\/>3. Payments to two retired staff taken back to undertake project work &euro;4,229.57 - while the Department deducted withholding tax from payments to these individuals the Revenue have advised that these payments should be processed through payroll.  This would result in the Department paying Employers PRSI.<br\/><br\/>As a result of the Revenue Commissioners audit, my Department has introduced new procedures for processing payments to external members on interview boards and retired civil servants returning to work on contract; and to applying tax on official taxis costs taken by officers between headquarters and home in accordance with Revenue regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800089#WRU06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":1334,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800089#WRU06400"},{"type":"question","counter":1335,"qnumday":470,"qnumall":"[49341\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800089#WRU06500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the total legal costs incurred by his Department in 2011, 2012, 2013 and estimated in 2014.","asker":"1101","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1336,"content":"<p>My Department is responsible for two Votes, Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs and Trade) and Vote 27 (International Cooperation).

This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. <br\/><br\/>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected.<br\/><br\/>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  This Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities and the purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  On 20 May 2014, the <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness<\/i>was published in which the Government's approach to delivery on its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined.

Tenants must be given 28 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent. These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement.\u00a0 However, a recent Red C poll for the PRTB found that only 64% of tenants were aware of their rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. The PRTB is developing a new communications strategy, which will include increasing awareness of existing rights and obligations under the legislation and will be rolled out early in 2015.<br\/><br\/>In the third quarter of 2014, rents were 5.6% higher nationally than the same period last year, according to the most recent rent index from the PRTB. Rents for houses were 4.3% higher, while apartment rents were 7.3% higher than in the same quarter of 2013. The index shows that nationally, monthly rents were over 17% lower than their peak in late 2007, with Dublin rents 9.4% lower than the peak.<br\/><br\/>Ultimately, the main cause of rising rents is a lack of supply in the market and the recently published <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list including homeless households.  The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units will address the needs of the 90,000 on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.

Regulation 7 relates to effective heating which can be independently managed by the tenant, while Regulation 8 provides for sole access to adequate facilities for the hygienic storage, preparation and cooking of food. The 2008 Regulations came into effect generally on 1 February 2009 but allowed a four year phasing-in period to facilitate any improvement works that needed to be carried out in respect of Regulations 6, 7 and 8.  The revised standards in the 2008 Regulations were based on a review of minimum standards dating back to 1993 which tolerated very basic facilities such as external toilets, cold water only and having an open fireplace as the only heating source.

The 2004 Act provides that rents may not be greater than the open market rate and may only be reviewed upward or downward once a year unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review. Tenants must be given 28 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent. These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement.  In the third quarter of 2014, rents were 5.6% higher nationally than the same period last year, according to the most recent rent index from the PRTB. Rents for houses were 4.3% higher, while apartment rents were 7.3% higher than in the same quarter of 2013. In Dublin, which is seeing the highest rates of increase nationally, overall rents were higher by 9.5%.<br\/><br\/>A recent Red C poll for the PRTB found that only 64% of tenants were aware of their rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.

The FSC certifies that the building, if constructed in accordance with the plans and documentation submitted, will comply with the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations. It is an offence to open, occupy or use a building without having a valid FSC where one is required.<\/p><p>  While the above requirement for an FSC remains in place, the Building Control Regulations have been amended by S.I. No. 9 of 2014 which greatly strengthened the arrangements in place for the control of building activity. In particular, the regulations empower competence and professionalism in design and construction and require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations, including the Fire Safety requirements addressed in Part B of the regulations. Statutory certificates of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspection during construction and validation and registration of statutory certificates are now formally required in respect of all new buildings, including apartments, housing developments and one-off housing. As with an FSC, it is an offence to open, occupy or use a building for which a statutory certificate of completion is required and has not been included on the public building control register. <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the regulatory framework now in place represents a reasonable and appropriate response to the many building failures that occurred in the past decade and will lead to improved quality within the construction sector. Firstly, statutory certification brings greater legal clarity. Any builder or construction professional who now signs a statutory certificate in respect of a dwelling which subsequently proves to be non-compliant can be held legally liable for the consequences of his\/her actions. Secondly, there is a greater onus now placed on professionals to provide consumers with a more comprehensive service. In this regard, any registered construction professional that is found guilty of misconduct runs the risk of being censured, suspended or ultimately removed from the relevant statutory register. Thirdly, the mandatory inspection plan guarantees oversight by a competent profession during the construction phase. Fourthly, the lodgement of project documentation on the online Building Control Management System facilitates closer monitoring of activity by the local building control authority. Finally, building owners and occupiers of new dwellings will henceforth have the right to access compliance documentation relevant to their home lodged with the local Building Control Authority ,   which will greatly assist them in identifying and pursuing the responsible party should problems occur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800092#WRX03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":1513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800092#WRX03950"},{"type":"question","counter":1514,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[49077\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800092#WRX04000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the way persons with impaired mobility are able to find their way in the built up environment of many local authorities; if he will ensure the full implementation of the Disability Act 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1515,"content":"<p>My Department has supported local authorities in implementing the Disability Act 2005 since its enactment.

No. 9 of 2014 have greatly strengthened the arrangements in place for the control of building activity by requiring accountability for compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates. I am satisfied that this key reform of the regulatory framework represents a reasonable and appropriate response to the many building failures that occurred in the past decade and will lead to improved quality within the construction sector. <br\/><br\/>The main concern of families intending to build their own homes remains the question of cost. A number of cases have been brought to my attention whereby consumers have been quoted exorbitant charges for professional services in relation to residential construction projects. While the new regulations support improved competence and professionalism and while I believe it is worthwhile for homeowners to have the home they invest in checked and inspected, I do not believe that they should be faced with inflated charges or excessive inspection services.<br\/><br\/>An extensive public consultation process was undertaken in 2012 to inform the development of the new regulations. Comprehensive consultation documents were published including <i>Strengthening the Building Control System - A Document to inform public consultation on Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012<\/i>which sets out the context in which the new regulations will operate and their impact with particular relevance to cost on building owners and industry stakeholders.<br\/><br\/>In summary terms, the consultation document identified the key cost impact of the new regulations on owners as being the requirement to assign a competent registered professional to inspect and certify the works. While costs are ultimately determined by market forces, it was considered that this particular requirement would add approximately &euro;3,000 to the overall building cost of a dwelling.<br\/><br\/>While compliant design and construction was a statutory obligation under the Building Control Act 1990, this obligation may not always have been honoured to the full extent in an under-regulated market. On this basis, it was recognised that the revised regulations may result in additional design, inspection, ancillary certification and, possibly, insurance costs which must ultimately be borne by the building owner. In return for such additional investment owners would be assured of an enhanced quality of design and construction of the building project concerned. It was also noted that the statutory inspection and certification process would reduce the incidence of defective works and the resultant associated costs of carrying out remedial works would reduce accordingly. <br\/><br\/>In response to the concerns about the prices being quoted to consumers, my Department, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and the construction professional bodies, is preparing additional guidance on an appropriate inspection plan for a typical one-off dwelling. Such guidance will be helpful in better informing the market in relation to offering realistic and appropriately priced professional services for such work. <br\/><br\/>Early in the New Year, the Department will commence its review of the first year of operation of the regulations in conjunction with local authorities and industry stakeholders. The impact, particularly in relation to cost, of the regulations on one-off housing will be a key element of this review which will inform future regulation in this critical area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800092#WRX04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":1520,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800092#WRX04450"},{"type":"question","counter":1521,"qnumday":543,"qnumall":"[49107\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800092#WRX04500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when the forthcoming planning policy statement will be published; the way it will feed into legislation currently being drafted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1522,"content":"<p>I intend to shortly publish a non-statutory Planning Policy Statement to act as a general guiding document to the operation of the planning system.

The preparation of a draft Initial Assessment (under Art. 8 of the MSFD) including proposals for Good Environmental Status (Art. 9) and for draft Environmental Targets (Art.10) will be underpinned by a suite of monitoring measures which will measure the maritime environment against these targets (Art. 11).<br\/><br\/>(4) This report was co-funded by my Department and the Private Residential Tenancies Board.

Energy and broadband connectivity are amongst the most strategic sectors of the Irish economy and are clearly reflected in the strategy for economic and social recovery set out in the Statement.<br\/><br\/>The statement identifies the promotion of investment in indigenous energy production, reduction of emissions, improvement of security of supply and creation of jobs as overriding objectives. In doing so we need to be cognisant of energy cost competitiveness, while anchoring Irish energy policy in the three pillars of EU Energy policy. In the area of broadband, I have recently published a Connecting Communities public consultation on a national map showing the expected commercial availability of high speed broadband by 2016 and identifying the area that the national broadband plan itself needs to cover.

This will form the underlying basis of the work of my Department for the remainder of this Government's term of office. In particular, the commemoration to mark the hundredth anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising is a major priority for me.  On the 12 November 2014, the launch took place of <i>Ireland 2016, <\/i>a national initiative led by my Department, to mark the anniversary of the Easter Rising in an inclusive, respectful and appropriate way. This programme is underpinned by the &euro;4 million I secured in the recent budget, which will support a wide range of activities and events by interested groups, including local community groups and the arts community. This is in addition to the &euro;22m capital provision allocated in 2015 for a number of flagship commemorative projects.<br\/><br\/>Another important priority for me is to deliver Ireland's first national cultural policy.  Last June, an agreement was reached to draft a national cultural policy called Culture 2025.  It will set out the high-level aims and policies in the area of culture for the period up to 2025.  This is the first time in the history of the State that a Government has undertaken such an endeavour.  My Department is finalising a draft discussion paper. Following the publication of this I will initiate a wide-scale consultation process early in the New Year to ensure all can make their views known.<br\/><br\/>It is also my intention to publish the National Concert Hall Bill early in the New Year which will place the National Concert Hall on a statutory footing and update its governance and accountability arrangements. To-day, I received the pre-legislative scrutiny report from the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, following its public hearing held on the 30 September 2014.<br\/><br\/>It is very important to me that the arts are made more accessible.  Immersing school students in the arts through a targeted strategy will benefit future generations and give young people a greater understanding and appreciation of the arts as they progress to adulthood.  I have met my colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on a number of occasions to discuss the Arts in Education Charter. We are both very keen to progress implementation of the Charter without delay to promote the arts among children and young people.<br\/><br\/>It will remain a key objective for my Department to maximise the economic and employment creation potential of the arts, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors. In this context, it will seek to continue to develop synergies between the arts, cultural, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors, most notably in the area of tourism product development and cultural tourism. The finalisation of the National Peatlands Strategy in 2015 is a key objective in this area and my Department will also continue its work with stakeholders to implement the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language.<br\/><br\/>Finally, I look forward to working for the promotion of North\/South co-operation in the context of the remit of my Department and, in particular, through the work of the North South Implementation Bodies that my Department co-funds &ndash; Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800097#WRCC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":1738,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800097#WRCC02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1739,"qnumday":621,"qnumall":"[49108\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121800097#WRCC02800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when the final national landscape strategy will be published and implemented; the legislative proposals she envisages to provide statutory effect to its provisions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1740,"content":"<p>A draft National Landscape Strategy for Ireland 2015-2025 was approved by Government on the 1 July 2014.
