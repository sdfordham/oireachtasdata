In the last 5 years in particular, Ireland has made huge strides in accelerating renewable generation. In the 2001 European RES-E Directive, Ireland was set a target of moving from 3.6% RES-E to 13.2% RES-E by 2010. Ireland achieved 14.8% RES-E in 2010 and exceeded the EU target of 13.2% in 2010.<\/p><p>Directive 2009\/28\/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources was published in June 2009. The Directive aims to ensure that by 2020, 20% of all energy consumed in the EU is from renewable sources covering heat, electricity and transport.<\/p><p>The target addressed to Ireland is 16% of all energy consumed to be sourced from renewable energy by 2020. The electricity market is approximately 33% of the energy target. Ireland&rsquo;s national target for 2020 has been set as 40% of electricity must come from renewable sources (RES-E).  Also, this converts to 10% of energy in the transport and 12% of energy in the heat sector must come from renewable sources.<\/p><p><b>Electricity <\/b><\/p><p>The electricity market is the most mature of the national support programmes. Support commenced in the mid-1990s based on competitive tendering under the Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) programme.  The more successful feed in tariff support mechanism (REFIT) replaced AER from September 2007.<\/p><p>The primary support mechanism for renewable electricity is REFIT (Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff), which is designed to provide certainty to renewable electricity generators by providing them with a minimum floor price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a 15 year period.  This certainty afforded by a guaranteed minimum price gives them sufficient certainty to be able to get loans to finance the renewable developments.  REFIT 2, launched last year, is designed around interacting with the market price.<\/p><p>The increasing contribution from renewable energy technologies to the electricity market are summarised in the following table energy<\/p><p><table><tr><th>'04<\/th><th>'05<\/th><th>'06<\/th><th>'07 <\/th><th>'08 <\/th><th>'09<\/th><th>'10<\/th><th>'11<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>5.2%<\/td><td>6.8%<\/td><td>8.6%<\/td><td>9.5%<\/td><td>11.9%<\/td><td>14.1%<\/td><td>14.8%<\/td><td>17.6%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><b>Technologies employed <\/b><\/p><p>There are 2000 megawatts (MW), approx., of installed generating plant harnessing renewable energy technologies.  The dominant technology developed in recent times is onshore wind power ca 1696 MW with a lesser amount of biomass, mainly landfill gas. Hydropower contributes approximately 238 MW of installed capacity.  On an electricity system of the order of 6000 MWs of installed capacity, wind now represents approximately 30% of the total installed capacity.<\/p><p>It was estimated a total of 1650 MW of installed renewable capacity was required to achieve the 15% renewable electricity target.  There were sufficient projects with both planning permission and a connection offer to deliver this target with onshore wind remaining dominant.  The latest figures from EirGrid show that there is a further 1,582 MW with signed connection agreements or in the final stages of agreeing one.<\/p><p><b>Microgeneration<\/b><\/p><p>Should a microgeneration scheme be introduced, if this to be funded from the PSO levy, increased electricity costs would have to be borne by all customers to fund it.

The Strategy will focus on the key areas of <b>connectivity<\/b>, <b>capability<\/b>, <b>content<\/b> and <b>community<\/b>   and it is my objective that with continued private and public investment in broadband infrastructure combined with increased skills and knowledge and the rapid development of more applications we can create significantly increased levels of digital participation among all sectors of society.<\/p><p><br \/>  The NDS should be seen as a further element of the Government's overall approach to fostering increased access to and use of digital services, complementing as it does the existing National Broadband Plan, last year's e-Government Strategy and the recent National Payments Plan.<\/p><p><br \/>  The trading on-line element of the Strategy will also complement the disruptive reform initiative in this area which is included in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs.<\/p><p><br \/>  To help drive and deliver these ambitious objectives, last December I appointed David Puttnam as our first national Digital Champion.  We are lucky to have such a passionate, articulate and influential advocate for the possibilities of digital, particularly in the education sector.  Working with the Department, he will be engaging with the various sectors over the coming months, with a view to driving the digital agenda and specifically pursuing some key goals that will be set out in the National Digital Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000053#WRA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gas and Electricity Disconnections","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000053#WRA02450"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[20193\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000053#WRA02500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of disconnections from electricity\/natural gas there have been in the past year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1028","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity market, including disconnections, is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory regulator.

There is potential for maximising synergies while addressing the possible trade-offs between competitiveness, security of supply and sustainability.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Commissioner Oettinger attended the Informal Meeting.  He highlighted how any new framework should take into account current economic difficulties whilst remaining ambitious on the long-term low carbon objective.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The Council of Energy Ministers also discussed the effects of unconventional oil and gas on energy supply, competitiveness and prices.  In relation to the work currently underway by the European Commission on unconventional hydrocarbon extraction, the Irish Presidency requested that the Commission would reflect on the debate among Ministers in Dublin, particularly on the global competitiveness and security of supply aspects, and to take those views into consideration in their work on the matter, having regard to legitimate environmental and safety considerations.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The two days of discussions were informed by the goal of full implementation of the internal energy market. Ministers agreed that this is not an end in itself, but rather, it must bring tangible benefits to all energy consumers.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">On the issue of the links between smart technology, innovation and energy policy, I concluded that the ultimate objective in rolling out standardised smart meters and smart grids across Europe must be value and benefit driven, with a specific consumer focus. In so doing, we must recognise the energy needs, circumstances and IT capabilities of all categories of consumers.  Data protection concerns should also be considered and addressed.  The need for public awareness campaigns on the potential advantages was acknowledged and the benefits must be clear to all individual energy customers and management of energy consumption. Product and price analysis must be simple and straightforward.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The financing of energy efficiency measures was also discussed. Realising the energy efficiency potential of buildings is central to the EU's energy efficiency policy.  Nearly 40% of final energy is consumed in homes, offices and shops. The challenge that Energy Ministers face is to find the necessary finance to underpin the energy retrofit renovation that is required as part of our 2020 energy and climate goals.  This is particularly important given the potential for jobs and growth that a sustained campaign of energy efficiency in buildings would realise.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The integration of variable renewable energy sources, in particular wind and solar energy, was also discussed and the Ministers agreed that the proper development of energy policy must adequately recognise the numerous challenges, including cost considerations, in the incremental transition to a low carbon economy.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I concluded the two day session by stating that in relation to all the energy matters considered by the Ministers, our level of ambition must be underpinned by a rigorous analysis of the costs and benefits associated with the different possible approaches to new and existing policies, especially in exploiting new opportunities.  National energy circumstances are also important, as we strive to reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I will, during the remainder of our Presidency, be facilitating continued discussions at the Energy Working Party on identifying a robust 2030 framework which will facilitate long term European competitiveness and security of supply.

The target is set at 16% of all energy consumed to be from renewable sources.  Ireland has set out that we intend to meet the target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating by 2020, which together amounts to 16% of all energy consumed.  At the end of 2012, 6.4% of all energy consumed was from renewable sources, hence a significant increase is required in the period to 2020. <\/p><p>  Wave and tidal energy has the potential to contribute to our renewable electricity target by 2020, provided the technologies become commercially viable in the period to 2020.  Our National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) includes 75MW of ocean energy contributing to our 2020 target out of an estimated total of 4000MW required to deliver 40% renewable electricity.  This is based on the assumption that by 2020 some early pre-commercial wave and tidal devices will be connected and exporting power to the electricity grid. <\/p><p>  A range of supports have been deployed since 2009 in support of wave and tidal development.  The Ocean Energy Development Unit in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has been taking forward the development of the sector through administration of a Prototype Development Fund of grants for industry.  The purpose of the Prototype Development Fund is to fund research, development and deployment.  SEAI has also been progressing the development of a full scale grid connected wave test site off County Mayo, which would complement existing wave testing facilities i.e. the wave tank in Cork and the quarter scale wave testing site in Galway Bay.  It should also be noted that the cumulative amount of expenditure on Ocean Energy in the period 2009 &ndash; 2013, including the estimated 2013 allocation, is &euro;19.159m.<\/p><p>  Given the nature of research, development and deployment activity, especially in non-commercially viable areas such as wave and tidal energy, it is a reality that such activity is a high risk business for companies who engage in it.

Since 1 January 2013, the obligation rate stands at 6% by volume.<\/p><p>  The main types of biofuels being used in Ireland are ethanol which is blended with petrol and biodiesel which is blended with diesel.  Blends of up to 5% ethanol can be used in any petrol powered vehicle with blends of up to 7% biodiesel suitable for use in all diesel vehicles.<\/p><p>  How each Member State meets its 10% target is a matter for that Member State.  However, I understand that most Member States use quota systems similar to ours, though some define their obligation in energy terms rather than by volume and there is a wide range of obligation rates across Member States.  For example, Germany has a 6.5% by volume obligation and Portugal has a 5.5% obligation in energy terms.  The UK rate for 2013 and 2014 is 4.75% by volume.  Other countries also use gaseous biofuels such as biogas and biomethane in gas powered vehicles and the use of higher blend liquid fuels such as E85 is more commonplace in Europe than in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme has successfully delivered increased amounts of biofuel in Ireland resulting in 145 million litres being placed on the Irish market in 2011.  Of this, approximately 18.5 million litres was produced indigenously from waste material such as used cooking oil.  For the purpose of the Biofuel Obligation Scheme, a litre of biofuel produced from wastes and residues counts as two litres which means the use of such biofuel is incentivised under the scheme.

In a situation of mortgage repayment difficulty, one of the recommendations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt was that &ldquo;a standard financial statement (SFS) should be developed for use by all lenders and MABS, to assess a borrower&rsquo;s financial position and to identify a best course of action&rdquo; in respect of a borrower experiencing difficulty in meeting mortgage repayments.  A standard format for the SFS was developed by the IBF and MABS and approved by the Central Bank in 2011 and all lenders are required to use this SFS when dealing with consumers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) as set out in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.    The SFS is a key component to the effectiveness of the MARP as it requires borrowers to objectively assess their incomings and outgoings, assets and liabilities and it also provides the lender with valuable information regarding the financial position of the borrower in mortgage arrears or pre arrears and will allow the lender to make its assessment of a possible alternative repayment arrangement based on the full financial circumstances of the cooperating borrower.

However, in any such arrangement, the debtor will not be required to make payments at a level that would reduce his\/her income below that necessary to maintain a reasonable standard of living.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland has now published guidelines on what would constitute a reasonable standard of living for certain household types having regard to household composition and other relevant characteristics. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000055#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Implementation","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000055#WRC01250"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[19988\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000055#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there are any proposals to impose extra taxes or levies on briquettes or turf; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1040","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>Budget 2013 provided for the extension of carbon tax to all solid fuels supplied in the State.

The decision to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved.   I understand that insurance companies as a matter of course carry out reviews of the risks that they are prepared to insure against and sometimes make a decision to discontinue certain types of cover which they consider high risk such as homes close to a river which has previously flooded. These types of decisions are made sometimes on the basis of their broad past experience rather than looking at the individual circumstances of householders. <\/p><p>  In this regard it should be noted that the OPW has advised me that Bray and its environs has a history of flooding having flooded four times seriously in the last 100 years as well as two other significant events. The last serious flood occurred in August 1986 during &ldquo;Hurricane Charlie&rdquo; when over 500 properties were subjected to flooding. They have also indicated that in the severe event which hit the east coast in October 2011, it is understood that areas of Bray were close to evacuation when flood levels in the river began to fall.  These may be factors in the withdrawal of cover by insurance companies.<\/p><p>  OPW  has also advised me that following the Government&rsquo;s Capital expenditure review for flood relief activities the Bray Scheme was given the go-ahead and a contractor was appointed in February 2012 with works commencing in May 2012.

In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes. These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  <\/p><p>  As a result of maternity benefit payments becoming liable to income tax for all claimants, from 1 July 2013, a number of possible tax outcomes could arise:<\/p><p>  1. An individual may pay no income tax on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.<\/p><p>  2. An individual may pay income tax on some or all of their maternity benefit payment solely at the standard rate.<\/p><p>  3. An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment.<\/p><p>  4. An individual may pay income tax on all of their maternity benefit payment at the higher rate.<\/p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave. However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself. Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case, depends on the total level of income that the individual or couple concerned has in the relevant tax year or years.  <\/p><p>  I would point out that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI. <\/p><p>  Given the current budgetary constraints I have no plans to introduce a tax exemption along the lines proposed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000055#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000055#WRC03550"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[19807\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000055#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the revenue raised from an increase in capital acquisitions tax from 33% to 35%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1030","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from increasing the Capital Acquisitions Tax rate by 2% to 35<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>%, based on the expected outturn in 2013, could be in the region of &euro;18<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>million, assuming no change in the existing thresholds.

Under these repurchase agreements the 2025 Government Bonds were pledged as collateral by IBRC to Bank of Ireland (under the IBRC repo), and further by Bank of Ireland to the CBI (under the normal Eurosystem refinancing operations) in return for cash which was provided from the Eurosystem to Bank of Ireland and further from Bank of Ireland to IBRC (under the IBRC repo).  As a result, at the time of the IBRC liquidation, the CBI held the 2025 Irish Government Bonds as collateral on behalf of the Eurosystem and IBRC held the cash proceeds of the repurchase agreement between it and BOI.  The Bank of Ireland held neither bonds nor cash, but rather obligations for payment of cash and receipt of bonds with IBRC and offsetting obligations with the CBI.   The liquidation of IBRC constituted an event of default under the IBRC repo with BOI.  As a result, IBRC was obligated to repurchase the bonds from the Bank of Ireland at a repurchase price governed by the IBRC repo.  As IBRC was unable to repurchase these bonds from Bank of Ireland with cash, Bank of Ireland retained the 2025 Irish Government Bonds in fulfilment of IBRC&rsquo;s obligations under IBRC repo. In effect, the 2025 Irish Government Bonds, held as collateral by the Bank of Ireland under IBRC repo, were retained by Bank of Ireland in lieu of IBRC repurchasing these bonds with cash.  <\/p><p>  After the 2025 Government bond repo agreement between IBRC and Bank of Ireland terminated, the CBI purchased the bond.  This bond was placed in the trading portfolio of the Central Bank, along with the bonds acquired in exchange for the Promissory Notes, and these bonds will be sold as soon as possible, provided conditions of financial stability permit. <\/p><p>  To specifically respond to the points raised in your question, I am informed by the Bank of Ireland that, as a consequence of the termination of the IBRC repo and subsequent sale of the bonds to the CBI, the Bank of Ireland did not incur a gain or loss on these transactions. <\/p><p>  In addition, the funding provided to Bank of Ireland by the Eurosystem through the repo with CBI was further provided by Bank of Ireland to IBRC under the IBRC repo.  IBRC&rsquo;s non-payment of that funding back to Bank of Ireland upon default on the IBRC repo did not result in financing being retained by Bank of Ireland, as this financing had been passed to IBRC under the IBRC repo and was not repaid to Bank of Ireland upon the termination of the IBRC repo.<\/p><p>  Finally, the financing provided to Bank of Ireland by the Eurosystem under the repo through the CBI was provided under ordinary open market operations.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000056#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Debt Restructuring","counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000056#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[19873\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000056#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 252 of 19 February 2013, if he will provide further updates as to the aggregate of the principal of the National Assets Management Agency bonds that shall be issued in consideration for the net debt owed by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation to the Central Bank of Ireland; if he will explain the reason the National Assets Management Agency had not issued these securities during the week beginning 18 February 2013 as expected and detailed in his ministerial response; if he will confirm based on the way in which the Central Bank of Ireland manages its profits and given these NAMA bonds have euro system eligibility, the longer it takes for these NAMA bonds to be redeemed, the more profits the Central Bank of Ireland can make on the bonds on an annual basis and thus returned to the Irish Exchequer as long as the ECB open market rate remains lower than the interest on the NAMA bonds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":199,"content":"<p>I am advised that in order to complete the sale to NAMA by the Central Bank of Ireland (&ldquo;CBI&rdquo;) of the net debt owed by the Irish Bank resolution Corporation to the CBI (&ldquo;amount outstanding under the Facility Deed&rdquo;) a number of steps had to be completed which involved each of the three parties impacted by the transaction, the CBI, NAMA and the Special Liquidator.

For instance, as the Deputy will be aware, the BES was re-launched as the Employment and Investment Incentive, with changes to the amount of relief payable and types of companies that can qualify.<\/p><p><table><tr><th> Tax Relief Provision<\/th><th>Total 2009 <br \/>Cost    &euro;m<\/th><th>Saving if Standard<br \/>Rated       &euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Person Taking Care of Incapacitated Taxpayer <\/td><td>5.9<\/td><td>2.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Health Expenses (Nursing Homes) <\/td><td>23.1<\/td><td>6.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Contributions Under Permanent Health Benefit Schemes, after Deduction of Tax on Benefits Received<\/td><td>  3.9  <\/td><td>1.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Employees' Contributions To Approved Superannuation Schemes <\/td><td>729.0<\/td><td>345.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Retirement Annuity Premiums <\/td><td>237.2<\/td><td>105.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts <\/td><td>77.0<\/td><td>26.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Interest paid relating to borrowings for  purposes such as acquiring an interst in a company or partnership or to pay death duties<\/td><td>26.5 <\/td><td>11.6 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Expenses Allowable to Employees under Schedule E<\/td><td>73.7<\/td><td>27.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Retirement Relief for certain Sports Persons.<\/td><td>0.2<\/td><td>0.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Revenue Job Assist allowance<\/td><td>0.3<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Allowance for seafarers<\/td><td>0.2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Investment in Corporate Trades (BES) <\/td><td>25.6<\/td><td>13.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Investment in Seed Capital<\/td><td>2.9<\/td><td>1.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Stock Relief <\/td><td>2.0<\/td><td>0.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Relief for expenditure on significant buildings and gardens<\/td><td>4.6<\/td><td>2.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donation of Heritage items <\/td><td>0.7<\/td><td>0.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donation of Heritage  property to the Irish Heritage Trust<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donations to Approved Bodies (Income Tax only) <\/td><td>51.11<\/td><td>19.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donations to Sports Bodies (Income Tax only). <\/td><td>0.6<\/td><td>0.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Capital Allowances (Income Tax only)<\/td><td>1,004.9<\/td><td>395.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rented Residential Relief -Section 23 <\/td><td>46.9<\/td><td>24.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Investment in Films <\/td><td>42.0<\/td><td>25.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>2,358.3 <\/td><td>1,009.7 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRE04300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[20065\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRE04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the range of tax reliefs available to business here; and if he will set out the cost of these tax reliefs individually in 2012 or the last available full tax year.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":273,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[20069\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRE04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will list all current tax reliefs and their individual cost to the Exchequer in the last available tax year.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":274,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 187 together. <\/p><p><br \/>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total identifiable costs to the Exchequer which are currently available relate to income tax and corporation tax allowances, reliefs, exemptions and tax credits available as set out in the following tables for 2008 and 2009, the most recent year for which the necessary detailed historical information is available. Work is ongoing to update the costs to 2010 terms but this is not yet complete. Data is not yet available for 2011 as the tax returns for that year are currently being processed for statistical purposes . Tax returns from self-employed for 2012 are not due until the latter part of 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  It should be noted that there have been changes since this period, i.e. some schemes have been abolished or modified and others have been introduced. For instance, as the Deputy will be aware, virtually all of the area-based and property tax incentive schemes have ended and Finance Act 2012 provided for a cap on property-based Accelerated Capital Allowance Schemes (in line with the tax life of the particular scheme) to be introduced from 1 January 2015. Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.<\/p><p>Tax reliefs available exclusively for business reasons such as Stock Relief, Exempt Rental Income from Leasing of Farm Land, Capital Allowances,  Rate of 10% for Manufacturing and Certain Other Activities, Group Relief and Research &amp;amp; Development are <i>included in the tables.<\/i>    A number of tax reliefs, credits and deductions (for example, personal credits, pension contributions, BES, Film relief and property based tax incentives), which are included in the tables are also available to self-employed and PAYE taxpayers, but are not exclusively available for business reasons.<\/p><p><b>Index of Tables and Notes<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  a) Note on the Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009 <\/p><p>b) Table IT 6 showing Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009. Figures of cost in relation to corporation tax are included in the &#8220;<b>Income Tax and\/or Corporation Tax<\/b>  &#8221; section of this table.<\/p><p><br \/>  c) Notes on Table IT 6<\/p><p><br \/>  d) Note on Green Paper on Pensions<\/p><p><br \/>  e) Estimate of cost of certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax for 2008 and 2009.<\/p><p><br \/>  f) Note on reliefs in respect of which costs are not currently quantifiable or are negligible or are not identifiable within total aggregates.<\/p><p><b>a) Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The following table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system. A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax. An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.<\/p><p><br \/>  The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity. The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.<\/p><p><br \/>  In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the &#8220;costs&#8221; of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a &#8220;loss of tax revenue&#8221; on profits. To compute such &#8220;loss&#8221;, regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.<\/p><p><br \/>  The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.<\/p><p><br \/>  The figures of cost are for 2008 and 2009 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.<\/p><p><br \/>  The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).<\/p><p><br \/>  The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged. It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures. For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs. Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits. For instance, a person with &euro;1,000 gross trading profits, &euro;1,000 capital allowances and &euro;1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on &euro;1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn. In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on &euro;1,000. Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.<\/p><p><br \/>  The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.<\/p><p><br \/>  Apart from the artists exemption, these figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006, which took effect from 1 January 2007.

They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.<\/p><p>(3) The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.<\/p><p>(4) Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued. These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.<\/p><p>(5) Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a &ldquo;net pay&rdquo; basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.<\/p><p>(6) See the following note on &ldquo;Green Paper on Pensions&rdquo; for background commentary on the basis of the cost figures .<\/p><p>(7) &ldquo;Other&rdquo; relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership .<\/p><p>(8) The income on which the cost of exemption from income tax for charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. is based includes dividend income on which income tax deducted at source has been repaid, other investment income, payments received under covenant, donations by the PAYE sector to approved bodies together with the associated tax relief and donations by the self-employed and corporate sectors to approved bodies and approved sports bodies. Information is not available about other income received gross.<\/p><p>(9) The cost figures for relief for certain Sports Persons are based on income tax self assessment returns and for donations to Approved Sports Bodies are based on income tax and corporation tax self assessment returns.<\/p><p>(10) In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be more appropriate.<\/p><p>(11) The costs and numbers for the Exemption of Statutory Redundancy Payments are based on external data. From 2009 the &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; indicate the numbers of claims received in the year and not the numbers of claims approved.<\/p><p>(12) The costs included for corporation tax are by reference to accounting periods which ended in the years 2008 and 2009.<\/p><p>(13) The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with &ldquo;unused capital allowances&rdquo;, that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company&rsquo;s profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that &euro;3587 million and &euro;5373 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2008 and 2009 accounting periods respectively but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.<\/p><p>(14) The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of claims made in 2008 and 2009 tax returns for the first time. The cost shown is for income tax cases only.<\/p><p>(15) the cost shown for manufacturing relief for 2008 is compiled using the basic data available but for technical reasons associated with a system redesign it is understood to be understated by at least &euro;100m. Manufacturing Relief expired at the end of 2010.<\/p><p>(16) The costs shown for R&amp;amp;D is for claims for R&amp;amp;D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2008 and 2009. However, the cost for 2009 includes the amount of credit allowed against 2009 tax together with the amount offset against tax of previous accounting periods and as payable credits.<\/p><p><b>d) Note on Green Paper on Pensions - Review of estimates of cost<\/b><\/p><p>As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>The review drew on newly available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality. Estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision updated for 2008 and 2009 are included in table IT6.<\/p><p>The breakdown and make-up of these estimated costs of reliefs differ from presentations of costs in this area for years PRIOR TO 2005 in a number of respects and are not directly comparable. further details on the cost of tax and other reliefs and the changes in the methodology are contained in pages 106 and 107 of the Green Paper on Pensions.<\/p><p><b>e) Estimate of cost of certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax for 2008 and 2009<\/b><\/p><p>Certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax - uptake and estimated potential cost to the Exchequer in terms of income tax and corporation tax forgone based on 2008 and 2009 tax returns<\/p><p>Provisions were included in the Finance Acts of 2003 and 2004 to enable new statistical data on the uptake of tax relief for certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax to be obtained from tax returns.

Universal Social Charge (USC) is payable on an individual's pay and income after allowing for losses incurred in, or capital expenditure incurred for the purposes of a trade.  In relation to both PRSI and USC, pension contributions are not deducted in arriving at the amounts payable.  However, social welfare payments are not liable to either PRSI or USC.   In relation to extending PRSI and USC to other forms of income not already subject to the charge, the position is that, in Budget 2013, I announced that the Minister for Social Protection, Ms. Joan Burton, T.D., would be bringing forward legislation to change PRSI contributions as follows:<\/p><p>- Where modified PRSI rate payers have income from a trade or profession, such income and any unearned income they have will be made subject to PRSI with effect from the <i>1st of January 2013<\/i>; and<\/p><p>- Unearned income for everyone else will become subject to PRSI in <i>2014<\/i>.

A higher imputed distribution rate of 6% applies to ARFs and\/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs with asset values of more than &euro;2 million.  I assume the Deputy is suggesting an increase in the imputed distribution from 6% to 7% for ARFs and\/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs of more than &euro;2 million in value and an increase from 5% to 6% where the asset values are less than &euro;2 million.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information provided to them in the context of the tax paid on these deemed or imputed distributions does not include information on the value of the ARFs and\/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs out of which the distributions are deemed to arise.  There is therefore no basis on which a definitive estimate of the impact on the Exchequer of the change mentioned in the question could be compiled.<\/p><p>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the additional tax yield involved, some historical data made available to my Department from private sector sources provides a breakdown of ARFs by value in respect of a number of providers representing an estimated 40% of the ARF market.  There is no similar data available in relation to &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs.  Out of a total value of some &euro;2.4 billion in ARFs under management by these providers where the average ARF value was just over &euro;127,000, the total value of those ARFs representing individual funds under &euro;2 million was &euro;2.3 billion.  The total value of those ARFs representing individual funds of over &euro;2m was &euro;137 million.  Based on a very rough extrapolation of these figures to arrive at a broad potential estimate for the total value of ARFs with assets in these value ranges, the estimated additional income tax yield from applying increased imputed distribution rates to such ARFs as set out above would be about &euro;25 million in a full year.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the deemed or imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage draw downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement in the same way as a retirement annuity, for which ARFs are supposed to operate as a more flexible alternative.  The measure, in itself, does not give rise to significant tax revenues as it does not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs, which are taxed in the normal way.  Moreover, increasing the annual percentage notional distribution for ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs as suggested in the question would further increase the risk that the retirement income derived by the owners from such funds could be depleted before death.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[20071\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount that could be raised for the Exchequer by reducing the earnings cap for pension contributions to &euro;70,000.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the current annual earnings cap of &euro;115,000 which operates to limit the level of tax-relieved personal pension contributions in any one year.

These are Section 598 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (which in the main is aimed at individuals who dispose of their business or farming assets outside of the family) and Section 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (which is aimed at individuals who transfer their business or farming assets to their children).<\/p><p><br \/>  Both reliefs are aimed at smaller businesses and have been a feature of the capital gains tax system since its enactment in 1975. In the Finance Act of 2012 the terms of the relief were modified as follows:<blockquote>Under Section 598, full relief from capital gains tax is granted to an individual aged 55 or over but less than 66 years who disposes of a business or farm where the consideration does not exceed &euro;750,000.  Where the consideration exceeds &euro;750,000, any capital gains tax that may be payable is limited so that it cannot exceed 50% of the difference between the amount of the consideration and &euro;750,000.<br \/><br \/><br \/>  With effect from 1 January 2014, where an individual aged 66 or over disposes of a business or farm, the threshold by reference to which relief is granted is reduced to &euro;500,000, again with a limit on any capital gains tax payable, where the consideration exceeds &euro;500,000, so that it cannot exceed 50% of the difference between the amount of the consideration and &euro;500,000.<br \/><br \/><br \/>  As an interim measure, to facilitate any individual who wants to avail of the relief before the age and threshold changes take effect, an individual aged 66 or over who disposes of a business or farm in the year to 31 December 2013 will qualify for full relief by reference to the &euro;750,000 limit.<\/blockquote>  Under Section 599, which provides for relief for an individual who passes on his business or farm to his or her child, the relief operates on a similar basis to Section 598, except that the consideration limit is &euro;3 million (introduced in Finance Act 2012) and there is no marginal relief.  Therefore, any farmer aged 55 or over who passes on a farm to a child of his or hers which has a value of up to &euro;3 million will be entitled to full relief from capital gains tax.<\/p><p><br \/>  As I mentioned in my Budget Speech of 2012, the intention of modifying the retirement relief from Capital Gains Tax is to better incentivise the timely transfers of farms and businesses before the current owners reach the age of 66. This approach is in keeping with the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine of encouraging timely transfer of farm assets and improving the age profile of farming. Both the Commission on Taxation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine made recommendations regarding the capping of the Section 599 relief at &euro;3 million and these recommendations were considered in the context of the amendments made to the reliefs.  The intention of the more favourable reliefs for individuals who dispose of their businesses or farms between the ages of 55 and 66, relative to those who do so from 66 onwards is to encourage the passing on of those businesses or farms to a younger generation, thereby encouraging entrepreneurship and the increased productive use of business assets and farms.<\/p><p><br \/>  In your question you state that an 85 year old person could incur a capital gains tax liability of &euro;125,000. Based on the current rate of capital gains tax, this would mean that the person would have made a chargeable gain of in the region of &euro;380,000 and where the business or farm was sold, would have realised a significant consideration on the disposal.  In such circumstances, a contribution in the form of capital gains tax is considered appropriate. In the case of a farmer transferring his or her farm to a child, the threshold of &euro;3 million is considered to be sufficiently high to ensure that in all but the exceptionally large farms this threshold will ensure that no capital gains tax charge will arise.  If a capital gains tax charge should arise on the exceptionally large farms, it is considered appropriate that capital gains tax should be paid on any gain arising.  The changes to these reliefs will apply to disposals arising on or after 1 January 2014.  Accordingly, it is too soon to comment definitively on their impact at this stage.  However, the reliefs will be kept under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRF02150"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[20161\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will clarify the position on local property tax liability for adjoining living quarters of rate paying businesses that have no saleable value; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>Based on the information supplied by the Deputy it is not possible to give a definitive reply, however, by way of general information, the following may be of relevance in this case.

However, it is not chargeable on the part of a building in respect of which commercial rates are payable.

Finance Act 2013 was passed into law on 27th March and section 17 of the Act, which makes provision for the pre-retirement access to AVCs announced in the Budget, has effect from that date. Section 17 introduces a new section 782A into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides members of occupational pension schemes with a three-year window of opportunity to draw down, on a once-off basis, up to 30% of the accumulated value of certain AVCs made by them, including additional voluntary PRSA contributions made to AVC PRSAs. Where AVCs are subject to a pension adjustment order, both parties to the order may exercise the option independently in respect of their respective \"share\" of the AVCs.<\/p><p>  The procedures set out in the legislation for exercising the AVC access option are straight forward and I have outlined these hereunder. However, in addition to these procedures, I am aware from discussions which my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have had with various pension industry representative bodies, that the administrators of AVC funds will also be putting administrative procedures and systems in place to facilitate the access option at an operational level. I understand that these administrative and systems procedures are in the process of being finalised.<\/p><p>  The likelihood is, of course, that an individual contemplating availing of the option will firstly contact his pension fund administrator by phone or email to establish what he or she needs to do. In that regard, the legislation requires the individual to give an irrevocable written instruction to the administrator of the fund that he or she wishes to avail of the option. Provided the individual qualifies for the encashment option, the administrator acts on the instruction by determining the value of the AVC fund and paying an amount, not exceeding 30% of the value, to the individual subject to deduction of the appropriate amount of tax. The amount paid is treated as emoluments to which Schedule E applies and tax is collected at source under the PAYE system. The legislation requires the administrator to deduct tax at the higher rate of 41%, unless the administrator has received from Revenue a tax credit certificate in respect of the individual. The payments are specifically exempt from USC and PRSI.<\/p><p>   I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in advance of any payment of AVCs being made, the individual exercising the option should contact his or her Revenue Office for a Certificate of Tax Credits and Standard Rate Cut-off point in respect of the AVC payment. It may be the case that the pension fund administrator will contact Revenue on behalf of the individual, but where the individual is applying directly to Revenue he or she would need to advise Revenue of the pension fund administrator's registered number (i.e. employer number) so that Revenue can forward the Certificate to the correct administrator. The Certificate will indicate the Standard Rate Cut-off Point and tax credits, if any, appropriate to the AVC access payment and facilitate the deduction of the correct amount of tax by the administrator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates Issues","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":343,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[20368\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views regarding an increase in interest charges for homeowners who have variable mortgages with AIB, EBS and Haven; the effect that these increases will have on customers who are struggling to meet their mortgage repayments every month; if he will take steps to consult with the banks and building societies regarding this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":344,"content":"<p>While the Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing in the current environment, ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial matter for the management and the Board of the Institution.

This framework is published on the Department of Finance website. I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.

While this decision by AIB is regrettable it is strictly a commercial decision by the board of AIB and I understand that this increase now brings AIB in line with the market average. The standard variable rates charged by the Irish banks are significantly below the equivalent rates by banks in the rest of the euro area, even though many of these banks have far lower funding costs.<\/p><p>  It must be remembered that in order to fund mortgages the bank must borrow at current wholesale and deposit rates which are currently higher than the ECB base rate and the bank must ensure that the rate it lends at is economically sustainable and provides a return for the bank and ultimately the State as its shareholder.

While there are no specific exemptions or financial concessions from LPT for householders in flood prone areas, the following information would be of relevance in these cases.  As LPT is a self-assessed tax, it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  For the purposes of LPT, properties valued under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands - an initial band from &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 and between &euro;100,001 and &euro;1 million a range of &euro;50,000 in each band - and property owners will not be required to provide a precise value for their property.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Revenue Commissioners have prepared valuation guidance which, together with the owner's own knowledge of her\/his property, will assist in assessing its value.

In this context, location and the risk of flooding are factors which are likely to impact on the market value of a property and which a property owner would generally take into account in valuing the property.

The Review recognised that \"many internationally orientated Irish companies preferred option is to raise capital overseas\". These companies may be able to exploit the funding opportunities offered by the JOBS Act.  The Government has taken a number of significant initiatives aimed at providing equity support for SMEs. The NPRF has announced two funds which will invest in SMEs. The SME Equity Fund (total fund size &euro;300 million - &euro;350 million \/ NPRF commitment &euro;125 million) will focus on investing in healthy businesses seeking to grow, including those with overleveraged balance sheets. The fund, which has received commitments from other-third party investors, is operational and is managed by Carlyle Cardinal Ireland.<\/p><p>  The SME Turnaround Fund (total effective fund size &euro;100 million \/ NPRF commitment &euro;50 million) will invest in underperforming businesses which are at or close to the point of insolvency but have the potential for financial and operational restructuring. Typically 40 per cent of the capital invested by the fund will be used to buy the business and 60 per cent will be used to finance the turnaround in order to place it on a sustainable long-term footing. The fund is also operational and is managed by Better Capital.<\/p><p>  In addition, the NPRF is also currently reviewing additional SME fund opportunities that would complement these funds, with the objective that the eventual suite of funds would have the capacity to invest across the full spectrum of SME financing needs.<\/p><p>  The 10 point Tax reform plan to help small business announced in the 2013 budget is another initiative which is aimed at assisting SMEs gain access to funding. These measures complement measures already being undertaken by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and bodies under its aegis. In particular, Innovation Fund Ireland and Development Capital Fund Ireland provide equity for SMEs.<\/p><p>  The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme addresses the situation where the SME is outside the risk appetite of the banks. This can arise because the SME's lack of collateral or the banks' lack of understanding of the business model, the market, the sector or the technology. The three main SME lenders are all participating in the Guarantee scheme.<\/p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme will provide loans of up to &euro;25k to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, who have commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.<\/p><p>  The SME State Bodies Group was established in 2012 to both develop key policy initiatives to support SME access to credit and other forms of finance, and to ensure their implementation. It will continue in 2013 to engage intensively in proactively addressing issues associated with SME funding and financing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders through the SME Funding Consultation Committee. My officials also meet frequently with additional stakeholders who wish to contribute to policy development in relation to access to finance.<\/p><p>  One of the actions assigned to the State Bodies Group under the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is to \"Investigate the potential for alternative funding mechanisms including peer to peer lending, supply chain finance and crowdfunding.\"<\/p><p>  A matrix on SME funding has been completed and published on Department of Finance website and smallbusinessfinance.ie website. This matrix outlines various sources of funding available to SME and provides contact information for them.<\/p><p>  Crowd funding is in its infancy in Ireland. I am aware of a peer to peer credit website which was recently launched in Ireland. Irish entities, particularly in the creative fields, have accessed other crowd funding sites. However, the issue of crowdsourcing equity and securities regulations is not an issue which has been raised with my Department.

This advice will be included in the NCSE's comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs which is currently in preparation and which is expected in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRG04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[19782\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRG04700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to remove funding for pupils with autism in mainstream school for their July provision.","asker":"1017","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":373,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that there no plans to remove funding for pupils with autism in mainstream schools for their July provision.

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for. Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability\/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability.

The report from this study is currently being finalised.  It is expected that it will be completed late in 2013 for publication in 2014.  The study has been carried out by researchers at the University of Northampton, UK; Trinity College, Dublin; and the Irish based, Institute of Child Education and Psychology Europe.<\/p><p>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has requested the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to provide policy advice to my Department, in accordance with its role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, on the appropriate nature and configuration of educational supports which should be provided to schools to support children with special educational needs. It is intended that the significant resources to support children with Special Educational Needs are deployed to ensure the best possible outcomes for students. The advice will be a key input into achieving this goal. The advice from the National Council for Special Education is expected in the coming months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRJ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vocational Education Committees Staff","counter":462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRJ02550"},{"type":"question","counter":463,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[20321\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRJ02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding vocational education committee employees who are also members of local authorities being allowed to absent themselves from work in order to attend council meetings; the number of VEC employees that are members of local authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":464,"content":"<p>Teachers employed by Vocational Education Committees (VECs) who are also members of Public Bodies (i.e local authorities) are allowed up to a maximum of 10 days off each year to attend meetings of such bodies during school hours.

Public procurement in Ireland is governed by legal requirements, rules and guidelines set both at national and EU level. The general requirements for goods and general services are set out in the Public Procurement Guidelines - Competitive Process 2004 (revised), whilst those for works and works-related contracts are set out in the Capital Works Management Framework. This guidance incorporates key elements of EU legislation that have been transposed into Irish law and is complemented by circulars and guidance issued by my Department and the National Procurement Service.<\/p><p><br \/>  The most important of the guidance published by my Department includes:<\/p><p><i>- Public Procurement Guidelines - Competitive Process 2004<\/i>  , in respect of the procurement of services and supplies - highlighting the need for a competitive process in respect of contracts below the EU threshold values;<\/p><p><i>- Circular 10\/10<\/i>   - require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts;<\/p><p><i>- the Capital Works Management Framework<\/i>   - provides a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents are available to download for all contracting authorities to provide a consistent approach to the management of public works projects; and<\/p><p><i>- Standardisation and simplification of tender documentation (for supplies and services)<\/i>   - In order to reduce the costs involved in participating or conducting the procurement function, the National Procurement Service has published a suite of model tendering and contract documents which help businesses and buyers to reduce costs. <\/p><p>All regulations, circulars, guidelines and standard forms are available on the Government's eTenders website at: <i><i>www.eTenders.gov.ie <\/i><\/i>for goods and general services and at <i><i>www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie   <\/i><\/i>for construction works and related services.<\/p><p>Under EU Directive on public procurement contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria. For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;130,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;200,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;400,000. For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website <i><i>www.etenders.gov.ie  <\/i><\/i> or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers.<\/p><p><br \/>  The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department is currently participating at EU level in the review of EU Directives: 2004\/17\/EC (procurement in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors) and 2004\/18\/EC (public works, supply and service contracts). Whilst discussions on the revision of these Directives are currently underway, it is clear that one of the key reforms will be the introduction of an EU wide eProcurement procedure which will facilitate shorter procurement procedures.<\/p><p><br \/>  The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.  In relation to delays being experienced by some local authorities in public procurement processes, these are matters for my colleague Deputy Phil Hogan, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Referendum Expenditure","counter":479,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":480,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[20172\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the total costs incurred from the Central Fund in holding the Referendum on Children&rsquo;s Rights in 2012; the breakdown of those costs including the cost of establishing a Referendum Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":481,"content":"<p>The Referendum on the Protection of Children was held on the 10th November, 2012.

The Valuation Office operates within the employment control framework set by Government for the public service which imposes an overall staffing ceiling for the Office on an annual basis. In line with this policy, the current staffing complement of the Valuation Office is 135, representing 132.40 whole time equivalent posts. The appointment of officers to carry out the valuation of properties is the function of the Commissioner which he exercises under his powers of delegation set out in section 11 of the Act.  There are two provisions in the legislation governing the assessment of valuations, i.e. revision and revaluation.<\/p><p>  Revision of valuation is the mechanism used to maintain existing local authority valuation lists. It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. The valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined by reference to the net annual values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. That is to say that they are compared with similar type properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated equally. While there are some arrears of casework in this area, it is not significant and in any event, revision applications received from the public are disposed of without undue delay. While there has been a marked decrease in the number of applications for revision of valuation in recent years, mainly due to the economic downturn, the vast majority of applications are from the local authorities with whom the Valuation Office is in close liaison, to ensure that priority cases are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and to agree timelines for the delivery of revisions generally.<\/p><p>  In a revaluation the entire commercial valuation list for a local authority is brought up-to-date by reference to values at a specific valuation date and the entire list is published on one date (usually 31 December) and comes into effect for rating purposes on 1 January the following year.  To-date, revaluations of the commercial list have been completed in South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire County Council areas and the revaluation programme for the Dublin City Council area is currently underway and is expected to be completed by 31st December, 2013. Additionally, the revaluation of properties in all the local authority areas of Waterford and Limerick will be completed in 2013 and 2014 respectively.<\/p><p>  The Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2012 which had its second stage reading in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11th October, 2012 provides for a number of initiatives  to accelerate the overall revaluation programme, such as the piloting of a self-assessment scheme of valuation in one local authority area, which if it proves successful could be extended to other areas. There is also provision in the Bill to allow for the assessment of valuations by contract valuers under an external delivery scheme which is also being initiated as a pilot project. The Bill also contains provisions to streamline the overall process of revaluation and the appeal mechanisms available to ratepayers subsequent to the revaluation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":491,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRK00950"},{"type":"question","counter":492,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[19894\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount the State spent on lighting in State owned or operated public buildings in 2012.","asker":"1048","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":493,"content":"<p>Lighting is not metered separately in the vast majority of public buildings.

In advance of ratification, significant preparatory work is necessary which is expected to take up to eighteen months to complete.  This work includes setting the Rules of Procedure of the Court, selection and training of Judges, setting up an ICT system to provide for case management at the Court etc.  <\/p><p>  The UPC will not impact on substantive patent law in Ireland or on the operation of the Courts in Ireland which will continue to play a role in the determination of patent- related disputes that come before the Irish Courts.<\/p><p>  When operational, the UPC will provide a system of arbitration for patent-related disputes.  This will be in relation to European patents that are granted as at present by the European Patent Office in Munich and, patents that will be granted under the new unitary patent regime.  The unitary patent will provide a new option for Irish business to protect their patents in a cost effective manner by filing a single application and thereby obtain patent protection in the territories of the 25 participating States (with the exception, thus far, of Spain and Italy).   The unitary patent and the UPC are interlinked in that both will enter into effect simultaneously.  <\/p><p>  The Agreement on the UPC provides that it will comprise of a Court of First Instance and a Court of Appeal.  The Court of First Instance will be made up of three divisions namely: the central division, local divisions and possible regional divisions.  The Court of Appeal is to be located in Luxembourg and will also serve as the Court Registry.<\/p><p>  1) Central division: The Central Division of the Patent Court will be located in Paris.

Some countries use gestational age only, while others use weight, or a combination of both. The preferred criterion of the World Health Organisation is weight, as it is more objectively determined than gestational age. At the time, it was considered that the definition of a stillbirth should be as wide as possible, consistent with accepted medical norms, and it is on this basis that the criteria described above were decided upon.<\/p><p>  It is very distressing for families trying to deal with tragic circumstances such as these.

It is important to remember that control savings are not actual monies recovered by the Department but are a good indication of the increase in social welfare expenditure that would occur without these activities taking place.  Without this control work, social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount.  These activities also have a deterrent or knock-on effect, which are not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.<\/p><p>  Controls are exercised at both the initial claim stage and at subsequent stages during the claim life cycle. Claims are reviewed on a regular and targeted basis. Means-tested payments are reviewed at certain intervals or when there are indications that changes in circumstances have not been reported to the Department. Those in receipt of illness payments are called for a medical examination by the Department's medical assessors.  Customers in receipt of unemployment payments are checked on a regular basis to verify continued compliance with such requirements as being available for and genuinely seeking employment.<\/p><p>  Current measures to control fraud and abuse also include desk reviews of claim papers, home visits, the issue of mail-shots to selected customers, database checking and data matching with other organisations.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit focuses on planned and systematic control activity and projects.

The government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the gradual implementation of a guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided. <\/font>    Other relevant provision is made through the training and education programmes delivered through F&Aacute;S and the further education sector.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The size and the timescale for any additional provision that is both desirable and feasible, over and above that outlined above, will be established over the coming months.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">In this context, the Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a youth guarantee in Ireland. We have sought funding from the European Commission for a proposed pilot Youth Guarantee Scheme (YGS) in the Ballymun area of north Dublin, and numerous organisations (e.g. IBEC, Ballymun Job Centre, National Youth Council of Ireland) have agreed to participate in this pilot. We are currently waiting to hear from the European Commission as to whether or not our application has been successful. We have been informed that a final decision on our application will be made by the end of June.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Subject to approval from the Commission, the proposed Ballymun YGS pilot will look to develop an activation approach tailored to the needs of young people.  It is intended that the Ballymun pilot YGS will, in respect of the target group of young people, guarantee access to career guidance\/assistance leading to identification of an individual career plan for the young unemployed person with follow-through to training, education, work experience or full-time employment.  Depending on the needs of the young individual the steps in the career plan might include personal assessment, job search assistance, skills training, work experience internships, but the objective in all cases will be to lead the young person to employment placement or further education or training. A particular focus of the pilot YGS will be to involve, and build links with, employers in the locality and the immediate hinterland in order to ensure that the guidance and training elements of the YGS are tailored to the needs of the local labour market and also to generate work placement\/experience opportunities for the YGS participants.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRO01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":668,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRO01250"},{"type":"question","counter":669,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[20248\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRO01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the average waiting time, in the past twelve months for a review, in line with the relevant social welfare legislation, to be carried out by the Chief Appeals Officer, of appeals already decided by appeals officers.","asker":"1015","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":670,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the information sought by the Deputy is not available.<\/p><p>  Processing times in relation to appeals are measured and reported by an ICT system in the Appeals Office.

This was in keeping with the recommendations of Justice Quirke following the Peatlands Forum and with the motion agreed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 7th   of March.<\/p><p>  My Department has now engaged a team of specialists who are undertaking the necessary scientific work to underpin the National Plan and to inform the future restoration and management of each of the SACs. This work is being overseen by an independent steering group with input from the Peatlands Council. Draft proposals for each of the sites will be discussed with affected parties as part of this process. <\/p><p>  The detailed exploration of relocation sites is a key element in progressing the National Plan. In collaboration with the Peatlands Council, and with the assistance of Bord na M&oacute;na, my Department is actively engaging with turf cutting communities to consider how relocation can be progressed. <\/p><p>  The aim of my Department is to facilitate, as far as possible, those qualifying cutters who wish to continue to cut turf by putting in place relocation sites for as many cutters as possible in the shortest possible time. Given the complexities of the process it can take time to resolve all issues to finality even as new sites come on stream. The provision of financial payments or deliveries of turf is available to those awaiting relocation. My officials will continue to work with local groups on these issues within the principles of the relocation scheme.<\/p><p>  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made for groups from Clara Bog in County Offaly and from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog in County Galway. <\/p><p>  My Department also envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during this turf cutting season provided that final agreement is reached with relevant cutters.<\/p><p>  Of the remaining 49 raised bog SACs, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation.<\/p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na undertook a preliminary assessment of a potential relocation site for turf cutters on Coolrain Bog Special Area of Conservation on behalf of my Department. On the basis of this assessment, Bord na M&oacute;na has undertaken a stratigraphy assessment of this site in order to get a better indication of the quality and quantity of peat there. The stratigraphy report has recently been received by my Department. Officials from my Department will contact turf cutter representatives from Coolrain Bog shortly with a view to discussing the report and other relevant issues. <\/p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants from Coolrain Bog while awaiting relocation to a non-designated bog. <\/p><p>  The continuation of cutting on parts of any raised bog SAC,  such as Coolrain, may only be considered within the strict parameters of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive, which prescribe the circumstances under which potentially damaging activities can be consented to. In the context of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, it may be possible to bring some flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, that could allow limited cutting within a small number of sites, if there are no alternatives. <\/p><p>  I am determined that, in collaboration with the Peatlands Council and local turf-cutting communities, substantial progress will be made on the plan over the coming months. My Department has stepped up contact with turf-cutting groups to seek long-term solutions to the issues for their particular bogs, in compliance with EU and national law. I hope that the Plan can be completed by November, in time to submit an application to the European Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, if required, prior to the 2014 cutting season. <\/p><p>  However, the engagement and agreement of turf-cutting communities to its proposed approaches will be essential to meeting this timeline, and to unlocking the potential flexibility it offers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRP04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation Appeals","counter":750,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRQ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":751,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[20381\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRQ00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when an SAC appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) will take place; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":752,"content":"<p>I understand that the appellant in question is one of a number for this site who have already opted for a Stage 2 formal hearing of their case before the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board.

The last Budget specifically contained a ten point tax reform plan to support small businesses. The measures contained in the Budget are intended to assist small businesses in a number of ways, including:helping their cash flow position; helping them access funding more easily; reducing the costs associated with the administrative burden of tax compliance; boosting demand for their products in new markets abroad; incentivising firms to create jobs.<\/p><p>  As regards labour costs for small and medium enterprises, the economy has in recent years achieved very significant improvements. The European Commission, in its most recent forecast, projected that Irish unit labour costs will improve by 23 per cent relative to the euro area average over the period 2009 to 2014.  <\/p><p>  In this regard, I have been engaged in a continuous process of reform to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers. Last year, I reduced the overall number of Joint Labour Committees (JLCs). I asked the Labour Court to undertake a review of remaining JLC's in line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act which I introduced last year. Last week, the Labour Court submitted to me its Review on the Reform of the remaining JLC's. I view this report very much within the context of the continuous process of reform in the area that is designed to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers. Specifically, the Report suggests a template on how many Committees will continue in existence, and the format within which they will operate over the next five years. <\/p><p>  The Government is determined to maintain a focus on competitiveness and, to that end, Forf&aacute;s, in conjunction with my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection has been tasked under the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to assess the potential for further actions to support improvements in labour market competitiveness.<\/p><p>  Finally, my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, recently announced details of a new initiative, the JobsPlus scheme, which will incentivise businesses to hire additional employees from the Live Register.

There is potential for maximising synergies while addressing the possible trade-offs between competitiveness, security of supply and sustainability.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Commissioner Oettinger attended the Informal Meeting. He highlighted how any new framework should take into account current economic difficulties whilst remaining ambitious on the long-term low carbon objective.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The Council of Energy Ministers also discussed the effects of unconventional oil and gas on energy supply, competitiveness and prices.  In relation to the work currently underway by the European Commission on unconventional hydrocarbon extraction, the Irish Presidency requested that the Commission would reflect on the debate among Ministers in Dublin, particularly on the global competitiveness and security of supply aspects, and to take those views into consideration in their work on the matter, having regard to legitimate environmental and safety considerations.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The two days of discussions were informed by the goal of full implementation of the internal energy market.  Ministers agreed that this is not an end in itself, but rather, it must bring tangible benefits to all energy consumers.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">On the issue of the links between smart technology, innovation and energy policy, I concluded that the ultimate objective in rolling out standardised smart meters and smart grids across Europe must be value and benefit driven, with a specific consumer focus. In so doing, we must recognise the energy needs, circumstances and IT capabilities of all categories of consumers.  Data protection concerns should also be considered and addressed.  The need for public awareness campaigns on the potential advantages was acknowledged and the benefits must be clear to all individual energy customers and management of energy consumption.  Product and price analysis must be simple and straightforward.  Suppliers will also have a responsibility to build consumer trust given the huge volume on data in question.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The financing of energy efficiency measures was also discussed. Realising the energy efficiency potential of buildings is central to the EU's energy efficiency policy.  Nearly 40% of final energy is consumed in homes, offices and shops.  The challenge that faces Energy Ministers is to find the necessary finance to underpin the energy retrofit renovation that is required as part of our 2020 energy and climate goals.  This is particularly important given the potential for jobs and growth that a sustained campaign of energy efficiency in buildings would realise.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">At a thought provoking final session which considered the integration of variable renewable energy sources, in particular wind and solar energy, the Ministers agreed that the proper development of energy policy must adequately recognise the numerous challenges, including cost considerations, in the incremental transition to a low carbon economy.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I concluded the two day session by stating that in relation to all the energy matters considered by the Ministers, our level of ambition must be underpinned by a rigorous analysis of the costs and benefits associated with the different possible approaches to new and existing policies, especially in exploiting new opportunities.  National energy circumstances are also important, as we strive to reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I look forward to continuing discussions on identifying a robust 2030 framework which will facilitate long term European competitiveness and security of supply.

The number of licences available for draft net operations is set out in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order currently S.I. 75 of 2013.  This Order authorises the issue of commercial fishing licences by Inland Fisheries Ireland and sets out the criteria under which those licences may be issued and prescribes the maximum number of commercial licences that may be issued.<\/p><p>The mechanism for controlling the take of salmon by the commercial fishery is not by licence number but by quota.  Each year commercial fishermen apply for commercial licences and are assessed against criteria as set out in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order which gives priority to established fishermen with a recent history of fishing in the fishery.  All applications are put before the Board of Inland Fisheries Ireland for approval.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the Total Allowable Catch (quota set) determines the number of fish that can be harvested regardless of the number of licences in operation.  The Total Allowable Catch is the surplus available above the conservation limit for the river that can be harvested.  This allows for the sustainable exploitation of the river whilst conserving the required number of spawning fish for the system.<\/p><p>The surplus available for 2013 for the River Feale is 1,992 fish.  This quota is divided between the commercial fishermen and recreational anglers by the River Basin District Director following consultation with the Fisheries District Committee.  The quota is identified by the National Standing Committee for Salmon following assessment of all the relevant scientific data for the river in question including catch figures for the previous 5 years and any other relevant data.

International comparisons do not take account of high speed services at speeds up to and exceeding 1 gigabit per second which are contracted by heavy users of such service for use using leased lines or comparable links.  Furthermore, International comparison tables are based on marketed services which do not take account of actual accessibility to those speeds within any state nor do they take account of the actual customer experience which may differ from state to state.<\/p><p>  In Ireland high capacity broadband links over leased lines, which are capable of meeting the needs of heavy users including hospitals, schools, local authorities and third level educational institutions, are widely available.  However, as mentioned above, these services are not included in international comparisons.  In the case of post primary schools the Government has announced plans to equip all post primary schools with 100Mbps broadband.  This programme is continuing and all schools will be connected by the start of the 2014 academic year <\/p><p>  In the case of marketed broadband services, data reports published by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), reveal that the number of broadband subscribers has more than doubled in Ireland to over 1.6 million between 2007 and 2012.  Similarly, in the case of speeds, the number of residential customers contracted in a range between 2&ndash;10 megabits per second (Mbps) increased from 41% of all subscribers in 2007 to 71% in 2012.  The number of subscribers accessing speeds exceeding 10 Mbps increased from 0.2% to 24% in the same period.  95% of customers are therefore contracted at speeds of 2 Mbps or more compared to an EU average availability at 2 Mbps or more over fixed lines of 92%.<\/p><p>  In the case of comparing the fastest marketed speeds, the most recently published OECD data ranks Ireland 16th   fastest of more than 30 countries surveyed for fastest advertised retail broadband speed.<\/p><p>  Subject to the cautions expressed above about interpreting international comparison tables, it can be concluded that there has been significant growth in the take up of marketed retail broadband services and contracted speeds in Ireland in recent years and, in addition, high bandwidth is widely available in Ireland over leased lines.  The take up of basic broadband in Ireland at speeds of 2 Mbps or more compares favourably with similar accessibility as an EU average.  The availability of high speed services is also increasing rapidly with UPC now offering speeds of 150Mbps to almost 700,000 homes and Eircom preparing to launch new next generation fixed line services.  Mobile operators are also preparing to launch high speed 4G services following ComReg&rsquo;s successful conclusion of the multi band spectrum auction.  The Government has committed to ensuring that broadband speeds of at least 30Mbps are available in all parts of Ireland.  This will require intervention by the State in areas where there is no case for investment by the commercial market.

It is a matter for each local authority to decide upon the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean up actions in relation to both litter and illegal dumping, taking account of local circumstances and priorities.  My Department also provides funding to local authorities to support their efforts in this area.   <\/p><p>  While I currently have no plans to launch a national litter and illegal dumping awareness campaign on television and national radio, I have recently allocated &euro;900,000 to local authorities from Environment Fund under the 2013 Anti-Litter &amp;amp; Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grants Scheme.  My Department has co-funded these grants for local authority anti-litter awareness and education initiatives since 1997.  Under this scheme, local authorities are responsible for selecting suitable projects for funding and deciding on individual grant allocations.  The scheme requires that projects selected should promote greater public awareness and education in relation to both litter and graffiti.  They should also, where possible, focus on voluntary initiatives by community and environmental groups and involve schools and young people in anti-litter and anti-graffiti action.  Typically, eligible projects include local media campaigns, clean-ups, primary\/secondary school competitions, exhibitions and the production of videos, posters and leaflets.  The maximum grant for a project may be up to 70% of the cost, with the balance being met by local contributions. <\/p><p>  My Department has also taken several steps to combat the problem of small scale illegal dumping in recent times.  In summer 2012, I launched a national campaign in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency and supported by the print media, to highlight the economic value of our environment and encouraging the public to report all incidences of illegal dumping to the Agency's National Environmental Complaints hotline at 1850 365 121.

There are currently 35 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA, providing accommodation and ancillary services to 4,715 persons.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Direct Provision system remains a key pillar of the State's asylum and immigration system and I have no plans to end it.  I, and previous Ministers for Justice and Equality, have explained in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the normal structures dealing with homelessness could not cope when the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland increased dramatically, and how the Direct Provision system was the only realistic accommodation solution.  There are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.  In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. This was a key finding in the recent Value for Money Report on the direct provision system which was published in 2010 and is on the RIA website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie.<\/i>   I have also explained the nature of the full board accommodation system provided; how RIA coordinates through other Government bodies a number of ancillary services to residents; how residents are offered free medical screening on arrival in the State and have access to health services; and how residents have access to primary and secondary education services, on the same basis as Irish citizens.<\/p><p><br \/>  The practical effect of limiting the time spent by children spent in Direct Provision to six months is that the system itself becomes largely inoperable beyond that period for all residents. The alternative is the granting of the right to work and an extensive range of mainstreamed social and housing supports which, for the reasons given above, is not a realistic policy option.  That said, I have acknowledged that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process is an issue to be addressed.  The accommodation system is inextricably linked to the surrounding asylum process. The revised Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications. This work is being given high priority and applicants will be advised of the new arrangements as soon as possible. <\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the psychological needs of asylum seekers in direct provision, including their children, all such persons are entitled to the same level of medical - including psychological - care as persons residing in the general community. Asylum seekers are, by definition, a category of persons who arrived in this country seeking protection from harm.  They are disconnected from their home country, from family and from their social network. Decisions as to whether there needs to be specific research into the psychological needs of a particular set of children is ultimately a matter for the HSE to determine. In this context, it should be noted that the medical and psychological services provided to asylum seekers are at least on a par with those provided to the community generally. Some additional supports such as psychological supports focussed specifically on asylum seekers are also provided. Other organisations also provide supports locally and nationally, many of which (such as Spirasi's Centre for the Survivors of Torture) receive funding from the HSE.<\/p><p><br \/>  In this connection, it cannot be emphasised enough that RIA takes the issue of child welfare, and the protection of residents generally, very seriously. RIA has had a child protection policy, based on the HSE's Children First Policy, in place since 2006. There is a specific unit in RIA called the Child and Family Services Unit, which is fully staffed and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  It also acts as a conduit between RIA and the HSE, the latter having statutory functions in this area.  Moreover, all staff in centres must be Garda vetted and comply with RIA's child protection policy, a copy of which is available on its website - www.ria.gov.ie.  This is in furtherance of RIA's policy which has as its principal aim the minimisation of risk to children and vulnerable adults residing in its centres. <\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of an independent external enquiry into the direct provision system ,I have already indicated that it cannot be viewed separately from the overall asylum and immigration system which is ultimately a matter of Government policy subject to scrutiny and oversight by the Oireachtas. Over the years, the system has been open to scrutiny by many national and international bodies. Centres have been visited by various international bodies, including the UNHCR, the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner, by the Council of Europe European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), and others.  On 6 October, 2011, in Geneva  I appeared before the UN Human Rights Committee in connection with its scrutiny of Ireland under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Process . No recommendation was made in relation to the Direct Provision system in the Committee's subsequent UPR report on Ireland. <\/p><p><br \/>  The practical day to day operation of the system is,of course subject to inspection, including independent inspection.. All accommodation centres under contract to RIA are obliged to ensure that their premises comply with and operate in accordance with all relevant statutory requirements of local authorities in relation to planning, building, bye-laws, bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions, and general safety. Inspections of the direct provision centres are carried out by RIA inspectors, an external Inspectorate (QTS Ltd), plus other inspections for fire safety and food safety (EHO). As already cited, a comprehensive review on the operation of the asylum seeker accommodation programme was carried out and the subsequent report -  <i>&quot;Value for Money and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme&quot; -  <\/i>  was published in May 2010. A copy of this review is available on the RIA website at www.ria.gov.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRV03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":976,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":977,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[19968\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Secretary General of his Department, for the purpose of transparency and accountability, will publish their diary on their website on a monthly basis.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":978,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that there are currently no plans to publish the diary of the Secretary General on the Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Insolvency Act","counter":979,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRW00350"},{"type":"question","counter":980,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[19979\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the professional qualifications and requirements that are required of a personal insolvency practitioner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":981,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[20026\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRW00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the safeguards that exist to ensure that personal insolvency practitioners act in an independent manner, particularly in vuew of the fact that PIPs will be constantly dealing with the same creditor banks where familiarity may undermine independence.","asker":"959","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":982,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 431 and 437 together.<\/p><p>  The independent role played by Personal Involvency Practitioners (PIPs) will be critical to the success of the new debt solutions under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  A PIP will have to be free from any undue influence, guidance or control by any other person that could prevent or hinder their performance of their functions under the Act.  Therefore it is important that we provide a strong regulatory framework that will cover the control and supervision of individuals who will provide services under the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act.<\/p><p>  All PIPs will be authorised and regulated by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, in accordance with Part 5 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 - Sections 159 to 169.  In Part 5 of the Act, Section 163 sets out how an individual may make application to carry on practice as a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, and Section 164 the matters which the Insolvency Service must take into account in deciding whether an applicant should be authorised as a PIP or whether authorisation is to be refused. <\/p><p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland will shortly publish the Regulations under Section 161 of the Act in regard to the authorisation and regulation of personal insolvency practitioners.  The Regulations will set out the necessary criteria in regard to qualifications.  As I have previously stated, I expect that accountants, lawyers and a broad range of financial advisors may wish to seek regulation as practitioners, but it will not be confined to these professions.  The qualifying criteria for becoming a practitioner will be rigorous and will be based on a series of important considerations such as educational and professional qualifications, relevant knowledge and experience, and the completion of a course of study - by passing an exam - on the laws and practice generally, as they apply in the State, in relation to the insolvency of individuals and knowledge of the Act.  Applicants will also have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Insolvency Service that they are fit and proper persons, that they are financially sound, and that they have the organisational capability and the resources to carry on the practice of being a practitioner.  They will have to hold professional indemnity insurance as well as being tax compliant. <\/p><p>  Where a person has concerns that improper conduct by a PIP has occurred or is occurring, they may make a complaint in writing to the Insolvency Service.  The Act provides that the Insolvency Service, following receipt of a complaint, or of its own volition, may investigate any improper conduct by a PIP.  This may result in the suspension or revocation of the authorisation of the personal insolvency practitioner or the imposition of sanctions in accordance with the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRW00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Peace Commissioners","counter":983,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRW00650"},{"type":"question","counter":984,"qnumday":432,"qnumall":"[19995\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRW00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide the full list of active and currently serving Peace Commissioners in an area (details supplied) in County Wicklow; the date of each of their appointments by him and his predecessors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":985,"content":"<p>My officials are collating the information which will be forwarded to the Deputy in the coming days.<b><font color=\"#000080\">   <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRW00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":986,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRW00850"},{"type":"question","counter":987,"qnumday":433,"qnumall":"[20007\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress made to date in determination of eligibility for residency in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":988,"content":"<p>The person concerned is a failed asylum applicant.

The Commission recognised both the negative and positive aspects of the court use of the poor box and accordingly recommended that the court poor box be replaced by a statutory reparation fund.  A key element of the LRC recommendation was that the reparation fund should be ringfenced and used to assist programmes aimed at preventing offending behaviour and for the purpose of assisting victims of crime.  The Commission was of the view that the reparation fund should remain linked to the criminal justice process and thus broadly adhere to the principles of restorative justice.

Section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 was repealed by section 3(e) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. <\/p><p>  Section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, which replaced section 17 of the 2000 Act, provides for the making of regulations specifying particulars to be affixed to containers in which  intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off licensed premises which would enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified.  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered the feasibility of such regulations in its 2008 Report.  The Group noted that while the labelling of alcohol containers was an attractive idea, significant challenges would need to be overcome in order to render it effective in practice.  These challenges arose under two headings.<\/p><p>  Firstly, practical difficulties would arise at retail level in cases where several individual containers were packaged together for sale, e.g. an enclosed six-pack of bottles; a plastic-wrapped tray of cans; or a wooden box containing bottles of wine.  This raised the question of whether an appropriate label could be attached earlier in the supply or distribution chains rather than at the point of sale.  The Group noted that attaching such labels to containers at an earlier stage might be simpler but it could create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors.  Moreover, in the case of imports from EU countries, such additional labelling requirements could be regarded as infringing internal market rules relating to free movement of such goods. <\/p><p>  Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, it was clear that possession by an underage person of a labelled container would not in itself constitute proof that the alcohol in the container has been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appeared on the container.  The labelled container could have been taken from the family home or have been sold to a person over the age of 18 in good faith before being passed on to the person in possession of it.  Indeed a container might have changed hands several times before coming into possession of the underage person. <\/p><p>  The Group also noted that according to answers already given to parliamentary questions on the subject, issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container had been raised during discussions on implementation of the 2003 Act with the Office of the Attorney General.  That Office had expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container and the overall effectiveness of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act. <\/p><p>  For the reasons set out above, I do not intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act.  I am however prepared to give serious consideration in the context of the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill to any reasonable and workable labelling proposal that would not give rise to the difficulties outlined in the 2008 Report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Numbers","counter":1042,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRX01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1043,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[20376\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of official Garda vehicles attached to Coolock Garda district in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1044,"content":"<p>Decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda vehicles are a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the context of his identified operational demands and in the light of available resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Garda vehicles attached to the Coolock District for the years requested by the Deputy was as outlined in the table below:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that an additional &euro;3 million was made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the end of last year which enabled the Force to procure a further 171 vehicles.

Extending these reliefs is not straightforward given that there is a requirement for EU State Aid approval for such measures.

Furthermore, the introduction in 2012 of an on-line mapping element allowed farmers, or their agents, who needed to submit maps to my Department, to do so through iNet, thereby dispensing with the need to submit paper maps. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRY02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences Numbers","counter":1116,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRY02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1117,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[20132\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRY02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of current valid licences that are in issue from his Department for salmon cage installations in counties Mayo, Galway and Clare; if all of these licences are being actively used; the person responsible for the maintenance of salmon cages; if these cages\/installations are inspected by his Department's officials on a regular basis; if he will provide a copy of the conditions of these licences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1108","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1118,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s records indicate that there are 18 aquaculture licences in use for the cultivation of salmon in the areas referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  These licences are either in-date or subject to the provisions of Section 19A(4) of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act.

It concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.

The Agency currently accepts a standard of 4 parts per million for naturally fluoridated water in the USA, which is 5 times higher than the levels for fluoridated water in Ireland. It should be noted that among those substances classed by the Agency in the same group as fluoride are common substances such as ethanol, ozone and chlorine dioxide as well as caffeine, which is found in tea and coffee and acrylamide, which is found in well browned toast and roast potatoes.<\/p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health has reviewed a number of studies over the years in relation to neurological effects. These studies have typically involved dosing laboratory rats with very high levels of fluoride. The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) review in 2011 referred to the Whitford study in which rats were given doses equivalent to 200 times the human exposure without demonstrating any neurological effects. <\/p><p>  A number of studies from China, and the systematic review of these by Choi (from the Harvard Medical School) which claim an effect on children's IQ at very high levels of naturally occurring fluoride, were assessed by the Expert Body in 2011 and were found to be of no relevance to Ireland, given our regulated fluoridation levels. The view of the Expert Body is that the overall design of the studies is poor and they do not provide evidence of any effect on children's IQ from either high or low fluoride levels. This view was shared by SCHER in its 2011 Review. It should be noted that the Deans of Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine have recently confirmed their support of water fluoridation as a safe public health measure for people of all ages. <\/p><p>  The Expert Body is satisfied that water fluoridation, at its optimal level, causes no ill effects.

I am not aware of any issues in relation to legislation introducing generic substitution in Canada.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill, passed Committee Stage on 19 March and is currently at Report Stage. Under the Bill, the Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.  In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:<\/p><p>  (a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group;<\/p><p>  (b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and<\/p><p>  (c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group.<\/p><p>In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where:<\/p><p> - there is a difference in bioavailability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them, and<\/p><p> - any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group.<\/p><p>  I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products the Board is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Bill and that these criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health\/HSE report 'Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution' (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill address the concerns raised in relation to the substitution of anti-epileptic drugs. I met with the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.

I assured them that my aim\u00a0is\u00a0to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making \u00a0the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.\u00a0\u00a0To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0 I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. \u00a0 I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups such as Longford Community Resources Ltd in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community. \u00a0However, given\u00a0 resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.\u00a0\u00a0 The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.<\/p><p>  Work has been underway over the last six months to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. This has involved consultations with the Department of the Environment, Community and\u00a0Local Government, the\u00a0County and\u00a0City\u00a0Managers Association and the rural Transport Network in the context of aligning the new structure with the local authority structure.<\/p><p>  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding\u00a0the County Longford area\u00a0or any other part of the country. I am awaiting proposals from the NTA when they have concluded their deliberations and discussions but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure\u00a0in the near future which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs. \u00a0 I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector. \u00a0Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRGG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":1473,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRGG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1474,"qnumday":607,"qnumall":"[19972\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRGG01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if the Secretary General of his Department, for the purpose of transparency and accountability, will publish their diary on their website on a monthly basis.","asker":"1103","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1475,"content":"<p>It is proposed to\u00a0publish\u00a0the Secretary General's diary\u00a0online for a number of months on a trial basis.\u00a0This initiative\u00a0will then be\u00a0reviewed in the light of whether there is any significant level of hits on the relevant page.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRGG01500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Semi-State Bodies Mergers","counter":1476,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRGG01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1477,"qnumday":608,"qnumall":"[19992\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000057#WRGG01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress made to date of the merger of the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency; the name of the amalgamated body; when he expects the merger to be complete; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1478,"content":"<p>The Government decided on 12th June 2012 to approve proposals for the merger of the National Roads Authority (NRA) and the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA).\u00a0 The General Scheme of a Bill to give legal effect to the merger was approved by Government on 21 February 2013.

In relation to both PRSI and USC, pension contributions are not deducted in arriving at the amounts payable.  However, social welfare payments are not liable to either PRSI or USC.   In relation to extending PRSI and USC to other forms of income not already subject to the charge, the position is that, in Budget 2013, I announced that the Minister for Social Protection, Ms. Joan Burton, T.D., would be bringing forward legislation to change PRSI contributions as follows:<\/p><p>- Where modified PRSI rate payers have income from a trade or profession, such income and any unearned income they have will be made subject to PRSI with effect from the <i>1st of January 2013<\/i>; and<\/p><p>- Unearned income for everyone else will become subject to PRSI in <i>2014<\/i>.  This means that PRSI will be payable on income generated from wealth such as rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings.<\/p><p>This means that from this year, modified rate contributors who have income from a profession or trade and who were previously not liable to PRSI on that income, are now liable to PRSI at 4% on such income.

A higher imputed distribution rate of 6% applies to ARFs and\/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs with asset values of more than &euro;2 million.  I assume the Deputy is suggesting an increase in the imputed distribution from 6% to 7% for ARFs and\/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs of more than &euro;2 million in value and an increase from 5% to 6% where the asset values are less than &euro;2 million.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information provided to them in the context of the tax paid on these deemed or imputed distributions does not include information on the value of the ARFs and\/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs out of which the distributions are deemed to arise.  There is therefore no basis on which a definitive estimate of the impact on the Exchequer of the change mentioned in the question could be compiled.<\/p><p>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the additional tax yield involved, some historical data made available to my Department from private sector sources provides a breakdown of ARFs by value in respect of a number of providers representing an estimated 40% of the ARF market.  There is no similar data available in relation to &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs.  Out of a total value of some &euro;2.4 billion in ARFs under management by these providers where the average ARF value was just over &euro;127,000, the total value of those ARFs representing individual funds under &euro;2 million was &euro;2.3 billion.  The total value of those ARFs representing individual funds of over &euro;2m was &euro;137 million.  Based on a very rough extrapolation of these figures to arrive at a broad potential estimate for the total value of ARFs with assets in these value ranges, the estimated additional income tax yield from applying increased imputed distribution rates to such ARFs as set out above would be about &euro;25 million in a full year.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the deemed or imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage draw downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement in the same way as a retirement annuity, for which ARFs are supposed to operate as a more flexible alternative.  The measure, in itself, does not give rise to significant tax revenues as it does not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs, which are taxed in the normal way.  Moreover, increasing the annual percentage notional distribution for ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs as suggested in the question would further increase the risk that the retirement income derived by the owners from such funds could be depleted before death.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000058#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":1513,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[20071\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000058#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount that could be raised for the Exchequer by reducing the earnings cap for pension contributions to &euro;70,000.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":1514,"content":"<p>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the current annual earnings cap of &euro;115,000 which operates to limit the level of tax-relieved personal pension contributions in any one year.

The increase in carbon tax is expected to deliver an additional &euro;16 million next year.  The increase in the capital acquisitions tax (CAT) is also expected to deliver an additional &euro;12 million in 2014 and the increase in DIRT an additional &euro;14 million.  These are just some of the main sources of positive carry-over from measures introduced as part of <i>Budget 2013<\/i>.  It is also important to consider that some the measures introduced as part of the Budget have a negative carry-over effect in 2014, for example the full year impact of the excise duty relief (estimated -&euro;35 million carry-over impact).  For further details the Deputy should consult pages A5 - A12 of the <i>Summary of 2013 Budget and Estimates Measures Policy Changes<\/i> section of the <i>Budget 2013<\/i>   book.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000058#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge Exemptions","counter":1521,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000058#WRF01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1522,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[20074\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000058#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost to the Exchequer of taking all those earning the minimum wage of &euro;17,542, out of the Universal Social Charge net.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":1523,"content":"<p>The current minimum wage is &euro;8.65 per hour.

These are Section 598 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (which in the main is aimed at individuals who dispose of their business or farming assets outside of the family) and Section 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (which is aimed at individuals who transfer their business or farming assets to their children).<\/p><p><br \/>  Both reliefs are aimed at smaller businesses and have been a feature of the capital gains tax system since its enactment in 1975. In the Finance Act of 2012 the terms of the relief were modified as follows:<blockquote>Under Section 598, full relief from capital gains tax is granted to an individual aged 55 or over but less than 66 years who disposes of a business or farm where the consideration does not exceed &euro;750,000.  Where the consideration exceeds &euro;750,000, any capital gains tax that may be payable is limited so that it cannot exceed 50% of the difference between the amount of the consideration and &euro;750,000.<br \/><br \/><br \/>  With effect from 1 January 2014, where an individual aged 66 or over disposes of a business or farm, the threshold by reference to which relief is granted is reduced to &euro;500,000, again with a limit on any capital gains tax payable, where the consideration exceeds &euro;500,000, so that it cannot exceed 50% of the difference between the amount of the consideration and &euro;500,000.<br \/><br \/><br \/>  As an interim measure, to facilitate any individual who wants to avail of the relief before the age and threshold changes take effect, an individual aged 66 or over who disposes of a business or farm in the year to 31 December 2013 will qualify for full relief by reference to the &euro;750,000 limit.<\/blockquote>  Under Section 599, which provides for relief for an individual who passes on his business or farm to his or her child, the relief operates on a similar basis to Section 598, except that the consideration limit is &euro;3 million (introduced in Finance Act 2012) and there is no marginal relief.  Therefore, any farmer aged 55 or over who passes on a farm to a child of his or hers which has a value of up to &euro;3 million will be entitled to full relief from capital gains tax.<\/p><p><br \/>  As I mentioned in my Budget Speech of 2012, the intention of modifying the retirement relief from Capital Gains Tax is to better incentivise the timely transfers of farms and businesses before the current owners reach the age of 66. This approach is in keeping with the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine of encouraging timely transfer of farm assets and improving the age profile of farming. Both the Commission on Taxation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine made recommendations regarding the capping of the Section 599 relief at &euro;3 million and these recommendations were considered in the context of the amendments made to the reliefs.  The intention of the more favourable reliefs for individuals who dispose of their businesses or farms between the ages of 55 and 66, relative to those who do so from 66 onwards is to encourage the passing on of those businesses or farms to a younger generation, thereby encouraging entrepreneurship and the increased productive use of business assets and farms.<\/p><p><br \/>  In your question you state that an 85 year old person could incur a capital gains tax liability of &euro;125,000. Based on the current rate of capital gains tax, this would mean that the person would have made a chargeable gain of in the region of &euro;380,000 and where the business or farm was sold, would have realised a significant consideration on the disposal.  In such circumstances, a contribution in the form of capital gains tax is considered appropriate. In the case of a farmer transferring his or her farm to a child, the threshold of &euro;3 million is considered to be sufficiently high to ensure that in all but the exceptionally large farms this threshold will ensure that no capital gains tax charge will arise.  If a capital gains tax charge should arise on the exceptionally large farms, it is considered appropriate that capital gains tax should be paid on any gain arising.  The changes to these reliefs will apply to disposals arising on or after 1 January 2014.  Accordingly, it is too soon to comment definitively on their impact at this stage.  However, the reliefs will be kept under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000058#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":1531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000058#WRF02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1532,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[20161\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000058#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will clarify the position on local property tax liability for adjoining living quarters of rate paying businesses that have no saleable value; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":1533,"content":"<p>Based on the information supplied by the Deputy it is not possible to give a definitive reply, however, by way of general information, the following may be of relevance in this case.  Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessed tax and is chargeable in respect of a building or a part of a building that is in use or that is suitable for use as a residence.  However, it is not chargeable on the part of a building in respect of which commercial rates are payable.  If the adjoining living quarters are not included for the purpose of commercial rates, the amount of LPT will be based on the &ldquo;chargeable value&rdquo; of the living quarters.<\/p><p>  According to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) the chargeable value of a residential property is defined as the price that the unencumbered fee simple of the property or the residential part of a property, might be expected to fetch on a sale on the open market were the property to be sold on the valuation date in a particular year in a manner that would secure the best possible price for the property and with the benefit of any access to the property that would have existed prior to the sale.  This type of hypothetical open market valuation applies to all types of residential property including residential property that is adjoined to or is contained within commercial property, where commercial rates are not payable on the residential element of the property.  The open market value is based on a hypothetical sale; therefore it is not relevant that there may be difficulties in selling a property or that there may be a limited market for a particular type of property.<\/p><p>  The owner of the business will be required to establish the chargeable value of the adjoining living quarters on 1 May 2013.  If the chargeable value is less than &euro;1m, the LPT liability will depend on the chargeable band into which this chargeable value falls. The rate of LPT on properties valued up to &euro;1 million is 0.18%.  As there is a banding system for properties the owner will not be required to provide a precise value for the adjoining living quarters if they are valued under &euro;1 million.  Properties valued over &euro;1m are liable at 0.18% on the first &euro;1 million in value and 0.25% on any balance over that amount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000058#WRF02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":1534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000058#WRF02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1535,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[20185\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000058#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will reconsider a probate (details supplied)","asker":"1049","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":1536,"content":"<p>This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.

Finance Act 2013 was passed into law on 27th March and section 17 of the Act, which makes provision for the pre-retirement access to AVCs announced in the Budget, has effect from that date. Section 17 introduces a new section 782A into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides members of occupational pension schemes with a three-year window of opportunity to draw down, on a once-off basis, up to 30% of the accumulated value of certain AVCs made by them, including additional voluntary PRSA contributions made to AVC PRSAs. Where AVCs are subject to a pension adjustment order, both parties to the order may exercise the option independently in respect of their respective \"share\" of the AVCs.<\/p><p>  The procedures set out in the legislation for exercising the AVC access option are straight forward and I have outlined these hereunder. However, in addition to these procedures, I am aware from discussions which my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have had with various pension industry representative bodies, that the administrators of AVC funds will also be putting administrative procedures and systems in place to facilitate the access option at an operational level. I understand that these administrative and systems procedures are in the process of being finalised.<\/p><p>  The likelihood is, of course, that an individual contemplating availing of the option will firstly contact his pension fund administrator by phone or email to establish what he or she needs to do. In that regard, the legislation requires the individual to give an irrevocable written instruction to the administrator of the fund that he or she wishes to avail of the option. Provided the individual qualifies for the encashment option, the administrator acts on the instruction by determining the value of the AVC fund and paying an amount, not exceeding 30% of the value, to the individual subject to deduction of the appropriate amount of tax. The amount paid is treated as emoluments to which Schedule E applies and tax is collected at source under the PAYE system. The legislation requires the administrator to deduct tax at the higher rate of 41%, unless the administrator has received from Revenue a tax credit certificate in respect of the individual. The payments are specifically exempt from USC and PRSI.<\/p><p>   I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in advance of any payment of AVCs being made, the individual exercising the option should contact his or her Revenue Office for a Certificate of Tax Credits and Standard Rate Cut-off point in respect of the AVC payment. It may be the case that the pension fund administrator will contact Revenue on behalf of the individual, but where the individual is applying directly to Revenue he or she would need to advise Revenue of the pension fund administrator's registered number (i.e. employer number) so that Revenue can forward the Certificate to the correct administrator. The Certificate will indicate the Standard Rate Cut-off Point and tax credits, if any, appropriate to the AVC access payment and facilitate the deduction of the correct amount of tax by the administrator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000059#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates Issues","counter":1565,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000059#WRG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1566,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[20368\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000059#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views regarding an increase in interest charges for homeowners who have variable mortgages with AIB, EBS and Haven; the effect that these increases will have on customers who are struggling to meet their mortgage repayments every month; if he will take steps to consult with the banks and building societies regarding this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":1567,"content":"<p>While the Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing in the current environment, ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial matter for the management and the Board of the Institution.

This framework is published on the Department of Finance website. I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.

While this decision by AIB is regrettable it is strictly a commercial decision by the board of AIB and I understand that this increase now brings AIB in line with the market average.

While there are no specific exemptions or financial concessions from LPT for householders in flood prone areas, the following information would be of relevance in these cases.  As LPT is a self-assessed tax, it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  For the purposes of LPT, properties valued under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands - an initial band from &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 and between &euro;100,001 and &euro;1 million a range of &euro;50,000 in each band - and property owners will not be required to provide a precise value for their property.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Revenue Commissioners have prepared valuation guidance which, together with the owner's own knowledge of her\/his property, will assist in assessing its value.

In this context, location and the risk of flooding are factors which are likely to impact on the market value of a property and which a property owner would generally take into account in valuing the property.

The Review recognised that \"many internationally orientated Irish companies preferred option is to raise capital overseas\". These companies may be able to exploit the funding opportunities offered by the JOBS Act.  The Government has taken a number of significant initiatives aimed at providing equity support for SMEs. The NPRF has announced two funds which will invest in SMEs. The SME Equity Fund (total fund size &euro;300 million - &euro;350 million \/ NPRF commitment &euro;125 million) will focus on investing in healthy businesses seeking to grow, including those with overleveraged balance sheets. The fund, which has received commitments from other-third party investors, is operational and is managed by Carlyle Cardinal Ireland.<\/p><p>  The SME Turnaround Fund (total effective fund size &euro;100 million \/ NPRF commitment &euro;50 million) will invest in underperforming businesses which are at or close to the point of insolvency but have the potential for financial and operational restructuring. Typically 40 per cent of the capital invested by the fund will be used to buy the business and 60 per cent will be used to finance the turnaround in order to place it on a sustainable long-term footing. The fund is also operational and is managed by Better Capital.<\/p><p>  In addition, the NPRF is also currently reviewing additional SME fund opportunities that would complement these funds, with the objective that the eventual suite of funds would have the capacity to invest across the full spectrum of SME financing needs.<\/p><p>  The 10 point Tax reform plan to help small business announced in the 2013 budget is another initiative which is aimed at assisting SMEs gain access to funding. These measures complement measures already being undertaken by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and bodies under its aegis. In particular, Innovation Fund Ireland and Development Capital Fund Ireland provide equity for SMEs.<\/p><p>  The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme addresses the situation where the SME is outside the risk appetite of the banks. This can arise because the SME's lack of collateral or the banks' lack of understanding of the business model, the market, the sector or the technology. The three main SME lenders are all participating in the Guarantee scheme.<\/p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme will provide loans of up to &euro;25k to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, who have commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.<\/p><p>  The SME State Bodies Group was established in 2012 to both develop key policy initiatives to support SME access to credit and other forms of finance, and to ensure their implementation. It will continue in 2013 to engage intensively in proactively addressing issues associated with SME funding and financing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders through the SME Funding Consultation Committee. My officials also meet frequently with additional stakeholders who wish to contribute to policy development in relation to access to finance.<\/p><p>  One of the actions assigned to the State Bodies Group under the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is to \"Investigate the potential for alternative funding mechanisms including peer to peer lending, supply chain finance and crowdfunding.\"<\/p><p>  A matrix on SME funding has been completed and published on Department of Finance website and smallbusinessfinance.ie website. This matrix outlines various sources of funding available to SME and provides contact information for them.<\/p><p>  Crowd funding is in its infancy in Ireland. I am aware of a peer to peer credit website which was recently launched in Ireland. Irish entities, particularly in the creative fields, have accessed other crowd funding sites.

Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability\/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability.

Public procurement in Ireland is governed by legal requirements, rules and guidelines set both at national and EU level. The general requirements for goods and general services are set out in the Public Procurement Guidelines - Competitive Process 2004 (revised), whilst those for works and works-related contracts are set out in the Capital Works Management Framework. This guidance incorporates key elements of EU legislation that have been transposed into Irish law and is complemented by circulars and guidance issued by my Department and the National Procurement Service.<\/p><p><br \/>  The most important of the guidance published by my Department includes:<\/p><p><i>- Public Procurement Guidelines - Competitive Process 2004<\/i>  , in respect of the procurement of services and supplies - highlighting the need for a competitive process in respect of contracts below the EU threshold values;<\/p><p><i>- Circular 10\/10<\/i>   - require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts;<\/p><p><i>- the Capital Works Management Framework<\/i>   - provides a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents are available to download for all contracting authorities to provide a consistent approach to the management of public works projects; and<\/p><p><i>- Standardisation and simplification of tender documentation (for supplies and services)<\/i>   - In order to reduce the costs involved in participating or conducting the procurement function, the National Procurement Service has published a suite of model tendering and contract documents which help businesses and buyers to reduce costs. <\/p><p>All regulations, circulars, guidelines and standard forms are available on the Government's eTenders website at: <i><i>www.eTenders.gov.ie <\/i><\/i>for goods and general services and at <i><i>www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie   <\/i><\/i>for construction works and related services.<\/p><p>Under EU Directive on public procurement contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria. For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;130,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;200,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;400,000. For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website <i><i>www.etenders.gov.ie  <\/i><\/i> or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers.<\/p><p><br \/>  The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department is currently participating at EU level in the review of EU Directives: 2004\/17\/EC (procurement in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors) and 2004\/18\/EC (public works, supply and service contracts). Whilst discussions on the revision of these Directives are currently underway, it is clear that one of the key reforms will be the introduction of an EU wide eProcurement procedure which will facilitate shorter procurement procedures.<\/p><p><br \/>  The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.  In relation to delays being experienced by some local authorities in public procurement processes, these are matters for my colleague Deputy Phil Hogan, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000061#WRJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Referendum Expenditure","counter":1702,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000062#WRK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1703,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[20172\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000062#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the total costs incurred from the Central Fund in holding the Referendum on Children&rsquo;s Rights in 2012; the breakdown of those costs including the cost of establishing a Referendum Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":1704,"content":"<p>The Referendum on the Protection of Children was held on the 10th November, 2012.

The Valuation Office operates within the employment control framework set by Government for the public service which imposes an overall staffing ceiling for the Office on an annual basis. In line with this policy, the current staffing complement of the Valuation Office is 135, representing 132.40 whole time equivalent posts. The appointment of officers to carry out the valuation of properties is the function of the Commissioner which he exercises under his powers of delegation set out in section 11 of the Act.  There are two provisions in the legislation governing the assessment of valuations, i.e. revision and revaluation.<\/p><p>  Revision of valuation is the mechanism used to maintain existing local authority valuation lists. It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. The valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined by reference to the net annual values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. That is to say that they are compared with similar type properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated equally. While there are some arrears of casework in this area, it is not significant and in any event, revision applications received from the public are disposed of without undue delay. While there has been a marked decrease in the number of applications for revision of valuation in recent years, mainly due to the economic downturn, the vast majority of applications are from the local authorities with whom the Valuation Office is in close liaison, to ensure that priority cases are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and to agree timelines for the delivery of revisions generally.<\/p><p>  In a revaluation the entire commercial valuation list for a local authority is brought up-to-date by reference to values at a specific valuation date and the entire list is published on one date (usually 31 December) and comes into effect for rating purposes on 1 January the following year.  To-date, revaluations of the commercial list have been completed in South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire County Council areas and the revaluation programme for the Dublin City Council area is currently underway and is expected to be completed by 31st December, 2013. Additionally, the revaluation of properties in all the local authority areas of Waterford and Limerick will be completed in 2013 and 2014 respectively.<\/p><p>  The Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2012 which had its second stage reading in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11th October, 2012 provides for a number of initiatives  to accelerate the overall revaluation programme, such as the piloting of a self-assessment scheme of valuation in one local authority area, which if it proves successful could be extended to other areas. There is also provision in the Bill to allow for the assessment of valuations by contract valuers under an external delivery scheme which is also being initiated as a pilot project. The Bill also contains provisions to streamline the overall process of revaluation and the appeal mechanisms available to ratepayers subsequent to the revaluation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000062#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":1714,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000062#WRK00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1715,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[19894\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000062#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount the State spent on lighting in State owned or operated public buildings in 2012.","asker":"1048","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":1716,"content":"<p>Lighting is not metered separately in the vast majority of public buildings.

Two specialist sub-divisional courts will be established, one in London for cases involving &lsquo;chemistry patents&rsquo; (including pharmaceutical products) and the other in Munich for mechanical engineering cases.<\/p><p>  2) Local division: It is possible under the Agreement for each contracting State to set up a local division.  <\/p><p>  3) Regional division: The option also exists under the Agreement to form a regional division i.e. where two or more contracting states would join together to function as a local division for participating countries.  <\/p><p>  Thus, Contracting States will have the option to set up a local division of the Court, join a possible regional division or, confer jurisdiction on the central division of the Court alone.  All States intending to ratify the UPC Agreement will need to decide, in advance of ratification, on the particular Court structure that it proposes to adopt.  As Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the UPC arrangement raises issues that fall within the remit of jurisdictional arrangements in the Courts area generally and thus are of interest to my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, my Department is in contact with that Department on this issue.  <\/p><p>  In relation to arbitration and mediation under the UPC Agreement, Lisbon and Ljubljana will host Patent Arbitration and Mediation Centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000063#WRL00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Companies Law Issues","counter":1761,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000063#WRL00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1762,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[20028\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000063#WRL01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the fact that separate accounts for Ireland are not available for many consumer multinational companies operating here.","asker":"959","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":1763,"content":"<p>The contents of the financial statements of companies are governed by relevant EU Company Law Directives and Regulations and by the applicable accounting standards.  <\/p><p>  The requirements regarding the preparation and publication of the accounts of limited companies and groups are determined by the First, Fourth and Seventh EU Company Law Directives and by the EU IFRS Regulations.

The preferred criterion of the World Health Organisation is weight, as it is more objectively determined than gestational age.

It is important to remember that control savings are not actual monies recovered by the Department but are a good indication of the increase in social welfare expenditure that would occur without these activities taking place.  Without this control work, social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount.  These activities also have a deterrent or knock-on effect, which are not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.<\/p><p>  Controls are exercised at both the initial claim stage and at subsequent stages during the claim life cycle. Claims are reviewed on a regular and targeted basis. Means-tested payments are reviewed at certain intervals or when there are indications that changes in circumstances have not been reported to the Department. Those in receipt of illness payments are called for a medical examination by the Department's medical assessors.  Customers in receipt of unemployment payments are checked on a regular basis to verify continued compliance with such requirements as being available for and genuinely seeking employment.<\/p><p>  Current measures to control fraud and abuse also include desk reviews of claim papers, home visits, the issue of mail-shots to selected customers, database checking and data matching with other organisations.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit focuses on planned and systematic control activity and projects.

The government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the gradual implementation of a guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided. <\/font>    Other relevant provision is made through the training and education programmes delivered through F&Aacute;S and the further education sector.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The size and the timescale for any additional provision that is both desirable and feasible, over and above that outlined above, will be established over the coming months.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">In this context, the Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a youth guarantee in Ireland. We have sought funding from the European Commission for a proposed pilot Youth Guarantee Scheme (YGS) in the Ballymun area of north Dublin, and numerous organisations (e.g. IBEC, Ballymun Job Centre, National Youth Council of Ireland) have agreed to participate in this pilot. We are currently waiting to hear from the European Commission as to whether or not our application has been successful. We have been informed that a final decision on our application will be made by the end of June.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Subject to approval from the Commission, the proposed Ballymun YGS pilot will look to develop an activation approach tailored to the needs of young people.  It is intended that the Ballymun pilot YGS will, in respect of the target group of young people, guarantee access to career guidance\/assistance leading to identification of an individual career plan for the young unemployed person with follow-through to training, education, work experience or full-time employment.  Depending on the needs of the young individual the steps in the career plan might include personal assessment, job search assistance, skills training, work experience internships, but the objective in all cases will be to lead the young person to employment placement or further education or training. A particular focus of the pilot YGS will be to involve, and build links with, employers in the locality and the immediate hinterland in order to ensure that the guidance and training elements of the YGS are tailored to the needs of the local labour market and also to generate work placement\/experience opportunities for the YGS participants.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRO01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":1891,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRO01250"},{"type":"question","counter":1892,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[20248\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRO01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the average waiting time, in the past twelve months for a review, in line with the relevant social welfare legislation, to be carried out by the Chief Appeals Officer, of appeals already decided by appeals officers.","asker":"1015","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1893,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the information sought by the Deputy is not available.<\/p><p>  Processing times in relation to appeals are measured and reported by an ICT system in the Appeals Office.

This was in keeping with the recommendations of Justice Quirke following the Peatlands Forum and with the motion agreed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 7th   of March.<\/p><p>  My Department has now engaged a team of specialists who are undertaking the necessary scientific work to underpin the National Plan and to inform the future restoration and management of each of the SACs. This work is being overseen by an independent steering group with input from the Peatlands Council. Draft proposals for each of the sites will be discussed with affected parties as part of this process. <\/p><p>  The detailed exploration of relocation sites is a key element in progressing the National Plan. In collaboration with the Peatlands Council, and with the assistance of Bord na M&oacute;na, my Department is actively engaging with turf cutting communities to consider how relocation can be progressed. <\/p><p>  The aim of my Department is to facilitate, as far as possible, those qualifying cutters who wish to continue to cut turf by putting in place relocation sites for as many cutters as possible in the shortest possible time. Given the complexities of the process it can take time to resolve all issues to finality even as new sites come on stream. The provision of financial payments or deliveries of turf is available to those awaiting relocation. My officials will continue to work with local groups on these issues within the principles of the relocation scheme.<\/p><p>  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made for groups from Clara Bog in County Offaly and from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog in County Galway. <\/p><p>  My Department also envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during this turf cutting season provided that final agreement is reached with relevant cutters.<\/p><p>  Of the remaining 49 raised bog SACs, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation.<\/p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na undertook a preliminary assessment of a potential relocation site for turf cutters on Coolrain Bog Special Area of Conservation on behalf of my Department. On the basis of this assessment, Bord na M&oacute;na has undertaken a stratigraphy assessment of this site in order to get a better indication of the quality and quantity of peat there. The stratigraphy report has recently been received by my Department. Officials from my Department will contact turf cutter representatives from Coolrain Bog shortly with a view to discussing the report and other relevant issues. <\/p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants from Coolrain Bog while awaiting relocation to a non-designated bog. <\/p><p>  The continuation of cutting on parts of any raised bog SAC,  such as Coolrain, may only be considered within the strict parameters of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive, which prescribe the circumstances under which potentially damaging activities can be consented to. In the context of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, it may be possible to bring some flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, that could allow limited cutting within a small number of sites, if there are no alternatives. <\/p><p>  I am determined that, in collaboration with the Peatlands Council and local turf-cutting communities, substantial progress will be made on the plan over the coming months. My Department has stepped up contact with turf-cutting groups to seek long-term solutions to the issues for their particular bogs, in compliance with EU and national law. I hope that the Plan can be completed by November, in time to submit an application to the European Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, if required, prior to the 2014 cutting season. <\/p><p>  However, the engagement and agreement of turf-cutting communities to its proposed approaches will be essential to meeting this timeline, and to unlocking the potential flexibility it offers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRP04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation Appeals","counter":1973,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1974,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[20381\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when an SAC appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) will take place; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1975,"content":"<p>I understand that the appellant in question is one of a number for this site who have already opted for a Stage 2 formal hearing of their case before the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board.

The last Budget specifically contained a ten point tax reform plan to support small businesses. The measures contained in the Budget are intended to assist small businesses in a number of ways, including:helping their cash flow position; helping them access funding more easily; reducing the costs associated with the administrative burden of tax compliance; boosting demand for their products in new markets abroad; incentivising firms to create jobs.<\/p><p>  As regards labour costs for small and medium enterprises, the economy has in recent years achieved very significant improvements. The European Commission, in its most recent forecast, projected that Irish unit labour costs will improve by 23 per cent relative to the euro area average over the period 2009 to 2014.  <\/p><p>  In this regard, I have been engaged in a continuous process of reform to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers. Last year, I reduced the overall number of Joint Labour Committees (JLCs). I asked the Labour Court to undertake a review of remaining JLC's in line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act which I introduced last year. Last week, the Labour Court submitted to me its Review on the Reform of the remaining JLC's. I view this report very much within the context of the continuous process of reform in the area that is designed to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers. Specifically, the Report suggests a template on how many Committees will continue in existence, and the format within which they will operate over the next five years. <\/p><p>  The Government is determined to maintain a focus on competitiveness and, to that end, Forf&aacute;s, in conjunction with my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection has been tasked under the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to assess the potential for further actions to support improvements in labour market competitiveness.<\/p><p>  Finally, my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, recently announced details of a new initiative, the JobsPlus scheme, which will incentivise businesses to hire additional employees from the Live Register.

There is potential for maximising synergies while addressing the possible trade-offs between competitiveness, security of supply and sustainability.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Commissioner Oettinger attended the Informal Meeting. He highlighted how any new framework should take into account current economic difficulties whilst remaining ambitious on the long-term low carbon objective.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The Council of Energy Ministers also discussed the effects of unconventional oil and gas on energy supply, competitiveness and prices.  In relation to the work currently underway by the European Commission on unconventional hydrocarbon extraction, the Irish Presidency requested that the Commission would reflect on the debate among Ministers in Dublin, particularly on the global competitiveness and security of supply aspects, and to take those views into consideration in their work on the matter, having regard to legitimate environmental and safety considerations.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The two days of discussions were informed by the goal of full implementation of the internal energy market.  Ministers agreed that this is not an end in itself, but rather, it must bring tangible benefits to all energy consumers.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">On the issue of the links between smart technology, innovation and energy policy, I concluded that the ultimate objective in rolling out standardised smart meters and smart grids across Europe must be value and benefit driven, with a specific consumer focus. In so doing, we must recognise the energy needs, circumstances and IT capabilities of all categories of consumers.  Data protection concerns should also be considered and addressed.  The need for public awareness campaigns on the potential advantages was acknowledged and the benefits must be clear to all individual energy customers and management of energy consumption.  Product and price analysis must be simple and straightforward.  Suppliers will also have a responsibility to build consumer trust given the huge volume on data in question.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The financing of energy efficiency measures was also discussed. Realising the energy efficiency potential of buildings is central to the EU's energy efficiency policy.  Nearly 40% of final energy is consumed in homes, offices and shops.  The challenge that faces Energy Ministers is to find the necessary finance to underpin the energy retrofit renovation that is required as part of our 2020 energy and climate goals.

National energy circumstances are also important, as we strive to reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I look forward to continuing discussions on identifying a robust 2030 framework which will facilitate long term European competitiveness and security of supply. Europe must maintain its leadership position in the transition to a low carbon future, particularly with regard to energy efficient and clean technology, products and services.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I should also highlight that the Council of Ministers agreed that I would write to President Van Rompuy to update him on our deliberations which the Ministers wish to see inputted to the forthcoming Council of Europe meeting in May.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries","counter":1990,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1991,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[19884\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of salmon that came through the fish counter on the Feale in County Kerry during the first three months of 2013 on a monthly basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":1992,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[19885\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"netmen of the Cashen caught 1509 Salmon in 2012, the number of salmon they caught in each of the months of June, July, August, that is what is the breakdown of the 1509 figure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":1993,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[19886\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"presently there are 49 commercial nets in the Cashen, if that figure has to be reduced, the piece of primary legislation that needs to be amended or is the decision to allow 49 nets addressed through Statutory Instrument S.I on a year by year basis and signed by the Minister of the day; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1994,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 to 357, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The River Feale counter is located approximately 5 kilometres downstream of Listowel Town in the townland of Scartleigh at the Kerry County Council water abstraction plant.<\/p><p>The counter is a one channel counter operated on a crump which was installed to assist fish over the large weir.  I am advised the counter works very well on this site.  However fish have been seen travelling over the weir outside of the fish pass in high water conditions so it is not a complete count but it counts the majority of the fish.<\/p><p>Table A below represents the number of fish that have traversed the counter for January, February and March of 2013. These figures are available from Inland Fisheries Ireland through the Limerick office.<\/p><p>Table B below represents the breakdown of 1,509 for the commercial catch for June, July and August 2012.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware the final 10kms of the course of the River Feale is known as the Cashen River and there are 49 public commercial draft net licences and 2 private commercial draft net licences on the River.  The number of licences available for draft net operations is set out in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order currently S.I. 75 of 2013.  This Order authorises the issue of commercial fishing licences by Inland Fisheries Ireland and sets out the criteria under which those licences may be issued and prescribes the maximum number of commercial licences that may be issued.<\/p><p>The mechanism for controlling the take of salmon by the commercial fishery is not by licence number but by quota.  Each year commercial fishermen apply for commercial licences and are assessed against criteria as set out in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order which gives priority to established fishermen with a recent history of fishing in the fishery.  All applications are put before the Board of Inland Fisheries Ireland for approval.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the Total Allowable Catch (quota set) determines the number of fish that can be harvested regardless of the number of licences in operation.  The Total Allowable Catch is the surplus available above the conservation limit for the river that can be harvested.  This allows for the sustainable exploitation of the river whilst conserving the required number of spawning fish for the system.<\/p><p>The surplus available for 2013 for the River Feale is 1,992 fish.  This quota is divided between the commercial fishermen and recreational anglers by the River Basin District Director following consultation with the Fisheries District Committee.  The quota is identified by the National Standing Committee for Salmon following assessment of all the relevant scientific data for the river in question including catch figures for the previous 5 years and any other relevant data.  This is set out in the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Scheme Regulations S.I. 556 2012 which sets the quota for the Feale including the Galey and Brick rivers at 1,992 for exploitation by commercial and rod and line licensed fishermen in 2013.<\/p><p><b>Table A - Fish Counter<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>2013 Month<\/th><th>Feale Counter Figure (Up Only)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>January<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>February<\/td><td>32<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>March<\/td><td>86<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total to date<\/td><td>135<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><b>Table B- Commercial Catch<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>2012 Month <\/th><th>Commercial Catch<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>June<\/td><td>221<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>July<\/td><td>1040<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August<\/td><td>248<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":1995,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1996,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[19960\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if the Secretary General of his Department, for the purpose of transparency and accountability, will publish their diary on their website on a monthly basis.","asker":"1103","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1997,"content":"<p>I can confirm that arrangements will be put in place shortly to publish the diary of the Secretary General of my Department on the website of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":1998,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1999,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[20004\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRQ02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will identify all broadband blackspots in counties Longford and Westmeath.","asker":"1065","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2000,"content":"<p>The State can only intervene in the broadband market to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services.

International comparisons do not take account of high speed services at speeds up to and exceeding 1 gigabit per second which are contracted by heavy users of such service for use using leased lines or comparable links.  Furthermore, International comparison tables are based on marketed services which do not take account of actual accessibility to those speeds within any state nor do they take account of the actual customer experience which may differ from state to state.<\/p><p>  In Ireland high capacity broadband links over leased lines, which are capable of meeting the needs of heavy users including hospitals, schools, local authorities and third level educational institutions, are widely available.  However, as mentioned above, these services are not included in international comparisons.  In the case of post primary schools the Government has announced plans to equip all post primary schools with 100Mbps broadband.  This programme is continuing and all schools will be connected by the start of the 2014 academic year <\/p><p>  In the case of marketed broadband services, data reports published by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), reveal that the number of broadband subscribers has more than doubled in Ireland to over 1.6 million between 2007 and 2012.  Similarly, in the case of speeds, the number of residential customers contracted in a range between 2&ndash;10 megabits per second (Mbps) increased from 41% of all subscribers in 2007 to 71% in 2012.  The number of subscribers accessing speeds exceeding 10 Mbps increased from 0.2% to 24% in the same period.  95% of customers are therefore contracted at speeds of 2 Mbps or more compared to an EU average availability at 2 Mbps or more over fixed lines of 92%.<\/p><p>  In the case of comparing the fastest marketed speeds, the most recently published OECD data ranks Ireland 16th   fastest of more than 30 countries surveyed for fastest advertised retail broadband speed.<\/p><p>  Subject to the cautions expressed above about interpreting international comparison tables, it can be concluded that there has been significant growth in the take up of marketed retail broadband services and contracted speeds in Ireland in recent years and, in addition, high bandwidth is widely available in Ireland over leased lines.  The take up of basic broadband in Ireland at speeds of 2 Mbps or more compares favourably with similar accessibility as an EU average.  The availability of high speed services is also increasing rapidly with UPC now offering speeds of 150Mbps to almost 700,000 homes and Eircom preparing to launch new next generation fixed line services.  Mobile operators are also preparing to launch high speed 4G services following ComReg&rsquo;s successful conclusion of the multi band spectrum auction.  The Government has committed to ensuring that broadband speeds of at least 30Mbps are available in all parts of Ireland.  This will require intervention by the State in areas where there is no case for investment by the commercial market.  My Department is in the process of appointing consultants to assist in developing the necessary mapping, EU State Aids and procurement process for this intervention.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan (NBP) therefore anticipates that all parts of Ireland will have access to 30Mbps broadband well ahead of the EU target date of 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRR01600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":2034,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[20403\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRR01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which he has identified areas throughout the country known to be particularly problematic in respect of access to high-speed broadband; if he has examined a means where these issues can be addressed effectively in the short and medium term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2035,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  <\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.

This innovative job creation scheme is focused on the long-term unemployed, providing a cash-flow benefit to businesses which hire jobseekers who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRT00900","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Principal Private Residence Charge Yield","counter":2064,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRT00950"},{"type":"question","counter":2065,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[20055\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRT01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amount that was raised for the Exchequer from the second home tax in 2012; and the amount estimated to be raised in 2013.","asker":"959","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2066,"content":"<p>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009   broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on no n-principal private residences.

My Department also provides funding to local authorities to support their efforts in this area.   <\/p><p>  While I currently have no plans to launch a national litter and illegal dumping awareness campaign on television and national radio, I have recently allocated &euro;900,000 to local authorities from Environment Fund under the 2013 Anti-Litter &amp;amp; Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grants Scheme.  My Department has co-funded these grants for local authority anti-litter awareness and education initiatives since 1997.  Under this scheme, local authorities are responsible for selecting suitable projects for funding and deciding on individual grant allocations.  The scheme requires that projects selected should promote greater public awareness and education in relation to both litter and graffiti.  They should also, where possible, focus on voluntary initiatives by community and environmental groups and involve schools and young people in anti-litter and anti-graffiti action.  Typically, eligible projects include local media campaigns, clean-ups, primary\/secondary school competitions, exhibitions and the production of videos, posters and leaflets.  The maximum grant for a project may be up to 70% of the cost, with the balance being met by local contributions. <\/p><p>  My Department has also taken several steps to combat the problem of small scale illegal dumping in recent times.  In summer 2012, I launched a national campaign in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency and supported by the print media, to highlight the economic value of our environment and encouraging the public to report all incidences of illegal dumping to the Agency's National Environmental Complaints hotline at 1850 365 121.

There are currently 35 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA, providing accommodation and ancillary services to 4,715 persons.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Direct Provision system remains a key pillar of the State's asylum and immigration system and I have no plans to end it.  I, and previous Ministers for Justice and Equality, have explained in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the normal structures dealing with homelessness could not cope when the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland increased dramatically, and how the Direct Provision system was the only realistic accommodation solution.  There are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.  In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. This was a key finding in the recent Value for Money Report on the direct provision system which was published in 2010 and is on the RIA website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie.<\/i>   I have also explained the nature of the full board accommodation system provided; how RIA coordinates through other Government bodies a number of ancillary services to residents; how residents are offered free medical screening on arrival in the State and have access to health services; and how residents have access to primary and secondary education services, on the same basis as Irish citizens.<\/p><p><br \/>  The practical effect of limiting the time spent by children spent in Direct Provision to six months is that the system itself becomes largely inoperable beyond that period for all residents. The alternative is the granting of the right to work and an extensive range of mainstreamed social and housing supports which, for the reasons given above, is not a realistic policy option.  That said, I have acknowledged that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process is an issue to be addressed.  The accommodation system is inextricably linked to the surrounding asylum process. The revised Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications. This work is being given high priority and applicants will be advised of the new arrangements as soon as possible. <\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the psychological needs of asylum seekers in direct provision, including their children, all such persons are entitled to the same level of medical - including psychological - care as persons residing in the general community. Asylum seekers are, by definition, a category of persons who arrived in this country seeking protection from harm.  They are disconnected from their home country, from family and from their social network. Decisions as to whether there needs to be specific research into the psychological needs of a particular set of children is ultimately a matter for the HSE to determine. In this context, it should be noted that the medical and psychological services provided to asylum seekers are at least on a par with those provided to the community generally. Some additional supports such as psychological supports focussed specifically on asylum seekers are also provided. Other organisations also provide supports locally and nationally, many of which (such as Spirasi's Centre for the Survivors of Torture) receive funding from the HSE.<\/p><p><br \/>  In this connection, it cannot be emphasised enough that RIA takes the issue of child welfare, and the protection of residents generally, very seriously. RIA has had a child protection policy, based on the HSE's Children First Policy, in place since 2006. There is a specific unit in RIA called the Child and Family Services Unit, which is fully staffed and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  It also acts as a conduit between RIA and the HSE, the latter having statutory functions in this area.  Moreover, all staff in centres must be Garda vetted and comply with RIA's child protection policy, a copy of which is available on its website - www.ria.gov.ie.  This is in furtherance of RIA's policy which has as its principal aim the minimisation of risk to children and vulnerable adults residing in its centres. <\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of an independent external enquiry into the direct provision system ,I have already indicated that it cannot be viewed separately from the overall asylum and immigration system which is ultimately a matter of Government policy subject to scrutiny and oversight by the Oireachtas. Over the years, the system has been open to scrutiny by many national and international bodies. Centres have been visited by various international bodies, including the UNHCR, the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner, by the Council of Europe European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), and others.  On 6 October, 2011, in Geneva  I appeared before the UN Human Rights Committee in connection with its scrutiny of Ireland under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Process . No recommendation was made in relation to the Direct Provision system in the Committee's subsequent UPR report on Ireland. <\/p><p><br \/>  The practical day to day operation of the system is,of course subject to inspection, including independent inspection.. All accommodation centres under contract to RIA are obliged to ensure that their premises comply with and operate in accordance with all relevant statutory requirements of local authorities in relation to planning, building, bye-laws, bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions, and general safety. Inspections of the direct provision centres are carried out by RIA inspectors, an external Inspectorate (QTS Ltd), plus other inspections for fire safety and food safety (EHO). As already cited, a comprehensive review on the operation of the asylum seeker accommodation programme was carried out and the subsequent report -  <i>&quot;Value for Money and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme&quot; -  <\/i>  was published in May 2010. A copy of this review is available on the RIA website at www.ria.gov.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRV03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":2199,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2200,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[19968\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Secretary General of his Department, for the purpose of transparency and accountability, will publish their diary on their website on a monthly basis.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2201,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that there are currently no plans to publish the diary of the Secretary General on the Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Insolvency Act","counter":2202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRW00350"},{"type":"question","counter":2203,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[19979\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the professional qualifications and requirements that are required of a personal insolvency practitioner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":2204,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[20026\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRW00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the safeguards that exist to ensure that personal insolvency practitioners act in an independent manner, particularly in vuew of the fact that PIPs will be constantly dealing with the same creditor banks where familiarity may undermine independence.","asker":"959","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2205,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 431 and 437 together.<\/p><p>  The independent role played by Personal Involvency Practitioners (PIPs) will be critical to the success of the new debt solutions under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  A PIP will have to be free from any undue influence, guidance or control by any other person that could prevent or hinder their performance of their functions under the Act.  Therefore it is important that we provide a strong regulatory framework that will cover the control and supervision of individuals who will provide services under the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act.<\/p><p>  All PIPs will be authorised and regulated by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, in accordance with Part 5 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 - Sections 159 to 169.  In Part 5 of the Act, Section 163 sets out how an individual may make application to carry on practice as a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, and Section 164 the matters which the Insolvency Service must take into account in deciding whether an applicant should be authorised as a PIP or whether authorisation is to be refused. <\/p><p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland will shortly publish the Regulations under Section 161 of the Act in regard to the authorisation and regulation of personal insolvency practitioners.  The Regulations will set out the necessary criteria in regard to qualifications.  As I have previously stated, I expect that accountants, lawyers and a broad range of financial advisors may wish to seek regulation as practitioners, but it will not be confined to these professions.  The qualifying criteria for becoming a practitioner will be rigorous and will be based on a series of important considerations such as educational and professional qualifications, relevant knowledge and experience, and the completion of a course of study - by passing an exam - on the laws and practice generally, as they apply in the State, in relation to the insolvency of individuals and knowledge of the Act.  Applicants will also have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Insolvency Service that they are fit and proper persons, that they are financially sound, and that they have the organisational capability and the resources to carry on the practice of being a practitioner.  They will have to hold professional indemnity insurance as well as being tax compliant. <\/p><p>  Where a person has concerns that improper conduct by a PIP has occurred or is occurring, they may make a complaint in writing to the Insolvency Service.  The Act provides that the Insolvency Service, following receipt of a complaint, or of its own volition, may investigate any improper conduct by a PIP.  This may result in the suspension or revocation of the authorisation of the personal insolvency practitioner or the imposition of sanctions in accordance with the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRW00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Peace Commissioners","counter":2206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRW00650"},{"type":"question","counter":2207,"qnumday":432,"qnumall":"[19995\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRW00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide the full list of active and currently serving Peace Commissioners in an area (details supplied) in County Wicklow; the date of each of their appointments by him and his predecessors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2208,"content":"<p>My officials are collating the information which will be forwarded to the Deputy in the coming days.<b><font color=\"#000080\">   <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRW00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":2209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRW00850"},{"type":"question","counter":2210,"qnumday":433,"qnumall":"[20007\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress made to date in determination of eligibility for residency in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2211,"content":"<p>The person concerned is a failed asylum applicant.

The Commission recognised both the negative and positive aspects of the court use of the poor box and accordingly recommended that the court poor box be replaced by a statutory reparation fund.  A key element of the LRC recommendation was that the reparation fund should be ringfenced and used to assist programmes aimed at preventing offending behaviour and for the purpose of assisting victims of crime.  The Commission was of the view that the reparation fund should remain linked to the criminal justice process and thus broadly adhere to the principles of restorative justice.

Section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 was repealed by section 3(e) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. <\/p><p>  Section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, which replaced section 17 of the 2000 Act, provides for the making of regulations specifying particulars to be affixed to containers in which  intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off licensed premises which would enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified.  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered the feasibility of such regulations in its 2008 Report.  The Group noted that while the labelling of alcohol containers was an attractive idea, significant challenges would need to be overcome in order to render it effective in practice.  These challenges arose under two headings.<\/p><p>  Firstly, practical difficulties would arise at retail level in cases where several individual containers were packaged together for sale, e.g. an enclosed six-pack of bottles; a plastic-wrapped tray of cans; or a wooden box containing bottles of wine.  This raised the question of whether an appropriate label could be attached earlier in the supply or distribution chains rather than at the point of sale.  The Group noted that attaching such labels to containers at an earlier stage might be simpler but it could create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors.  Moreover, in the case of imports from EU countries, such additional labelling requirements could be regarded as infringing internal market rules relating to free movement of such goods. <\/p><p>  Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, it was clear that possession by an underage person of a labelled container would not in itself constitute proof that the alcohol in the container has been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appeared on the container.  The labelled container could have been taken from the family home or have been sold to a person over the age of 18 in good faith before being passed on to the person in possession of it.  Indeed a container might have changed hands several times before coming into possession of the underage person. <\/p><p>  The Group also noted that according to answers already given to parliamentary questions on the subject, issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container had been raised during discussions on implementation of the 2003 Act with the Office of the Attorney General.  That Office had expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container and the overall effectiveness of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act. <\/p><p>  For the reasons set out above, I do not intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act.  I am however prepared to give serious consideration in the context of the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill to any reasonable and workable labelling proposal that would not give rise to the difficulties outlined in the 2008 Report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Numbers","counter":2265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRX01150"},{"type":"question","counter":2266,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[20376\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of official Garda vehicles attached to Coolock Garda district in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2267,"content":"<p>Decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda vehicles are a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the context of his identified operational demands and in the light of available resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Garda vehicles attached to the Coolock District for the years requested by the Deputy was as outlined in the table below:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that an additional &euro;3 million was made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the end of last year which enabled the Force to procure a further 171 vehicles.

Extending these reliefs is not straightforward given that there is a requirement for EU State Aid approval for such measures.  The deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in budget 2012 to encourage inter-generational land transfers.<\/p><p>I am delighted that the number of applicants for Teagasc courses has greatly increased the last two years.

Furthermore, the introduction in 2012 of an on-line mapping element allowed farmers, or their agents, who needed to submit maps to my Department, to do so through iNet, thereby dispensing with the need to submit paper maps. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRY02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences Numbers","counter":2339,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRY02750"},{"type":"question","counter":2340,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[20132\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRY02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of current valid licences that are in issue from his Department for salmon cage installations in counties Mayo, Galway and Clare; if all of these licences are being actively used; the person responsible for the maintenance of salmon cages; if these cages\/installations are inspected by his Department's officials on a regular basis; if he will provide a copy of the conditions of these licences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1108","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2341,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s records indicate that there are 18 aquaculture licences in use for the cultivation of salmon in the areas referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  These licences are either in-date or subject to the provisions of Section 19A(4) of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act.

Fluoridation of public water supplies is provided for in the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies Act) 1960.

It concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. In 2011 the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), published its &lsquo;Opinion on critical review of any new evidence on the hazard profile, health effects, and human exposure to fluoride and the fluoridating agents of drinking water&rsquo;.

The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.

The Agency currently accepts a standard of 4 parts per million for naturally fluoridated water in the USA, which is 5 times higher than the levels for fluoridated water in Ireland. It should be noted that among those substances classed by the Agency in the same group as fluoride are common substances such as ethanol, ozone and chlorine dioxide as well as caffeine, which is found in tea and coffee and acrylamide, which is found in well browned toast and roast potatoes.<\/p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health has reviewed a number of studies over the years in relation to neurological effects. These studies have typically involved dosing laboratory rats with very high levels of fluoride. The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) review in 2011 referred to the Whitford study in which rats were given doses equivalent to 200 times the human exposure without demonstrating any neurological effects. <\/p><p>  A number of studies from China, and the systematic review of these by Choi (from the Harvard Medical School) which claim an effect on children's IQ at very high levels of naturally occurring fluoride, were assessed by the Expert Body in 2011 and were found to be of no relevance to Ireland, given our regulated fluoridation levels. The view of the Expert Body is that the overall design of the studies is poor and they do not provide evidence of any effect on children's IQ from either high or low fluoride levels. This view was shared by SCHER in its 2011 Review. It should be noted that the Deans of Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine have recently confirmed their support of water fluoridation as a safe public health measure for people of all ages. <\/p><p>  The Expert Body is satisfied that water fluoridation, at its optimal level, causes no ill effects.

I am not aware of any issues in relation to legislation introducing generic substitution in Canada.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill, passed Committee Stage on 19 March and is currently at Report Stage. Under the Bill, the Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.  In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:<\/p><p>  (a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group;<\/p><p>  (b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and<\/p><p>  (c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group.<\/p><p>In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where:<\/p><p> - there is a difference in bioavailability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them, and<\/p><p> - any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group.<\/p><p>  I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products the Board is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Bill and that these criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health\/HSE report 'Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution' (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill address the concerns raised in relation to the substitution of anti-epileptic drugs. I met with the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.

I assured them that my aim\u00a0is\u00a0to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making \u00a0the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.\u00a0\u00a0To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0 I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. \u00a0 I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups such as Longford Community Resources Ltd in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community. \u00a0However, given\u00a0 resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.\u00a0\u00a0 The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.<\/p><p>  Work has been underway over the last six months to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. This has involved consultations with the Department of the Environment, Community and\u00a0Local Government, the\u00a0County and\u00a0City\u00a0Managers Association and the rural Transport Network in the context of aligning the new structure with the local authority structure.<\/p><p>  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding\u00a0the County Longford area\u00a0or any other part of the country. I am awaiting proposals from the NTA when they have concluded their deliberations and discussions but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure\u00a0in the near future which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs. \u00a0 I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector. \u00a0Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRGG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":2696,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRGG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2697,"qnumday":607,"qnumall":"[19972\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRGG01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if the Secretary General of his Department, for the purpose of transparency and accountability, will publish their diary on their website on a monthly basis.","asker":"1103","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2698,"content":"<p>It is proposed to\u00a0publish\u00a0the Secretary General's diary\u00a0online for a number of months on a trial basis.\u00a0This initiative\u00a0will then be\u00a0reviewed in the light of whether there is any significant level of hits on the relevant page.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRGG01500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Semi-State Bodies Mergers","counter":2699,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRGG01550"},{"type":"question","counter":2700,"qnumday":608,"qnumall":"[19992\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000064#WRGG01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress made to date of the merger of the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency; the name of the amalgamated body; when he expects the merger to be complete; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2701,"content":"<p>The Government decided on 12th June 2012 to approve proposals for the merger of the National Roads Authority (NRA) and the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA).\u00a0 The General Scheme of a Bill to give legal effect to the merger was approved by Government on 21 February 2013.

This panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.<\/p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender advises the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrower&rsquo;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  <\/p><p>  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.<\/p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as required by borrowers.  The advisory framework is being monitored on an on-going basis and a full review of the service will be undertaken in June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.  I have had no meetings on this issue with the Professional Insurance Brokers Association to date. However, all interested organisations will have an opportunity to input to the review of the service in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000065#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":2752,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000065#WRN01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2753,"qnumday":304,"qnumall":"[19980\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000065#WRN02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the progress made to date in respect of an outstanding appeal for invalidity pension in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; when the matter will be brought to a conclusion; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2754,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 17th September 2012.

It is important to remember that control savings are not actual monies recovered by the Department but are a good indication of the increase in social welfare expenditure that would occur without these activities taking place.  Without this control work, social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount.  These activities also have a deterrent or knock-on effect, which are not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.<\/p><p>  Controls are exercised at both the initial claim stage and at subsequent stages during the claim life cycle. Claims are reviewed on a regular and targeted basis. Means-tested payments are reviewed at certain intervals or when there are indications that changes in circumstances have not been reported to the Department.

Customers in receipt of unemployment payments are checked on a regular basis to verify continued compliance with such requirements as being available for and genuinely seeking employment.<\/p><p>  Current measures to control fraud and abuse also include desk reviews of claim papers, home visits, the issue of mail-shots to selected customers, database checking and data matching with other organisations.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit focuses on planned and systematic control activity and projects.

The government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the gradual implementation of a guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided. <\/font>    Other relevant provision is made through the training and education programmes delivered through F&Aacute;S and the further education sector.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The size and the timescale for any additional provision that is both desirable and feasible, over and above that outlined above, will be established over the coming months.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">In this context, the Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a youth guarantee in Ireland. We have sought funding from the European Commission for a proposed pilot Youth Guarantee Scheme (YGS) in the Ballymun area of north Dublin, and numerous organisations (e.g. IBEC, Ballymun Job Centre, National Youth Council of Ireland) have agreed to participate in this pilot. We are currently waiting to hear from the European Commission as to whether or not our application has been successful. We have been informed that a final decision on our application will be made by the end of June.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Subject to approval from the Commission, the proposed Ballymun YGS pilot will look to develop an activation approach tailored to the needs of young people.  It is intended that the Ballymun pilot YGS will, in respect of the target group of young people, guarantee access to career guidance\/assistance leading to identification of an individual career plan for the young unemployed person with follow-through to training, education, work experience or full-time employment.  Depending on the needs of the young individual the steps in the career plan might include personal assessment, job search assistance, skills training, work experience internships, but the objective in all cases will be to lead the young person to employment placement or further education or training. A particular focus of the pilot YGS will be to involve, and build links with, employers in the locality and the immediate hinterland in order to ensure that the guidance and training elements of the YGS are tailored to the needs of the local labour market and also to generate work placement\/experience opportunities for the YGS participants.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000066#WRO01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":2791,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000066#WRO01250"},{"type":"question","counter":2792,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[20248\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000066#WRO01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the average waiting time, in the past twelve months for a review, in line with the relevant social welfare legislation, to be carried out by the Chief Appeals Officer, of appeals already decided by appeals officers.","asker":"1015","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2793,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the information sought by the Deputy is not available.<\/p><p>  Processing times in relation to appeals are measured and reported by an ICT system in the Appeals Office.

This was in keeping with the recommendations of Justice Quirke following the Peatlands Forum and with the motion agreed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 7th   of March.<\/p><p>  My Department has now engaged a team of specialists who are undertaking the necessary scientific work to underpin the National Plan and to inform the future restoration and management of each of the SACs. This work is being overseen by an independent steering group with input from the Peatlands Council. Draft proposals for each of the sites will be discussed with affected parties as part of this process. <\/p><p>  The detailed exploration of relocation sites is a key element in progressing the National Plan. In collaboration with the Peatlands Council, and with the assistance of Bord na M&oacute;na, my Department is actively engaging with turf cutting communities to consider how relocation can be progressed. <\/p><p>  The aim of my Department is to facilitate, as far as possible, those qualifying cutters who wish to continue to cut turf by putting in place relocation sites for as many cutters as possible in the shortest possible time. Given the complexities of the process it can take time to resolve all issues to finality even as new sites come on stream. The provision of financial payments or deliveries of turf is available to those awaiting relocation. My officials will continue to work with local groups on these issues within the principles of the relocation scheme.<\/p><p>  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made for groups from Clara Bog in County Offaly and from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog in County Galway. <\/p><p>  My Department also envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during this turf cutting season provided that final agreement is reached with relevant cutters.<\/p><p>  Of the remaining 49 raised bog SACs, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation.<\/p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na undertook a preliminary assessment of a potential relocation site for turf cutters on Coolrain Bog Special Area of Conservation on behalf of my Department. On the basis of this assessment, Bord na M&oacute;na has undertaken a stratigraphy assessment of this site in order to get a better indication of the quality and quantity of peat there. The stratigraphy report has recently been received by my Department. Officials from my Department will contact turf cutter representatives from Coolrain Bog shortly with a view to discussing the report and other relevant issues. <\/p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants from Coolrain Bog while awaiting relocation to a non-designated bog. <\/p><p>  The continuation of cutting on parts of any raised bog SAC,  such as Coolrain, may only be considered within the strict parameters of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive, which prescribe the circumstances under which potentially damaging activities can be consented to. In the context of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, it may be possible to bring some flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, that could allow limited cutting within a small number of sites, if there are no alternatives. <\/p><p>  I am determined that, in collaboration with the Peatlands Council and local turf-cutting communities, substantial progress will be made on the plan over the coming months. My Department has stepped up contact with turf-cutting groups to seek long-term solutions to the issues for their particular bogs, in compliance with EU and national law. I hope that the Plan can be completed by November, in time to submit an application to the European Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, if required, prior to the 2014 cutting season. <\/p><p>  However, the engagement and agreement of turf-cutting communities to its proposed approaches will be essential to meeting this timeline, and to unlocking the potential flexibility it offers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000067#WRP04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation Appeals","counter":2873,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2874,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[20381\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when an SAC appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) will take place; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":2875,"content":"<p>I understand that the appellant in question is one of a number for this site who have already opted for a Stage 2 formal hearing of their case before the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board.

There is potential for maximising synergies while addressing the possible trade-offs between competitiveness, security of supply and sustainability.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Commissioner Oettinger attended the Informal Meeting. He highlighted how any new framework should take into account current economic difficulties whilst remaining ambitious on the long-term low carbon objective.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The Council of Energy Ministers also discussed the effects of unconventional oil and gas on energy supply, competitiveness and prices.  In relation to the work currently underway by the European Commission on unconventional hydrocarbon extraction, the Irish Presidency requested that the Commission would reflect on the debate among Ministers in Dublin, particularly on the global competitiveness and security of supply aspects, and to take those views into consideration in their work on the matter, having regard to legitimate environmental and safety considerations.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The two days of discussions were informed by the goal of full implementation of the internal energy market.  Ministers agreed that this is not an end in itself, but rather, it must bring tangible benefits to all energy consumers.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">On the issue of the links between smart technology, innovation and energy policy, I concluded that the ultimate objective in rolling out standardised smart meters and smart grids across Europe must be value and benefit driven, with a specific consumer focus. In so doing, we must recognise the energy needs, circumstances and IT capabilities of all categories of consumers.  Data protection concerns should also be considered and addressed.  The need for public awareness campaigns on the potential advantages was acknowledged and the benefits must be clear to all individual energy customers and management of energy consumption.  Product and price analysis must be simple and straightforward.  Suppliers will also have a responsibility to build consumer trust given the huge volume on data in question.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The financing of energy efficiency measures was also discussed. Realising the energy efficiency potential of buildings is central to the EU's energy efficiency policy.  Nearly 40% of final energy is consumed in homes, offices and shops.  The challenge that faces Energy Ministers is to find the necessary finance to underpin the energy retrofit renovation that is required as part of our 2020 energy and climate goals.  This is particularly important given the potential for jobs and growth that a sustained campaign of energy efficiency in buildings would realise.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">At a thought provoking final session which considered the integration of variable renewable energy sources, in particular wind and solar energy, the Ministers agreed that the proper development of energy policy must adequately recognise the numerous challenges, including cost considerations, in the incremental transition to a low carbon economy.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I concluded the two day session by stating that in relation to all the energy matters considered by the Ministers, our level of ambition must be underpinned by a rigorous analysis of the costs and benefits associated with the different possible approaches to new and existing policies, especially in exploiting new opportunities.  National energy circumstances are also important, as we strive to reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I look forward to continuing discussions on identifying a robust 2030 framework which will facilitate long term European competitiveness and security of supply. Europe must maintain its leadership position in the transition to a low carbon future, particularly with regard to energy efficient and clean technology, products and services.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I should also highlight that the Council of Ministers agreed that I would write to President Van Rompuy to update him on our deliberations which the Ministers wish to see inputted to the forthcoming Council of Europe meeting in May.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries","counter":2890,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2891,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[19884\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of salmon that came through the fish counter on the Feale in County Kerry during the first three months of 2013 on a monthly basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":2892,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[19885\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"netmen of the Cashen caught 1509 Salmon in 2012, the number of salmon they caught in each of the months of June, July, August, that is what is the breakdown of the 1509 figure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":2893,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[19886\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"presently there are 49 commercial nets in the Cashen, if that figure has to be reduced, the piece of primary legislation that needs to be amended or is the decision to allow 49 nets addressed through Statutory Instrument S.I on a year by year basis and signed by the Minister of the day; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2894,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 to 357, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The River Feale counter is located approximately 5 kilometres downstream of Listowel Town in the townland of Scartleigh at the Kerry County Council water abstraction plant.<\/p><p>The counter is a one channel counter operated on a crump which was installed to assist fish over the large weir.  I am advised the counter works very well on this site.  However fish have been seen travelling over the weir outside of the fish pass in high water conditions so it is not a complete count but it counts the majority of the fish.<\/p><p>Table A below represents the number of fish that have traversed the counter for January, February and March of 2013. These figures are available from Inland Fisheries Ireland through the Limerick office.<\/p><p>Table B below represents the breakdown of 1,509 for the commercial catch for June, July and August 2012.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware the final 10kms of the course of the River Feale is known as the Cashen River and there are 49 public commercial draft net licences and 2 private commercial draft net licences on the River.  The number of licences available for draft net operations is set out in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order currently S.I. 75 of 2013.  This Order authorises the issue of commercial fishing licences by Inland Fisheries Ireland and sets out the criteria under which those licences may be issued and prescribes the maximum number of commercial licences that may be issued.<\/p><p>The mechanism for controlling the take of salmon by the commercial fishery is not by licence number but by quota.  Each year commercial fishermen apply for commercial licences and are assessed against criteria as set out in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order which gives priority to established fishermen with a recent history of fishing in the fishery.  All applications are put before the Board of Inland Fisheries Ireland for approval.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the Total Allowable Catch (quota set) determines the number of fish that can be harvested regardless of the number of licences in operation.  The Total Allowable Catch is the surplus available above the conservation limit for the river that can be harvested.  This allows for the sustainable exploitation of the river whilst conserving the required number of spawning fish for the system.<\/p><p>The surplus available for 2013 for the River Feale is 1,992 fish.  This quota is divided between the commercial fishermen and recreational anglers by the River Basin District Director following consultation with the Fisheries District Committee.  The quota is identified by the National Standing Committee for Salmon following assessment of all the relevant scientific data for the river in question including catch figures for the previous 5 years and any other relevant data.  This is set out in the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Scheme Regulations S.I. 556 2012 which sets the quota for the Feale including the Galey and Brick rivers at 1,992 for exploitation by commercial and rod and line licensed fishermen in 2013.<\/p><p><b>Table A - Fish Counter<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>2013 Month<\/th><th>Feale Counter Figure (Up Only)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>January<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>February<\/td><td>32<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>March<\/td><td>86<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total to date<\/td><td>135<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><b>Table B- Commercial Catch<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>2012 Month <\/th><th>Commercial Catch<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>June<\/td><td>221<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>July<\/td><td>1040<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August<\/td><td>248<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":2895,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":2896,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[19960\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if the Secretary General of his Department, for the purpose of transparency and accountability, will publish their diary on their website on a monthly basis.","asker":"1103","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2897,"content":"<p>I can confirm that arrangements will be put in place shortly to publish the diary of the Secretary General of my Department on the website of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":2898,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2899,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[20004\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000068#WRQ02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will identify all broadband blackspots in counties Longford and Westmeath.","asker":"1065","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2900,"content":"<p>The State can only intervene in the broadband market to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services.

International comparisons do not take account of high speed services at speeds up to and exceeding 1 gigabit per second which are contracted by heavy users of such service for use using leased lines or comparable links.  Furthermore, International comparison tables are based on marketed services which do not take account of actual accessibility to those speeds within any state nor do they take account of the actual customer experience which may differ from state to state.<\/p><p>  In Ireland high capacity broadband links over leased lines, which are capable of meeting the needs of heavy users including hospitals, schools, local authorities and third level educational institutions, are widely available.  However, as mentioned above, these services are not included in international comparisons.  In the case of post primary schools the Government has announced plans to equip all post primary schools with 100Mbps broadband.  This programme is continuing and all schools will be connected by the start of the 2014 academic year <\/p><p>  In the case of marketed broadband services, data reports published by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), reveal that the number of broadband subscribers has more than doubled in Ireland to over 1.6 million between 2007 and 2012.  Similarly, in the case of speeds, the number of residential customers contracted in a range between 2&ndash;10 megabits per second (Mbps) increased from 41% of all subscribers in 2007 to 71% in 2012.  The number of subscribers accessing speeds exceeding 10 Mbps increased from 0.2% to 24% in the same period.  95% of customers are therefore contracted at speeds of 2 Mbps or more compared to an EU average availability at 2 Mbps or more over fixed lines of 92%.<\/p><p>  In the case of comparing the fastest marketed speeds, the most recently published OECD data ranks Ireland 16th   fastest of more than 30 countries surveyed for fastest advertised retail broadband speed.<\/p><p>  Subject to the cautions expressed above about interpreting international comparison tables, it can be concluded that there has been significant growth in the take up of marketed retail broadband services and contracted speeds in Ireland in recent years and, in addition, high bandwidth is widely available in Ireland over leased lines.  The take up of basic broadband in Ireland at speeds of 2 Mbps or more compares favourably with similar accessibility as an EU average.  The availability of high speed services is also increasing rapidly with UPC now offering speeds of 150Mbps to almost 700,000 homes and Eircom preparing to launch new next generation fixed line services.  Mobile operators are also preparing to launch high speed 4G services following ComReg&rsquo;s successful conclusion of the multi band spectrum auction.  The Government has committed to ensuring that broadband speeds of at least 30Mbps are available in all parts of Ireland.  This will require intervention by the State in areas where there is no case for investment by the commercial market.  My Department is in the process of appointing consultants to assist in developing the necessary mapping, EU State Aids and procurement process for this intervention.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan (NBP) therefore anticipates that all parts of Ireland will have access to 30Mbps broadband well ahead of the EU target date of 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000069#WRR01600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":2934,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[20403\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000069#WRR01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which he has identified areas throughout the country known to be particularly problematic in respect of access to high-speed broadband; if he has examined a means where these issues can be addressed effectively in the short and medium term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2935,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  <\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.

My Department also provides funding to local authorities to support their efforts in this area.   <\/p><p>  While I currently have no plans to launch a national litter and illegal dumping awareness campaign on television and national radio, I have recently allocated &euro;900,000 to local authorities from Environment Fund under the 2013 Anti-Litter &amp;amp; Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grants Scheme.  My Department has co-funded these grants for local authority anti-litter awareness and education initiatives since 1997.  Under this scheme, local authorities are responsible for selecting suitable projects for funding and deciding on individual grant allocations.  The scheme requires that projects selected should promote greater public awareness and education in relation to both litter and graffiti.  They should also, where possible, focus on voluntary initiatives by community and environmental groups and involve schools and young people in anti-litter and anti-graffiti action.  Typically, eligible projects include local media campaigns, clean-ups, primary\/secondary school competitions, exhibitions and the production of videos, posters and leaflets.  The maximum grant for a project may be up to 70% of the cost, with the balance being met by local contributions. <\/p><p>  My Department has also taken several steps to combat the problem of small scale illegal dumping in recent times.  In summer 2012, I launched a national campaign in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency and supported by the print media, to highlight the economic value of our environment and encouraging the public to report all incidences of illegal dumping to the Agency's National Environmental Complaints hotline at 1850 365 121.

The Regulations will require that homeowners demonstrate significant pyritic damage in accordance with the recently published standard by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, I.S. 398 &ndash; Reactive Pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1.  This standard provides guidance on the building condition assessment, as well as on the sampling and testing to be carried out to establish the presence of significant pyritic damage.<\/p><p>  To be eligible for an exemption from the LPT, a homeowner must obtain a certificate, from a competent person, confirming the presence of significant pyritic damage on the basis of a building condition assessment in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 and having regard to the outcome of the testing and classification of the sub-floor hardcore material carried out in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013.  Eligibility for an exemption will be determined by reference to the presence of significant pyritic damage in the relevant property concerned.<\/p><p>  Conscious of the need to reduce costs to affected homeowners, provision is being made in the Regulations for the use, where feasible, of the results from testing of the sub-floor hardcore undertaken prior to the publication of I.S. 398-1:2013, to classify the hardcore material if the testing that has been carried out is in accordance with, or equivalent to, the test methods provided in I.S. 398-1:2013, and this has been validated as such by a competent person.<\/p><p>  A Building Condition Assessment in accordance with I.S. 398 will be required to be carried out by a competent person irrespective of when the testing is, or was, carried out.<\/p><p>  A homeowner cannot claim the exemption until the relevant certificate has been issued in respect of the residential property.  He or she should notify the Revenue Commissioners at that stage to claim the exemption.  Special arrangements will apply in respect of 2013 and 2014 to facilitate homeowners in claiming an exemption.  While homeowners who do not have the relevant certificate on the first liability date of 1 May 2013 (liability date for 2013), or by 1 November 2013 (liability date for 2014), will be required to pay LPT for those periods, they will be able to reclaim the tax paid if they obtain the certificate by 31 December 2013 and notify the Revenue Commissioners in writing on or before 31 January 2014.  As an alternative to such retrospective treatment they can opt to start the period of exemption from the liability date following the issue of the certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000073#WRV00900","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Collection","counter":3067,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000073#WRV00950"},{"type":"question","counter":3068,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[20430\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000073#WRV01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will outline on a local authority basis, the number of households which paid the property tax on a monthly basis since November 2012.","asker":"1015","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":3069,"content":"<p>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the Household Charge.

There are currently 35 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA, providing accommodation and ancillary services to 4,715 persons.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Direct Provision system remains a key pillar of the State's asylum and immigration system and I have no plans to end it.  I, and previous Ministers for Justice and Equality, have explained in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the normal structures dealing with homelessness could not cope when the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland increased dramatically, and how the Direct Provision system was the only realistic accommodation solution.  There are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.  In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. This was a key finding in the recent Value for Money Report on the direct provision system which was published in 2010 and is on the RIA website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie.<\/i>   I have also explained the nature of the full board accommodation system provided; how RIA coordinates through other Government bodies a number of ancillary services to residents; how residents are offered free medical screening on arrival in the State and have access to health services; and how residents have access to primary and secondary education services, on the same basis as Irish citizens.<\/p><p><br \/>  The practical effect of limiting the time spent by children spent in Direct Provision to six months is that the system itself becomes largely inoperable beyond that period for all residents. The alternative is the granting of the right to work and an extensive range of mainstreamed social and housing supports which, for the reasons given above, is not a realistic policy option.  That said, I have acknowledged that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process is an issue to be addressed.  The accommodation system is inextricably linked to the surrounding asylum process. The revised Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications. This work is being given high priority and applicants will be advised of the new arrangements as soon as possible. <\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the psychological needs of asylum seekers in direct provision, including their children, all such persons are entitled to the same level of medical - including psychological - care as persons residing in the general community. Asylum seekers are, by definition, a category of persons who arrived in this country seeking protection from harm.  They are disconnected from their home country, from family and from their social network. Decisions as to whether there needs to be specific research into the psychological needs of a particular set of children is ultimately a matter for the HSE to determine. In this context, it should be noted that the medical and psychological services provided to asylum seekers are at least on a par with those provided to the community generally. Some additional supports such as psychological supports focussed specifically on asylum seekers are also provided. Other organisations also provide supports locally and nationally, many of which (such as Spirasi's Centre for the Survivors of Torture) receive funding from the HSE.<\/p><p><br \/>  In this connection, it cannot be emphasised enough that RIA takes the issue of child welfare, and the protection of residents generally, very seriously. RIA has had a child protection policy, based on the HSE's Children First Policy, in place since 2006. There is a specific unit in RIA called the Child and Family Services Unit, which is fully staffed and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  It also acts as a conduit between RIA and the HSE, the latter having statutory functions in this area.  Moreover, all staff in centres must be Garda vetted and comply with RIA's child protection policy, a copy of which is available on its website - www.ria.gov.ie.  This is in furtherance of RIA's policy which has as its principal aim the minimisation of risk to children and vulnerable adults residing in its centres. <\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of an independent external enquiry into the direct provision system ,I have already indicated that it cannot be viewed separately from the overall asylum and immigration system which is ultimately a matter of Government policy subject to scrutiny and oversight by the Oireachtas. Over the years, the system has been open to scrutiny by many national and international bodies. Centres have been visited by various international bodies, including the UNHCR, the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner, by the Council of Europe European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), and others.  On 6 October, 2011, in Geneva  I appeared before the UN Human Rights Committee in connection with its scrutiny of Ireland under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Process . No recommendation was made in relation to the Direct Provision system in the Committee's subsequent UPR report on Ireland. <\/p><p><br \/>  The practical day to day operation of the system is,of course subject to inspection, including independent inspection.. All accommodation centres under contract to RIA are obliged to ensure that their premises comply with and operate in accordance with all relevant statutory requirements of local authorities in relation to planning, building, bye-laws, bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions, and general safety. Inspections of the direct provision centres are carried out by RIA inspectors, an external Inspectorate (QTS Ltd), plus other inspections for fire safety and food safety (EHO). As already cited, a comprehensive review on the operation of the asylum seeker accommodation programme was carried out and the subsequent report -  <i>&quot;Value for Money and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme&quot; -  <\/i>  was published in May 2010. A copy of this review is available on the RIA website at www.ria.gov.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000073#WRV03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":3099,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":3100,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[19968\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Secretary General of his Department, for the purpose of transparency and accountability, will publish their diary on their website on a monthly basis.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3101,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that there are currently no plans to publish the diary of the Secretary General on the Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Insolvency Act","counter":3102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRW00350"},{"type":"question","counter":3103,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[19979\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the professional qualifications and requirements that are required of a personal insolvency practitioner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":3104,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[20026\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRW00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the safeguards that exist to ensure that personal insolvency practitioners act in an independent manner, particularly in vuew of the fact that PIPs will be constantly dealing with the same creditor banks where familiarity may undermine independence.","asker":"959","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3105,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 431 and 437 together.<\/p><p>  The independent role played by Personal Involvency Practitioners (PIPs) will be critical to the success of the new debt solutions under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  A PIP will have to be free from any undue influence, guidance or control by any other person that could prevent or hinder their performance of their functions under the Act.  Therefore it is important that we provide a strong regulatory framework that will cover the control and supervision of individuals who will provide services under the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act.<\/p><p>  All PIPs will be authorised and regulated by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, in accordance with Part 5 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 - Sections 159 to 169.  In Part 5 of the Act, Section 163 sets out how an individual may make application to carry on practice as a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, and Section 164 the matters which the Insolvency Service must take into account in deciding whether an applicant should be authorised as a PIP or whether authorisation is to be refused. <\/p><p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland will shortly publish the Regulations under Section 161 of the Act in regard to the authorisation and regulation of personal insolvency practitioners.  The Regulations will set out the necessary criteria in regard to qualifications.  As I have previously stated, I expect that accountants, lawyers and a broad range of financial advisors may wish to seek regulation as practitioners, but it will not be confined to these professions.  The qualifying criteria for becoming a practitioner will be rigorous and will be based on a series of important considerations such as educational and professional qualifications, relevant knowledge and experience, and the completion of a course of study - by passing an exam - on the laws and practice generally, as they apply in the State, in relation to the insolvency of individuals and knowledge of the Act.  Applicants will also have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Insolvency Service that they are fit and proper persons, that they are financially sound, and that they have the organisational capability and the resources to carry on the practice of being a practitioner.  They will have to hold professional indemnity insurance as well as being tax compliant. <\/p><p>  Where a person has concerns that improper conduct by a PIP has occurred or is occurring, they may make a complaint in writing to the Insolvency Service.  The Act provides that the Insolvency Service, following receipt of a complaint, or of its own volition, may investigate any improper conduct by a PIP.  This may result in the suspension or revocation of the authorisation of the personal insolvency practitioner or the imposition of sanctions in accordance with the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRW00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Peace Commissioners","counter":3106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRW00650"},{"type":"question","counter":3107,"qnumday":432,"qnumall":"[19995\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRW00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide the full list of active and currently serving Peace Commissioners in an area (details supplied) in County Wicklow; the date of each of their appointments by him and his predecessors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3108,"content":"<p>My officials are collating the information which will be forwarded to the Deputy in the coming days.<b><font color=\"#000080\">   <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRW00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":3109,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRW00850"},{"type":"question","counter":3110,"qnumday":433,"qnumall":"[20007\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress made to date in determination of eligibility for residency in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3111,"content":"<p>The person concerned is a failed asylum applicant.

Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions but the decision is solely at the discretion of the Judge who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.<\/p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy I have had enquiries made and I am informed that the position is that where a person is convicted of an offence which incurs penalty points, the award of penalty points is automatic under the legislation and the court has no discretion in the matter.  However, convictions are not incurred by persons who are required by the court to make a payment to the poor box.  <br \/>  The Deputy has referred to section 63 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 but an offence under that section does not attract penalty points.  The table below shows the number of defendants who were before the court in 2012 and to date this year for offences that incur penalty points in which the outcome involved a payment to the poor box.

The Commission recognised both the negative and positive aspects of the court use of the poor box and accordingly recommended that the court poor box be replaced by a statutory reparation fund.  A key element of the LRC recommendation was that the reparation fund should be ringfenced and used to assist programmes aimed at preventing offending behaviour and for the purpose of assisting victims of crime.  The Commission was of the view that the reparation fund should remain linked to the criminal justice process and thus broadly adhere to the principles of restorative justice.  I intend to bring forward legislation in due course to replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system.  In the context of that legislation, the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to the court poor box are being examined by my Department with a view to bringing forward proposals for a transparent statutory reparation scheme.  <b>  <\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRX00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Legislation","counter":3153,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRX00350"},{"type":"question","counter":3154,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[20334\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRX00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the relevant stakeholders who are currently being included in the Operational Working Group that is currently being established which will discuss and deal with issues arising from road traffic legislation, including any difficulties regarding the implementation of section 22 of the Road Traffic Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3155,"content":"<p>Following consultation between my Department, the Department of Transport and the Courts Service, an internal group is being established, the specific purpose of which is to review and address operational issues arising from the implementation of road traffic legislation.

Section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 was repealed by section 3(e) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. <\/p><p>  Section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, which replaced section 17 of the 2000 Act, provides for the making of regulations specifying particulars to be affixed to containers in which  intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off licensed premises which would enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified.  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered the feasibility of such regulations in its 2008 Report.  The Group noted that while the labelling of alcohol containers was an attractive idea, significant challenges would need to be overcome in order to render it effective in practice.  These challenges arose under two headings.<\/p><p>  Firstly, practical difficulties would arise at retail level in cases where several individual containers were packaged together for sale, e.g. an enclosed six-pack of bottles; a plastic-wrapped tray of cans; or a wooden box containing bottles of wine.  This raised the question of whether an appropriate label could be attached earlier in the supply or distribution chains rather than at the point of sale.  The Group noted that attaching such labels to containers at an earlier stage might be simpler but it could create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors.  Moreover, in the case of imports from EU countries, such additional labelling requirements could be regarded as infringing internal market rules relating to free movement of such goods. <\/p><p>  Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, it was clear that possession by an underage person of a labelled container would not in itself constitute proof that the alcohol in the container has been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appeared on the container.  The labelled container could have been taken from the family home or have been sold to a person over the age of 18 in good faith before being passed on to the person in possession of it.  Indeed a container might have changed hands several times before coming into possession of the underage person. <\/p><p>  The Group also noted that according to answers already given to parliamentary questions on the subject, issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container had been raised during discussions on implementation of the 2003 Act with the Office of the Attorney General.  That Office had expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container and the overall effectiveness of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act. <\/p><p>  For the reasons set out above, I do not intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act.  I am however prepared to give serious consideration in the context of the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill to any reasonable and workable labelling proposal that would not give rise to the difficulties outlined in the 2008 Report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Numbers","counter":3165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRX01150"},{"type":"question","counter":3166,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[20376\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of official Garda vehicles attached to Coolock Garda district in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3167,"content":"<p>Decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda vehicles are a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the context of his identified operational demands and in the light of available resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Garda vehicles attached to the Coolock District for the years requested by the Deputy was as outlined in the table below:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that an additional &euro;3 million was made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the end of last year which enabled the Force to procure a further 171 vehicles.

I have been working to encourage more new entrants to take up farming as a career.  Budget 2013 saw the extension of key reliefs that were already in place for young new entrants (such as the 100% relief from Stamp Duty and the 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers).  Extending these reliefs is not straightforward given that there is a requirement for EU State Aid approval for such measures.  The deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in budget 2012 to encourage inter-generational land transfers.<\/p><p>I am delighted that the number of applicants for Teagasc courses has greatly increased the last two years.  Teagasc has responded well to this demand and have introduced new courses to cater for a variety of needs.  For example Teagasc launched a new Professional Diploma in Dairy Farm Management (Level 7) in association with University College Dublin (UCD). Teagasc have also developed recently a new<i><\/i>  Level 6 Specific Purpose Certificate in Farm Administration course to help meet the training requirements for full-time or part-time farmers. <\/p><p><br \/>  It should be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). This means that farms worth up to &euro;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.<\/p><p><br \/>  Measures to provide targeted support to young farmers are part of the current negotiations on the reform of the CAP and will I hope form part of any final agreement.  I have strongly supported the proposal for a top-up for young farmers under pillar 1 of the CAP, and indeed Ireland was one of the first countries to suggest this measure in the negotiations.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am also happy that the new restructuring relief was announced in the2013 budget.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land. An EU Commission study found that '<i>younger[farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force<\/i>'<sup> [[1]<\/sup>  Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, CAP towards 2020, <i>Annex 1: Situation and prospects for EU agriculture and rural areas<\/i>  , p. 25.

Only 0.4% of land changes hand in any given year.  Young farmers that want to expand need to be able to access land.  According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.  Young farmers will now have an opportunity to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I am hopeful therefore that the measures that I have introduced will encourage more young people into farming and address the age profile imbalance in Irish farming.<\/p><p><sup>[1]<\/sup>  Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, CAP towards 2020, <i>Annex 1: Situation and prospects for EU agriculture and rural areas<\/i>  , p. 25.

It will be recalled that my successful approach to Commissioner Ciolos for agreement to making an advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment was prompted by the very wet weather experienced throughout last summer. The effects of this prolonged wet weather, together with the extended winter, have led ultimately to the current fodder crisis. <\/p><p>  In light of the difficulties experienced by farmers in sourcing fodder supplies, last week I announced the allocation of &euro;1 million to fund the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme, which is designed to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage (hay, silage, haylage) from outside the island of Ireland. This will substantially cover the cost of transport into the country and will reduce the cost to farmers of a bale of hay by approximately one third.<\/p><p>  Mindful of ongoing difficulties, a formal request will be made to the EU Commission  seeking agreement to pay an advance from 16 October of the 2013 Single Farm Payment which, at almost 2 months ahead of the standard timeline, is the earliest potential payment date.  <\/p><p>  In order to ensure that payments are processed efficiently and effectively, I would urge those who have yet to submit their applications under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme to do so via iNet, my Department&rsquo;s on-line application system, as there are significant benefits in doing so, not least of which is that it guaranteed immediate, verifiable receipt by my Department of their applications and, through the system of in-built validations, significantly reduces the numbers of errors that could be made, thereby ultimately leading to speedier payment. Furthermore, the introduction in 2012 of an on-line mapping element allowed farmers, or their agents, who needed to submit maps to my Department, to do so through iNet, thereby dispensing with the need to submit paper maps. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRY02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences Numbers","counter":3239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRY02750"},{"type":"question","counter":3240,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[20132\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRY02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of current valid licences that are in issue from his Department for salmon cage installations in counties Mayo, Galway and Clare; if all of these licences are being actively used; the person responsible for the maintenance of salmon cages; if these cages\/installations are inspected by his Department's officials on a regular basis; if he will provide a copy of the conditions of these licences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1108","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3241,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s records indicate that there are 18 aquaculture licences in use for the cultivation of salmon in the areas referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  These licences are either in-date or subject to the provisions of Section 19A(4) of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act.

The provisions of the proposed Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013 will amend the Adoption Act 2010 to provide for the non-voluntary adoption of a child where his or her parents have failed in their duty towards that child.  The draft Bill will change the criteria, applicable under section 54 of the 2010 Act, under which the High Court may authorise the making of an adoption order without parental consent, in the case of a child who is in the care of prospective adopters and where that child&rsquo;s parents have failed in their parental duty to the child. The proposed legislation is not intended to provide that a child, who has contact with and a strong beneficial relationship with his or her birth parents and wider family, may be adopted unless that child's parents have voluntarily placed the child for adoption and have consented to the adoption order being made in respect of the child. <\/p><p>  The draft Bill will also provide for the voluntary placement for adoption of any child irrespective of the marital status of his or her parents.

The main conclusions of the SCHER report are that there are no known health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU. <\/p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters. It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries. The Expert Body keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRAA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":3349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRBB00050"},{"type":"question","counter":3350,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[20538\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRBB00100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if recognition is to be provided to creative arts therapies and if it is intended to include the Irish Association of Creative Arts Therapists under the provisions of the Health and Social Social Care Professionals Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3351,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[20646\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is considering including creative art therapists under the registration of persons qualifying for the use and title of a designated profession for the determination of complaints relation to their fitness to practice under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3352,"qnumday":585,"qnumall":"[20372\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on statutory recognition and registration of creative arts therapies here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3353,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 515, 516 and 585 together.<\/p><p>  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council (HSCPC) and the 12 registration boards to be established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 - the Act - are responsible for protecting the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants of the following 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act: clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  In time, only registrants will be entitled to use these titles. The Council - also known as CORU - was established in March 2007 and is working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 designated professions.  The first registration board to be established, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt and processing of applications on 31 May, 2011.  A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16 December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established on 30 June 2013.  Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board,  the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board have been established with effect from 1 November 2012.  It is  proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board shortly and expressions of interest from interested parties are currently being sought through the Public Appointments Service to fill vacancies on the soon to be established Board.  All the registration boards and their registers for the remaining designated professions should be established by 2015.<\/p><p>  While the legislation empowers the Minister for Health to include, if he considers it appropriate and in the public interest to do so, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, and under specific criteria, I have no plans at present to regulate creative arts therapists.  The question of regulating further health and social care professionals may be reviewed post 2015 in the context of progress made by CORU at that juncture.  The issue of recognition of creative arts therapies in the public health services, the need for such services and the direct employment of creative arts therapists are matters for the Health Service Executive in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRBB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":3354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRBB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":3355,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[19726\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRBB00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Offaly will be facilitated at the dialysis clinic in Tullamore, County Offaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3356,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":3357,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":3358,"qnumday":518,"qnumall":"[19727\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an application for a E112 will be processed in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Offaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3359,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The Agency currently accepts a standard of 4 parts per million for naturally fluoridated water in the USA, which is 5 times higher than the levels for fluoridated water in Ireland. It should be noted that among those substances classed by the Agency in the same group as fluoride are common substances such as ethanol, ozone and chlorine dioxide as well as caffeine, which is found in tea and coffee and acrylamide, which is found in well browned toast and roast potatoes.<\/p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health has reviewed a number of studies over the years in relation to neurological effects. These studies have typically involved dosing laboratory rats with very high levels of fluoride. The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) review in 2011 referred to the Whitford study in which rats were given doses equivalent to 200 times the human exposure without demonstrating any neurological effects. <\/p><p>  A number of studies from China, and the systematic review of these by Choi (from the Harvard Medical School) which claim an effect on children's IQ at very high levels of naturally occurring fluoride, were assessed by the Expert Body in 2011 and were found to be of no relevance to Ireland, given our regulated fluoridation levels. The view of the Expert Body is that the overall design of the studies is poor and they do not provide evidence of any effect on children's IQ from either high or low fluoride levels. This view was shared by SCHER in its 2011 Review. It should be noted that the Deans of Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine have recently confirmed their support of water fluoridation as a safe public health measure for people of all ages. <\/p><p>  The Expert Body is satisfied that water fluoridation, at its optimal level, causes no ill effects.

In addition, the Irish Medicines Board has reviewed the policy on interchangeability of anti-epileptic drugs of a number of countries, including, Denmark, Sweden, the UK, and the Netherlands. I am not aware of any issues in relation to legislation introducing generic substitution in Canada.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill, passed Committee Stage on 19 March and is currently at Report Stage. Under the Bill, the Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.  In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:<\/p><p>  (a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group;<\/p><p>  (b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and<\/p><p>  (c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group.<\/p><p>In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where:<\/p><p> - there is a difference in bioavailability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them, and<\/p><p> - any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group.<\/p><p>  I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products the Board is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Bill and that these criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health\/HSE report 'Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution' (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill address the concerns raised in relation to the substitution of anti-epileptic drugs. I met with the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRFF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services Waiting Lists","counter":3558,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRFF01550"},{"type":"question","counter":3559,"qnumday":590,"qnumall":"[20513\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000074#WRFF01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure that a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath is given an orthodontist appointment as soon as possible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3560,"content":"<p>The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to patients based on their level of clinical need.

This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.\u00a0\u00a0To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0 I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. \u00a0 I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups such as Longford Community Resources Ltd in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community. \u00a0However, given\u00a0 resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.\u00a0\u00a0 The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.

The Commission was of the view that the reparation fund should remain linked to the criminal justice process and thus broadly adhere to the principles of restorative justice.

This raised the question of whether an appropriate label could be attached earlier in the supply or distribution chains rather than at the point of sale.  The Group noted that attaching such labels to containers at an earlier stage might be simpler but it could create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors.  Moreover, in the case of imports from EU countries, such additional labelling requirements could be regarded as infringing internal market rules relating to free movement of such goods. <\/p><p>  Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, it was clear that possession by an underage person of a labelled container would not in itself constitute proof that the alcohol in the container has been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appeared on the container.  The labelled container could have been taken from the family home or have been sold to a person over the age of 18 in good faith before being passed on to the person in possession of it.  Indeed a container might have changed hands several times before coming into possession of the underage person. <\/p><p>  The Group also noted that according to answers already given to parliamentary questions on the subject, issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container had been raised during discussions on implementation of the 2003 Act with the Office of the Attorney General.  That Office had expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container and the overall effectiveness of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act. <\/p><p>  For the reasons set out above, I do not intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act.  I am however prepared to give serious consideration in the context of the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill to any reasonable and workable labelling proposal that would not give rise to the difficulties outlined in the 2008 Report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000075#WRX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Numbers","counter":3640,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000075#WRX01150"},{"type":"question","counter":3641,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[20376\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000075#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of official Garda vehicles attached to Coolock Garda district in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3642,"content":"<p>Decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda vehicles are a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the context of his identified operational demands and in the light of available resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Garda vehicles attached to the Coolock District for the years requested by the Deputy was as outlined in the table below:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that an additional &euro;3 million was made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the end of last year which enabled the Force to procure a further 171 vehicles.

I have been working to encourage more new entrants to take up farming as a career.  Budget 2013 saw the extension of key reliefs that were already in place for young new entrants (such as the 100% relief from Stamp Duty and the 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers).  Extending these reliefs is not straightforward given that there is a requirement for EU State Aid approval for such measures.  The deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in budget 2012 to encourage inter-generational land transfers.<\/p><p>I am delighted that the number of applicants for Teagasc courses has greatly increased the last two years.  Teagasc has responded well to this demand and have introduced new courses to cater for a variety of needs.  For example Teagasc launched a new Professional Diploma in Dairy Farm Management (Level 7) in association with University College Dublin (UCD). Teagasc have also developed recently a new<i><\/i>  Level 6 Specific Purpose Certificate in Farm Administration course to help meet the training requirements for full-time or part-time farmers. <\/p><p><br \/>  It should be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). This means that farms worth up to &euro;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.<\/p><p><br \/>  Measures to provide targeted support to young farmers are part of the current negotiations on the reform of the CAP and will I hope form part of any final agreement.  I have strongly supported the proposal for a top-up for young farmers under pillar 1 of the CAP, and indeed Ireland was one of the first countries to suggest this measure in the negotiations.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am also happy that the new restructuring relief was announced in the2013 budget.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land.

According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.  Young farmers will now have an opportunity to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I am hopeful therefore that the measures that I have introduced will encourage more young people into farming and address the age profile imbalance in Irish farming.<\/p><p><sup>[1]<\/sup>  Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, CAP towards 2020, <i>Annex 1: Situation and prospects for EU agriculture and rural areas<\/i>  , p. 25.

Fluoridation of public water supplies is provided for in the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies Act) 1960. The policy of water was reviewed by the Forum on Fluoridation, which published its report in 2002. It concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. In 2011 the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), published its &lsquo;Opinion on critical review of any new evidence on the hazard profile, health effects, and human exposure to fluoride and the fluoridating agents of drinking water&rsquo;.

The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.

The Agency currently accepts a standard of 4 parts per million for naturally fluoridated water in the USA, which is 5 times higher than the levels for fluoridated water in Ireland. It should be noted that among those substances classed by the Agency in the same group as fluoride are common substances such as ethanol, ozone and chlorine dioxide as well as caffeine, which is found in tea and coffee and acrylamide, which is found in well browned toast and roast potatoes.<\/p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health has reviewed a number of studies over the years in relation to neurological effects. These studies have typically involved dosing laboratory rats with very high levels of fluoride. The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) review in 2011 referred to the Whitford study in which rats were given doses equivalent to 200 times the human exposure without demonstrating any neurological effects. <\/p><p>  A number of studies from China, and the systematic review of these by Choi (from the Harvard Medical School) which claim an effect on children's IQ at very high levels of naturally occurring fluoride, were assessed by the Expert Body in 2011 and were found to be of no relevance to Ireland, given our regulated fluoridation levels. The view of the Expert Body is that the overall design of the studies is poor and they do not provide evidence of any effect on children's IQ from either high or low fluoride levels. This view was shared by SCHER in its 2011 Review. It should be noted that the Deans of Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine have recently confirmed their support of water fluoridation as a safe public health measure for people of all ages. <\/p><p>  The Expert Body is satisfied that water fluoridation, at its optimal level, causes no ill effects.

I am not aware of any issues in relation to legislation introducing generic substitution in Canada.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill, passed Committee Stage on 19 March and is currently at Report Stage. Under the Bill, the Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.  In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:<\/p><p>  (a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group;<\/p><p>  (b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and<\/p><p>  (c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group.<\/p><p>In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where:<\/p><p> - there is a difference in bioavailability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them, and<\/p><p> - any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group.<\/p><p>  I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products the Board is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Bill and that these criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health\/HSE report 'Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution' (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill address the concerns raised in relation to the substitution of anti-epileptic drugs. I met with the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine.

I assured them that my aim\u00a0is\u00a0to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making \u00a0the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.\u00a0\u00a0To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0 I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. \u00a0 I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups such as Longford Community Resources Ltd in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community. \u00a0However, given\u00a0 resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.\u00a0\u00a0 The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.<\/p><p>  Work has been underway over the last six months to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. This has involved consultations with the Department of the Environment, Community and\u00a0Local Government, the\u00a0County and\u00a0City\u00a0Managers Association and the rural Transport Network in the context of aligning the new structure with the local authority structure.<\/p><p>  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken regarding\u00a0the County Longford area\u00a0or any other part of the country. I am awaiting proposals from the NTA when they have concluded their deliberations and discussions but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure\u00a0in the near future which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs. \u00a0 I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector. \u00a0Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000084#WRGG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":4071,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000084#WRGG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":4072,"qnumday":607,"qnumall":"[19972\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000084#WRGG01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if the Secretary General of his Department, for the purpose of transparency and accountability, will publish their diary on their website on a monthly basis.","asker":"1103","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":4073,"content":"<p>It is proposed to\u00a0publish\u00a0the Secretary General's diary\u00a0online for a number of months on a trial basis.\u00a0This initiative\u00a0will then be\u00a0reviewed in the light of whether there is any significant level of hits on the relevant page.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000084#WRGG01500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Semi-State Bodies Mergers","counter":4074,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000084#WRGG01550"},{"type":"question","counter":4075,"qnumday":608,"qnumall":"[19992\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013043000084#WRGG01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress made to date of the merger of the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency; the name of the amalgamated body; when he expects the merger to be complete; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":4076,"content":"<p>The Government decided on 12th June 2012 to approve proposals for the merger of the National Roads Authority (NRA) and the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA).\u00a0 The General Scheme of a Bill to give legal effect to the merger was approved by Government on 21 February 2013.
