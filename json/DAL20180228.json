I agree that the estate is of high scenic value and the combination of the mountains, the lake and the woodland are particularly attractive.  Its wild aspect so close to a major city also adds to its significance.  It is an important example of a hunting and fishing lodge where the emphasis was more on short term accommodation rather than formal reception rooms.  It is a particularly striking house for its 20th century cultural connections which are both tangible and intangible.

This right runs throughout people&rsquo;s lives, irrespective of where they come from, where they live, their religious beliefs or their economic or social backgrounds.  In line with these policy objectives, my Department's Creative Ireland programme continues to promote the Traveller mentoring programme and in 2017, through Cork City Council, funded the renovation of the Traveller culture exhibition at Cork Public Museum in 2017, with the refurbishment designed by visual artist and Traveller, Leanne McDonagh.<\/p><p>In 2017 the Irish Film Board and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, provided &euro;625,000 in funding for Carmel Winters' film, &quot;Float Like a Butterfly&quot;, which is due for release this year and is set among the Traveller community.

In 2010 it\u00a0was estimated that the cultural and creative industries contributed around 2.6% of the total GDP of the European Union, providing around 5 million jobs across the 27 EU member states.

I commend the front-line services on their work to date.  In particular, I commend Se&aacute;n Hogan and his team on the national co-ordination efforts.  I also pay tribute to Met &Eacute;ireann for the precision of its work.  I thank the media for broadcasting the guidance to people throughout the country.  I would like to refer to some aspects of this weather event.  At moments like this, we have to be particularly conscious of older people and families in poverty.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach was dismissive of calls to double the free fuel allowance for this week.  He said he could not \"offer a blank cheque\".  I am glad the Government has undertaken a U-turn on this issue.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has announced that the allowance will be doubled.  It is worrying that the issue was not anticipated earlier in the week.  We know that on occasions like this, cold weather and deep freezes can affect the elderly most of all.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Government to consider advancing additional financial supports to non-governmental organisations that are dealing with the homeless and with families in poverty.  In a week when the latest figures from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government show that more than 9,000 people, including 3,267 children, are homeless, which is a record number, it is incumbent on the Government to support organisations like the Peter McVerry Trust, the Simon Community and Focus Ireland that are working on the streets to bring the homeless in.  Heroic efforts are being made.  I have just listened to Pat Doyle of the Peter McVerry Trust saying that 81 homeless people were taken into a sports hall on the south side of Dublin yesterday to give them shelter on a very cold evening.  Additional supports should be given to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other organisations to keep an eye out for families who are in particular poverty and need for various reasons and will require support.<\/p>  <p>  I am surprised that decisions regarding school closures are being left to boards of management at local level.  I think there was similar indecision in relation to schools in advance of Storm Ophelia.  I mean it constructively when I say I think schools should close automatically when red alert warnings are issued.  It was confirmed this morning that school transport will not be operational in red alert areas.  That should mean de facto that schools should close.  If that happened, we would reduce the risk of accidents and traffic congestion.  Above all, it would represent an optimal approach to the safety of schoolchildren.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider doing that now.  With regard to public transport, will he give us strong reassurances that local councils have the equipment and the wherewithal to keep the main arteries open and to keep cities going and operational?  Although this is a matter for another day, it is worth reflecting that the entire country is coming to a halt, despite all the warnings, after one evening's snow so far.  We need to learn from other countries that experience far worse events than this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800012#K00900","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1519819200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>The national emergency co-ordination group is meeting as we speak.

The Government is leaving the decision on whether to close schools up to individual principals.  In my view, this is not the optimal way to protect schoolchildren and prevent traffic congestion.  We all know how long it took to get to work in Dublin this morning.  There are schools at which only 100 pupils turning up and many have less than full numbers.  This is a serious issue.

We have only had sight of the text in the past 45 minutes and we will have to study the precise detail in the coming hours.  However, having scanned the draft document, I welcome that the European Union now explicitly accepts that special arrangements are required for the North.  As the Taoiseach knows, since the Brexit referendum, Sinn F&eacute;in has argued consistently and vigorously for the North to be designated special status within the European Union.  We stated this was the only way to avoid the imposition of a hard border on this island and ensure the all-island economy and peace agreements are protected.  Special status means the North remaining inside the customs union and Single Market.  We now have a draft text that recognises that the North must stay in the customs union and I welcome that recognition.  I also voice concern at any prospect of the North exiting the Single Market and concerns remain for east-west trade and commerce.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach knows, the British Government and Brexiteers engaged in their Brexit debate with zero regard for the impact on Ireland.  They showed no concern for our economy, the rights of our people or the peace process.  They now want to conclude their debate and make their exit by putting the Good Friday Agreement through the shredder.  The Tory-DUP axis is satisfied to treat the welfare of the people of this island as collateral damage so long as it can achieve a little Englander Brexit.  Its arrogance is best highlighted by the rejection of the vote of the people of the North to remain in the European Union and crystallised most recently in the juvenile and dangerous commentary of the British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson.<\/p>  <p>  The DUP has explicitly hitched itself to the Tory wagon.  It has put narrow political interests ahead of the good of the people of the North from all communities, our economic well-being and the political process.  The position of the Tory-DUP Brexiteers is that they want Brexit at any cost.  However, they will not foot the bill.  Rather, it will be the ordinary people of this island, North and South, who foot the bill and that cannot be allowed to happen.  The Tory-DUP wrecking agenda cannot prevail.  As Head of Government, it is the Taoiseach's job to ensure this does not happen.  There is no doubt in my mind that the British Government will attempt to undermine the text of the draft agreement in the time ahead.  In the context of the DUP's collapsing of the talks in the North, I asked that the Taoiseach convene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  Today's development adds weight to the need for this to be done.  Will the Taoiseach convene the intergovernmental conference?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800013#L01300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1519819800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>The intergovernmental conference can be convened only at a date that is agreed by both the British and Irish Governments and such a date has not yet been agreed.  That is not to say that we are not in regular contact, however.  I have spoken twice on the telephone to Prime Minister May in the past ten days and we have also met in person.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise the constructive and measured approach taken by the Deputy's party to the Brexit issue in recent months.  What we have seen today is the publication of the draft withdrawal agreement by the European Commission.  The first thing the Government sought at the time of the Brexit referendum was a commitment from the UK Government that there would be no hard border and that eventuality would be avoided.  We got such a verbal commitment some time ago under the leadership of my forebear, Deputy Enda Kenny.  In December, we sought to have this commitment turned into a commitment in a political agreement and it was written down in black and white in the December text.  Most reasonable people will now accept, even though others said otherwise, that it was not over-hyped or oversold.  People will see the reality of that today in a legal text, a protocol to the draft withdrawal agreement, that sets out exactly in black and white how we can avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and how we can enforce that legally.  That has been done and the text has been published today.  A briefing will be available later today for Opposition leaders and spokespersons if they wish to have one.<\/p>  <p>  It is not the case that this is the only option.  This is the backstop and last resort, as Prime Minister May describes it.  There are alternative solutions.  The alternative solution is option A, which is our preferred option and the preferred option of the British Government, that involves us avoiding not just a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland but also a hard border between Britain and Ireland.  I do not want a border between Letterkenny and Derry any more than I want a border between Larne and Stranraer or Liverpool and Dublin.  We want people and trade to be able to move freely.  Option A is still an option.  It is now incumbent on the United Kingdom Government, in particular, to put forward detailed proposals on how it can be achieved or put forward the detail of option B.  <\/p><p>The Deputy is correct that hard line Brexiteers and some politicians in Northern Ireland will say \"No\" and will be angry at what they see today but just saying \"No\" and being angry is not enough.  If people do not like what they see today, it is incumbent on them to come up with alternative solutions and to flesh out option A and option B, write it down in a legal form that can be enforced and then we can negotiate on that.  We have between now and October to make those decisions.<\/p> <p> With regard to the different messages that may be coming from UK Government, when I want to know what it thinks, I listen to Prime Minister May.  I have spoken to her on three occasions in the past ten days.  She tells me that her government stands by its commitment to avoid a hard border and it is steadfast in its support for the Good Friday Agreement.  I trust Prime Minister May on both of those counts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800013#L01400","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519820400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach will recognise, as I do, that the rhetoric has changed for the worst substantially since last December and that the commitment made initially to no hard border and to protecting the agreement in all its parts has come unstuck because the reality is that members of the Tory Government are openly speculating that the agreement is past its sell-by date and that a hard border is not only necessary but, indeed, desirable to achieve the kind of Brexit they require.

The worst of Storm Emma and the Siberian wind is yet to hit.  While people are out and about today and at work, it is likely that from tonight they will be confined to their homes for some days to come.  That is, of course, those who have a home.  The homelessness figures for January were published yesterday.  Following a brief drop in December, the figures have continued to increase.  There are currently 9,104 people homeless in Ireland.  They comprise 5,837 adults and a record 3,267 children who are relying on emergency accommodation.  It is a sad reflection of our Government that the best excuse the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government could offer was that the extent of the increase was not anticipated.  Over the past week, the Government has been focused on spending &euro;1.5 million on propaganda to promote investment in a ten-year national development plan while more than 9,000 of our citizens are without a roof over their heads to call their own.  These are real people and real lives are being impacted by this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Research by Focus Ireland published last November demonstrated the impact the crisis is having on children.  The deep negative effect on their emotional and mental health has been documented and the statement yesterday by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, that babies living in hotels are not reaching their development milestones is a shocking indictment of a failed policy.  The State will have to deal with the repercussions of this for a generation.  Rebuilding Ireland is not delivering the homes needed.  The Minister has asked the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to investigate the matter and to prepare a detailed report but that will not help a single family.  The problem is not enough social housing is being built and there is no co-ordinated effort to rapidly bring vacant housing back into use while there is no security of tenure for tenants as landlords seek to raise rents, refurbish or sell their properties.  Despite commitments by the then Minister to end the use of emergency accommodation by last July, it remains the first port of call.  It is an outrage in a modern, developed, wealthy country, such as Ireland, that more than 3,000 of our children are homeless.  Figures provided to me yesterday show that a total of 1,517 families were using emergency accommodation during January but, that month, 700 homeless families were recorded as staying in hotels and bed and breakfasts in the Dublin region, with 385 of them having been in them for longer than six months.  What new plans has the Taoiseach to address this?  Will he personally ensure rigid targets are set to reduce month on month the number of homeless children?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800014#M00400","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1519820400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>The figures for the number of people in emergency accommodation that were published yesterday are bad and they are distressing for everyone affected by homelessness and for everyone who is working night and day to resolve the enormous social problem we face.

Many of us hoped that was the beginning of a trend but it is certainly not possible to say that at the moment as they have gone back up again.  That says to us that we must redouble our efforts to increase the supply of affordable and social housing and all other forms of housing.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, that is the fundamental solution to this problem.  Following seven years of almost no houses being built, we are ramping up housing construction again - both social housing and private sector housing.

What Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank or potentially AIB are proposing to do is entirely in line with Fine Gael policy in government over the past five years.<\/p>  <p>  Tens of billions of euros have been sold off to hedge funds, private equity giants and international banks.  The biggest seller in this was the State through the medium of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  The liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, facilitated the sell off of &euro;22 billion in loans in a matter of months.  This all started, appropriately enough, in Davos in 2014 when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, met with representatives of American vulture fund, Lone Star.  They offered to buy all of NAMA's debt and was turned down.  When Deputy Noonan returned, he asked NAMA how it could tap into this international demand for distressed Irish assets.  NAMA moved from managing assets to a sell off agency - the very thing which NAMA was supposed to prevent.  A fire sale of distressed assets was actually initiated by NAMA under the Taoiseach's Government's watch.<\/p>  <p>  Tax breaks were also introduced to further entice the vultures.  Only &euro;20,000 was paid in tax by 24 different companies despite controlling &euro;20 billion in assets.  The use of section 110 allowed huge investment entities from the United States to pay between &euro;75 and &euro;250 in tax.  It is shameful.  Fine Gael policy, without a whimper of protest from the Labour Party in government, was to save the banks.  If people lost their homes or small businesses, that was just collateral damage.<\/p>  <p>  There is now talk of extending Central Bank regulations to cover the vulture funds.  The idea this is a solution for people with mortgage arrears will not stop repossessions or evictions.  It does not correspond with reality.  Yesterday, in my constituency, an elderly man in poor health was due to be evicted.  After our intervention the sheriff has agreed to postpone the eviction for a month.  We have been trying to find alternative accommodation for him for two years.  We have not been able to do it through the council.  That is the reality of people's lives.<\/p>  <p>  I suggest to the Taoiseach, as a key part of the solution, as per the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' charter for housing rights, that there should be no evictions without suitable alternative accommodation.  There can be no evictions to nowhere.  Evicting a family or an individual into homelessness must be prohibited by law.  That has to be the case because we know the resolutions are only voluntary with the banks and lenders.  People are facing evictions.  Immediate emergency legislation is needed to amend the Housing Act 1998 to give local authorities a statutory duty in this area and the resources necessary to back them up.  Will the Taoiseach do this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800015#N02100","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1519821000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I totally appreciate the considerable concern that exists around the proposed sale of mortgages by Permanent TSB.

We agreed to accept in principle legislation from Fianna F&aacute;il to extend regulation over investment funds.  We are bringing forward legislation proposed by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, to strengthen the courts in their requirement to take into account family circumstances such as the ones the Deputy mentioned when it comes to repossession.  We are looking at other options as well.  We are very much on the side of honest people who are making an honest attempt to pay their mortgage, to pay down their loans if they can and to settle their debts.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland we have strong protections for homeowners, for borrowers and for mortgage holders.  If one looks at a the number of repossessions relative to other countries, it is much less likely that a home will be repossessed in Ireland than in many other countries, such as Spain, the UK and many others.  That is because of the strong protections we give to homeowners and borrowers in terms of property rights and the rights that apply to those individuals.  The number of repossession orders is going down.  We have been told on many occasions there would be a tsunami of repossessions.

The new chief executive is doing well too on &euro;1 million a year.  The European Central Bank, ECB, does not agree.

On Monday night, there was an attempted eviction of a family in Balbriggan.  This family was engaged with the bank and was paying the agreed amount.  However, a move was still made to move the family out of its home.  The main point I want to make is that the Central Bank regulations, the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, does not guarantee no repossessions if people engage with the lender.  I have experienced that as I am sure everybody in this Chamber has.  Some 10% of Members go to Mr. David Hall of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation looking for support.  We are all engaging in these situations with the bank.  I repeat the point that there is a solution and there is action that can be taken.

I thanked President Mattarella for Italy&rsquo;s continued solidarity and support in our particular concerns arising from Brexit.  We exchanged views on the negotiations to date and outlined our shared ambition for a close and comprehensive future relationship with the UK.  I acknowledged the challenges Italy faces in migration and expressed our appreciation for the work of the Italian Government, local authorities and NGOs in dealing humanely with large numbers of migrants.  I also noted the importance of solidarity here and the need to assist front-line member states.  President Mattarella expressed appreciation for our support, including our decision to opt in to the EU relocation and resettlement measures agreed in 2015 and our provision of a series of fully crewed naval vessels to assist Italian authorities with search and rescue efforts in the Mediterranean.<\/p><p>On an earlier point, I heard the Minister for Health say he has formally withdrawn the proposal about the name Phoenix Hospital for Children.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that this hospital be called after Dr. Kathleen Lynn, a veteran of 1913, 1916 and also the founder of the first infants hospital, St. Ultan's in Charlemont Street.  There are no women who were involved in the revolutionary period commemorated in any public buildings in the State that I am aware of.  I make that suggestion because I think it would be accepted-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800020#R05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Deputy-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800021#S00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>In relation to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800021#S00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":465,"content":"<p>In fairness-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800021#S00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I am being helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800021#S00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I think the Deputy wants to ask the Taoiseach whether he consulted the President of Italy on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800021#S00600","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I have just taken the Chair and I understand this question is about a meeting with the President of Italy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800021#S00700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Well I am sure the Taoiseach was talking about culture with the President of Italy; how women participate and are named and publicly honoured is a really important part of culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800021#S00800","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":470,"content":"<p>It is not that relevant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800021#S00900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":471,"content":"<p>As the Taoiseach is, I am sure, aware Italy has quite a good record in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800021#S01000","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Even by all stretches of the imagination-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800021#S01100","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":473,"content":"<p>What aspects of immigration did the Taoiseach discuss with the President of Italy?

Having told us last year how eager he was to have a much greater public engagement on European Union issues this reluctance to engage with the House is surprising and somewhat disappointing.  It is also surprising that he is not willing to have any discussion on the European Union's budget.  I have tabled a question on that for later.  He was not willing to discuss institutional reform or any other issue before setting out Ireland's position at the summit.  Given that he briefed the media that they were important discussions he is not in a position to say that only minor issues were on the agenda.<\/p>  <p>  The budget is part of the third group of questions.  On reform, it is my understanding that the majority at the summit disagreed with the Taoiseach's willingness to sign up for the Spitzenkandidat system and the introduction of transnational Members of the European Parliament, MEPs.  These proposals significantly marginalise small countries and undermine the fair balance of powers and accountability within the European Union structure.  We need to discuss this seriously in the House. <\/p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach confirm that he has agreed to reject the insistence of the European Parliament that the groups decide on the Commission president?  This process in 2014 had close to no impact on citizens but denied a proper debate between countries about the leadership of the Commission.  I note the Taoiseach has expressed his concern about the failure of the media to give enough coverage to his speech last year launching a so-called national dialogue on Europe.  It is important that we have a decent debate on these issues to do with institutional reform in this House.<\/p>  <p>  If the Taoiseach is going to maintain the position he adopted in Strasbourg he will at the very least seek some legitimacy and submit it to the D&aacute;il for a vote.  The Spitzenkandidat process effectively removes the ability of Ireland and other countries to have a say in deciding on critical issues.  The Taoiseach should acknowledge the right of the D&aacute;il to have its say before agreeing to such a move. <\/p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach tell me the current status of the digital taxation discussion?  Will he publish any additional information or impact assessments of it before next month's summit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800021#S01300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I know it is tangential to the point but I want to voice my support for Deputy Burton's suggestion on the naming of the national children's hospital.

The initial responses from some are perhaps predictable but they are regrettable nonetheless.  It now seems that the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, are rejecting this draft agreement as wholly unacceptable, constitutionally dubious and something that they are not prepared to tolerate.  Those are their words.  There is a job of work to be done in defending the interests of this island in its totality, in insisting on respect for the mandate of the people in the North to remain within the European Union.  Will our Italian friend, Sergio Mattarella, be an ally in this regard?<\/p>  <p>  If dialogue on the future of all aspects of Europe is to be successful it has to be genuine.  Very often we try to dress up something to do with European affairs as a debate but the insistence of the political establishment is that there is only one orthodoxy, one correct way to approach Europe and anybody who is in any way critical or questioning is \"anti-European\" or a \"bad European\".  If there is to be any kind of fruitful dialogue and it is absolutely essential at this juncture we have to dispense with that.  It is clear that we need a change of direction.  The direction of travel which suits corporate interests and the political establishment is one that has been deeply alienating for citizens on the ground and for people who care about Europe and who are proud to be Europeans, as I am, that is very worrying.  That has been the direction of travel for quite some time but it is brought into very sharp focus by Brexit, by developments in Europe and other member states where the far right and ultra-right has a very destructive grip on the political dynamic.

There are worrying signs that he sees no difference between the State's interests and those of his own party.  He said yesterday that this is not even an issue about which we should be talking.  The reason this issue keeps arising is because it involves a personal initiative of the Taoiseach to radically alter established practice when it comes to the use of public money to promote Government rather than specific initiatives or basic public information.  It goes to the heart of distinguishing between the State, the politicians in government and the wider political debate.  In defence of himself, the Taoiseach has now adopted the incredible position that we have a new unit of 15 people in his Department initiated by him that does nothing new and is not responsible for the output for which it is paid.  Incredibly, we are told that it did not sign off on X, Y or Z.  The Taoiseach has continued the now weekly habit of completely misrepresenting others in his defence.  Of course, he has disgracefully attacked as false the work of a journalist who has had the temerity to point to inconvenient facts.  Is it the case that the Taoiseach, as the member of Government responsible for this public spending, thinks there is nothing wrong whatsoever with public funding resulting in the non-office holders and candidates of one political party being used in advertising?  I have not received an answer to that question to date and I would like one.  Is that acceptable?  Does the Taoiseach think it okay that candidates of one political party should appear in Government advertisements paid for by the taxpayer?<\/p>  <p>  Why is the Taoiseach so completely uninterested in the comments from editors and journalists to the effect that they were pressurised to present Government advertising as part of normal coverage?  It was a bit late to say yesterday that it should be clearly delineated and separate.  The Taoiseach should not pretend that he did not know what was going on for the past number of weeks in respect of this matter.  Will he stand over the fact that newspapers were informed that there would be more to come if they did as they were told?  Does he not agree that an independent review of practice should be established to ensure that proper party political boundaries and political boundaries are respected?  If he does not agree with this, could he indicate why?  If the Taoiseach is completely satisfied and fully confident that everything is fine, surely an independent review will simply say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800022#T01800","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1519825200,"counter":513,"content":"<p>If Mediaforce was the company that placed these advertisements, who in the Department signed off - as the client of Mediaforce - on behalf of the Government?

How much money is to be spent on these?<\/p>  <p>  Lots of people have told me there are advertisements in cinemas at present at the end of which the Taoiseach is featured.  Could the Taoiseach indicate the number of cinemas in which the advertisements running?  People from Wexford and other counties, not just Dublin, have seen the advertisements as part of cinema advertising.  Could the Taoiseach explain to us now or later in detail if he does not have the details to hand the names of the cinemas and so on?<\/p>  <p>  I also want to ask the Taoiseach about section 41(3) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which prohibits an advertisement that is directed towards a political end.  This is presumably why RT&Eacute;, TV3 and national radio cannot carry these advertisements.  Two weeks ago and again last week, I suggested to the Taoiseach that this is essentially unethical and crosses a line for which political parties are funded as political parties.  We have no problem with every Fine Gael hopeful and would-be candidate being funded by Fine Gael.  We object to the Government of the day funding its candidates in advertorials or paid for advertising.  There is a gap in the law but I will ask the Opposition parties to have a look at the law so that in respect of the ban on political advertising, which has served the country well in a variety of contested spaces down through the decades, we would look at introducing the same measure so political funding goes to the parties and they spend it within the law as they see fit but the action of the Government is on behalf of the people of Ireland.  What the Government is doing is unethical and crosses a line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800022#T01900","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1519825200,"counter":514,"content":"<p>In response to a parliamentary question from Deputy &Oacute; Broin yesterday, the Taoiseach said that an indicative budget of &euro;1.5 million has been allocated for publicity in respect of Project Ireland 2040 and confirmed that the launch event for this plan cost approximately &euro;45,000.<\/p><p>This is a ludicrous abuse of taxpayers' money, particularly given that so many elements of this development plan and capital projects had already been announced and were not new.

We had a similar occurrence this week on this issue where the deputy leader of the Labour party, Deputy Kelly, compared my Government and civil servants in my Department to the Third Reich, to Nazis and to Goebbels, which was wholly inappropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800023#U05200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1519825800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800023#U05300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1519825800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I am not thin-skinned by any means, but describing the Government, civil servants or any individual as being akin to Nazis, the third Reich or Goebbels is defamatory and beneath the level of discourse that should occur in politics and in this House.

It is not good enough for the Government to say that it had nothing to do with it and that it is at arm's length.  One cannot be at arm's length from the proper spending of taxpayers' money.

As somebody who has been the victim of the most atrocious assault and slander on social media, for the Taoiseach to suggest to me that I would countenance, for one moment, other people from any party or none behaving in an inappropriate way in the course of debate to other people, I can say that I do not do that and have never done that in my political career.  The Taoiseach and I have shared a constituency.  He is very familiar with those subjects on which I have contributed.  To throw around accusations of a general kind here is completely inappropriate and dishonours the Taoiseach's office.  When one becomes Taoiseach, one is meant to meet a higher standard.  The Taoiseach is clearly annoyed and irritated that something that has been, understandably for Deputy Varadkar as Taoiseach, a prize project has been subject to criticism here.  I would say to the Taoiseach that he is perhaps a little too thin-skinned about that in the context of his replies.  Deputies Mich&eacute;al Martin, Howlin, Adams, the new leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy McDonald, and I have all asked a repeated series of questions at different stages over the last month or so to which we have not received satisfactory answers.  If we received satisfactory answers, we would have stopped asking the questions.  Instead, the Taoiseach's answers have become more convoluted.  In fact, his answer there about departmental assistant secretaries meeting twice a week in answer to the question by Deputy Michael Moynihan sounds more like a theological answer that might come from a priest, bishop or lawyer than from a Taoiseach actually answering about the day-to-day concerns of people who are worried about the roof over their heads and the state of their health service.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and his Ministers should develop a sense of proportion on this.  There is a system in this country which has served us well, with direct funding from the State for political parties which allows political parties, within the rules, to spend that money on the promotion of the political purposes of their party and the promotion of their ideals.  There is then Government funding and when political parties take office there are potentially great opportunities for whoever has the honour to become Taoiseach or a Minister to promote ideas in that Government.  There is a strict division between party political and the Government position.  The Taoiseach is honoured to be in government and needs to carry the can and take responsibility for this.  What he is trying to do now is divert.  I would say that references in this House to Goebbels and the propaganda unit that he had are, in my view, inappropriate and I think anyone who has been involved in that should reflect and pause because it does not help our debate.  Equally, I think the Taoiseach is trying to distort what has been said.

I suggest to the Taoiseach and the Government that it is not in their long-term interests to allow the matter to persist.

I have no difficulty with replying to questions.  I do my best to do so every day I am in the House.  Last night I met a person who expressed surprise that I had to answer so many questions so frankly.  I always try my best to do so.  However, I can only answer questions to which I know the answers.  I can only account for myself and, through written replies to parliamentary questions, my Department can account for its staff.  I cannot answer questions on behalf of third parties, contracted organisations or regional or national newspapers; rather I can only answer questions about myself or the actions of the civil servants employed in my Department and that is what I will continue to do.
