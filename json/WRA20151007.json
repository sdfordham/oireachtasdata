This role is not just with regard to land-eligibility, but it can also play a beneficial role with regard to habitat conservation and enhancement.    In particular, burning has traditionally been used to help manage land in upland areas and is one of the means by which these important habitats were created in the first place, followed by a balanced grazing regime. In more recent times, however, much of the knowledge of how and when to burn land correctly has been lost as the farming activity on these upland zones decreased. Most of these areas are commonages, and many are now seriously under-grazed, which has had a detrimental effect on both land eligibility and biodiversity. <\/p>  <p>  Under GLAS, one of our main objectives is to restore these uplands to agricultural and environmental health. To do that, we have created a specific measure within the new scheme that encourages shareholders on commonages to come together and draw up a new Commonage Management Plan with the help of a trained GLAS commonage advisor. The main component of this plan is a new grazing regime on every commonage, which is tailored to the needs of that commonage, and to which each shareholder must now commit and contribute. Within that plan we have also provided for the possibility of supplementary actions, including controlled burning. If that is to form part of the new management regime, it must be planned properly and carried out in strict accordance with the relevant legislation. Where burning takes place in full compliance with these requirements, there is no issue in relation to land eligibility. <\/p>  <p>The Guide to Land Eligibility, which issued to farmers this spring, makes this quite clear when it states as follows: \"Where land has been burned, it is not in a state suitable for grazing or cultivation and therefore is not eligible. The exception to this is where controlled burning is carried out in full compliance with all relevant environmental legislative requirements and any other lawful requirements, having first consulted with and notified the Garda&iacute; and the local fire service.

Applications were received from every single county and virtually every action was selected at some stage.  On the basis of the plans submitted for the 27,000 applications received to date, we have already met or exceeded RDP targets for Low Input Permanent Pasture, Protection of Watercourses, Laying Hedgerows, Planting New Hedgerows, Planting of Traditional Orchards, Bird, Bee and Bat Habitats, Wild Bird Cover and Stone Wall Maintenance.   <\/p>  <p>  For the second tranche of GLAS, which I intend to launch next week, I have revisited the various actions that will be available to farmers in the light of the substantial progress made to date. GLAS differs from previous schemes in that it adopts a very targeted approach to meeting its environmental objectives and the RDP includes a provision for review and reassessment after the first tranche. Not all the actions which have met or exceeded targets require to be adjusted, given that the associated spend is in many cases relatively easily accommodated in within the total budget. <\/p>  <p>  However, given the very high uptake of Low Input Permanent Pasture (LIPP), it is proposed to adjust the provision for this action under the next tranche. It will still be possible to take up to 10 hectares of either LIPP or Traditional Hay Meadow as before, but the LIPP component will be limited to 5 hectares. While this means that we will still see permanent pasture coming into GLAS, I hope it will encourage more farmers to take the hay meadow option, which is well behind target, and which delivers the same payment per hectare. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the planting of new hedgerows, I am proposing to suspend this action for Tranche 2, along with the planting of traditional orchards. Both actions have met their targets for the entire RDP, and there are concerns about the availability of planting stock. I will, however, review this for Tranche 3. I am also reducing slightly the maximum length for coppicing from 1000 metres to 750 metres. This action is well on target and if possible I would like to encourage farmers to continue to take up the hedge-laying option which has already proved very popular. <\/p>  <p>  On birds, and following discussion with farmer representatives, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Bird Watch Ireland, I am proposing a number of changes which will make it easier for farmers to adapt to the new regimes required, and which will encourage even greater uptake. <\/p>  <p>  For Natura land, I am providing for part-parcel actions, combined with compatible actions on the remaining part-parcel. Again, this follows discussions with farmer representative and other stakeholders and will provide for greater flexibility. <\/p>  <p>  On protection of watercourses, I am also providing for this action to be available on any land adjoining a water course where cattle may have access, and not just on grassland parcels. <\/p>  <p>  For rare breeds, and as explained previously in this House, I am making it possible for farmers who acquired Kerry Bog Ponies and Galway Sheep in 2014 and who joined the relevant societies, to enter GLAS now under Tier 1.

I have always attached major importance to the live cattle export trade, and my Department, along with Bord Bia, has been extremely proactive during my time as Minister in both encouraging and facilitating shipments abroad and the cross border live trade to Northern Ireland.  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has in place a good system of transport links to facilitate live exports with the highest standards of animal welfare being at the forefront of procedures for approving transportation options. My Department has approved extra roll-on roll-off ferry capacity for livestock transport in the year to date. There are currently three dedicated vessels, the MV Express 1, the MV Atlantic M and the MV Holstein Express approved for the carriage of livestock by sea from Irish ports. Two roll-on roll-off vessels are approved for transport to the UK, and one to the France. Three other vessels are currently at various stages of the necessary processes for approval for carriage of livestock abroad. The Department always co-operates with live exporters to the fullest extent possible in order to facilitate live exports while ensuring that all vessels meet our high standards required.   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to have a strong live export trade to Europe and beyond with over 236,000 head of live cattle worth over &euro;172million being exported last year. So far in 2015, Ireland has exported live cattle to seventeen different countries and the total figure for live cattle exports stands at just under 150,000 head. Our most important markets this year have been the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Spain, Italy, Britain and France. The Dutch calf market in particular has seen sharp growth, with almost 44,000 calves sent there so far in just nine months of 2015 as opposed to 39,000 head in the whole of last year.

Unfortunately a temporary top-up in the intervention price for SMP did not enjoy the support of all Ministers or the Commission. However the improved PSA scheme for SMP, which will include longer periods for storage as well as the improved aid rates, the re introduction of PSA for cheese, the provision allowing 70% advance in the single farm payment, the provision of increased funding for promotion, and the provision of almost &euro;14m in targeted direct aid for farmers can go some way towards alleviating the worst effects of the current market downturn. <\/p>  <p>Provision of targeted aid is also a significant initiative. In order to address the existing market disturbance efficiently and effectively and to prevent the situation resulting from that disturbance, or its effect on the market, from continuing or deteriorating further, the Commission deemed it appropriate to provide grant aid to Member States in the form of a one-time financial grant. The aim of this is to support farmers in the relevant sectors who are experiencing the most acute price fall and consequences of the prolongation of the Russian import ban. <\/p>  <p>  Taking these factors into account, Ireland has been granted an allocation of &euro;13.7 million from an overall fund of &euro;420M. I am consulting with stakeholders at present and will make a decision on the use of this aid in the very near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700069#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Administration","counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700069#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[34212\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700069#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on his Department using the green low-carbon agri-environmental scheme as a means to reduce participants&rsquo; claimable area and that of their neighbours who are not participating in the scheme.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":35,"content":"<p>I presume the Deputy is referring to the preparation of Commonage Management Plans under the new measure introduced for commonages as part of the Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environmental Scheme , GLAS.

The findings, therefore, can only be applied to the situation in Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland badger populations are not controlled, even in areas where the historical risk of TB is high.  As the Deputy is aware, my Department implements an official badger population control in areas where badgers are implicated in TB breakdowns and, in this respect, the situation here differs from that in Northern Ireland. As I have stated, the study referred to relates to the possibility that TB may be spread by illegal interference with a sett, not by the removal of badgers in a controlled manner as implemented under my Department&rsquo;s programme. Accordingly, it has no implications for the implementation of this programme. In addition, in Ireland we have no evidence that interference with badger setts may be contributing to maintaining bovine TB. It is the experience of staff in my Department that they very rarely find any evidence of badger sett interference, such as discussed in the research paper to which the Deputy refers. I should also stress that interference with badger setts is illegal and where such instances are found by staff of my Department the details are passed on to officials in the National Parks and Wildlife Service who follow up such reports.<\/p>  <p>There is very considerable scientific evidence of a link between badgers and cattle in the context of the spread of bovine TB. Research conducted over the years by my Department and others has demonstrated that the eradication of bovine TB disease is not a practicable proposition until the issue of the reservoir of infection in badgers, which is seeding infection into the cattle population, is addressed. It is therefore necessary to eradicate TB in both species. In view of this, the comprehensive TB Eradication Programme as implemented by my Department has incorporated a badger removal and population control policy since 2004.   <\/p>  <p>  While the current approach to badger control is cost effective and has contributed significantly to the very significant improvement in the disease situation in recent years, the ultimate objective of my Department is to incorporate badger vaccination into the Irish TB eradication programme. However, this strategy can only be deployed when data are available to ensure that this can be done in an optimally effective and sustainable manner. In view of this, various projects, involving vaccine development and oral-delivery techniques are under way (including a collaboration with the United Kingdom), with a view to developing a viable badger TB vaccine and vaccination strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700069#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Milk Prices","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700069#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[34222\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700069#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the progress made to date in negotiations with the European Union on increasing its market intervention price for milk to reflect production costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>Provisions in the CMO indicate that the reference thresholds and by extension reference prices for intervention shall be kept under review by the Commission, taking account of objective criteria, notably developments in production, costs of production and market trends.

The Commission have been reluctant to engage in such a review, preferring to utilise enhanced supports in other areas. Furthermore, they have made it clear that the legislative procedure under which this would be undertaken would entail an 18 month lead in time. In such circumstances, my preferred approach was to examine the possibility of utilising provisions under &ldquo;Exceptional Measures&rdquo;, to introduce flexible instruments, such as a modified or temporary intervention scheme, more quickly, by delegated act.   <\/p>  <p>In early September I presented a paper offering possible solutions to both the EU Commissioner and my EU ministerial colleagues.

With global demand outstripping supply, Irish fertiliser prices have increased by 6-8% so far in 2015. It is anticipated that world demand will continue to increase into the future maintaining upward pressure on prices to the final consumer in Ireland.   <\/p>  <p>The advice from Teagasc is for farmers to keep in contact with merchants as prices often spike at periods of high demand when European order books are full. Purchasing fertilisers at off-peak periods will help minimise prices. Teagasc further advises that finding alternative sources of major nutrients will save money and farmers should consider the use of slurry applications to minimise expenditure on chemical fertilisers. In addition, soil testing will prevent unnecessary applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700069#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sale of State Assets","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700069#WRB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[34217\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700069#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the rationale behind the sale of Coillte&rsquo;s portfolio of telecommunications assets; his plans to sell off other Coillte assets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>The rationale for the disposal of Coillte&rsquo;s portfolio of telecommunications assets is that it will enhance Coillte&rsquo;s focus on its core activities in forestry and the operation of its board mills, which was an underlying principle in the Government Decision relating to Coillte in June 2014.\u00a0 The restructuring is also consistent with the Government Decision, also relating to Coillte, in June 2013. I understand that Coillte has stated that the proceeds from the transaction will strengthen the company&rsquo;s balance sheet and support their ongoing investment of &euro;59 million in one of their panel board subsidiaries, SmartPly which is based in Belview Port, outside Waterford city, and further investment in its renewable energy business.  In relation to the actual transaction, Coillte Teoranta was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act 1988. In compliance with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, such a significant disposal was a matter for the Board of Coillte while my approval and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the disposal were required, also under the Code of Practice. The business was sold through a competitive bidding process in which the sale of the assets was widely advertised. The sale was handled on Coillte&rsquo;s behalf by Goodbody Corporate Finance and overseen closely by the Board of the company.   <\/p>  <p>Coillte has stated that, while sites at 298 locations were included in the sale, the total area of land associated with these sites is less than 15 hectares. The company has also given an assurance that access to its forests for recreation use is unaffected by the sale of their telecoms portfolio.   <\/p>  <p>The decision to dispose of Coillte&rsquo;s telecommunications portfolio was not made by me or the Government. It was a business decision by Coillte to capitalise on the significant value built up in its telecommunications business over the last 30 years at a time when there is considerable interest in acquiring infrastructure assets and to use the proceeds for re-investment in core aspects of its business thus creating new State assets.   <\/p>  <p>As I have mentioned, under the Code of Practice, significant disposals are a matter for the Board.

The longer term perspectives remain very positive and Irish dairy farmers are well placed to take full advantage of rising global demand. The ending of EU milk quotas has not witnessed anything that could be described as a spike in production at EU level. Ireland has sought to avail of the opportunity that longer term trends will bring.    I have maintained ongoing contact with the Irish banks and have impressed upon them at every opportunity of the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015 and into 2016. Most recently at the dairy forum, I reiterated these calls to the three main banks in attendance. The Irish dairy sector is cost competitive and Teagasc figures indicate that Irish farmers have relatively low levels of indebtedness compared to counterparts in competition countries. The banks assured me that they will remain vigilant on this issue, particularly if prices continue to deteriorate into spring 2016 therefore and will be facilitative in the measures available and in their dealings with dairy farmers. They stressed the need for early engagement for those who see early signs of such liquidity imbalance. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has also been proactive of course and chief among the initiatives here are provisions allowing dairy and other farmers to use income averaging over five years when it comes to paying income tax bills.

For the second tranche of GLAS, therefore, I am revisiting the various actions that will be available to farmers in the light of the substantial progress made to date. <\/p>  <p>  GLAS differs from previous schemes in that it adopts a very targeted approach to meeting its environmental objectives and the RDP includes a provision for review and reassessment after the first tranche.

As things stand, over 20% of the entire budget for GLAS is set to be paid on Low Input Permanent Pasture, and we clearly cannot continue to accept additional hectarage at the same rate indefinitely.  However, it is important to note that it will still be possible to take up to 10 hectares of either LIPP or Traditional Hay Meadow as before, but the LIPP component will be limited to 5 hectares.

The Chinese authorities decided in February 2015 to lift the BSE ban on boneless beef from animals under 30 months of age from Ireland making us the first EU MS to achieve this goal.  This move, while very significant, does not permit trade to commence and my Department is working closely with its counterparts in China to conclude the necessary technical steps, which need to be completed before trade commences.  The US market was opened to Irish beef exports in January 2015.  Feedback from exporters eligible to export beef to the US indicates that exports to date had reached approximately 330 tonnes by early September.  This would have an approximate value of &euro;2.1m.  This is a very encouraging start, particularly given that the trade to date is confined to the market for intact cuts as we currently await approval to export beef intended for grinding.  It must be remembered that only two plants were eligible to export up to mid-May and June respectively.  There are now six plants approved to export and my understanding is that this momentum in exports will continue and grow right through to the end of 2015.  As with any new market it takes time to build reputational brand and a customer base and the real time to assess its value is when these are bedded down.   <\/p>  <p>  More importantly the relatively high prices available for beef in Europe this year means that US buyers can be priced out of the market and Irish exporters are choosing to send product to more valuable markets in the UK and on the continent.  Exports to the UK are up 4,000t compared with the same period in 2014 and this coincides with a reduced kill overall (back about 6% year on year) highlighting further the strength of Irish beef exports in the UK.  This of course is helped by a strong sterling and weak euro. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, 2015 has been a very positive year for beef prices in Ireland with the yearly average to date almost 10% up on last year; &euro;4.04 for an R3 steer excluding vat, compared to &euro;3.70 in 2014, a 10% increase.  Prices last week are 10% up on the same week last year notwithstanding recent price decreases.  Ireland is currently at 104% of the EU 15 price and 107% of the EU 28 price. <\/p>  <p>  There has also been significant progress in facilitating trade in other international   markets for Irish beef.  For example I recently concluded an extension to our market access to the Philippines, where already this year there has been almost &euro;10 m of beef exports from Ireland , making us the second largest exporter of beef into the Philippines.  Furthermore we are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries including Korea, Vietnam and Mexico.  It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global marketplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700070#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700070#WRC01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Applications","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700070#WRC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[34748\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700070#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if an increase in rent support will be facilitated for a person (details supplied) in County Kildare given that the person's rent has now increased to &euro;1,300 per month; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must:<\/p>  <p>- have at least 520 paid contributions, and<\/p>  <p>- satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages).<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994 allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.<\/p>  <p>  However the scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the appropriate rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.<\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  Where someone over 66 does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may apply for a non-contributory pension, which is based on need and is means tested.  The maximum rate of this pension is &euro;219 weekly, which is 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension.<\/p>  <p>  Where it is more beneficial for the claimant, they may instead seek an Increase for Qualified Adult payment, on their spouse&rsquo;s State pension contributory, the maximum rate of which is &euro;206.30.  This increase is, by default, paid directly to the Qualified Adult.<\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.

The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. <\/p><p>Overall, the Youth Guarantee provided nearly 25,000 places for young people in 2014 (a similar number are expected to be provided in 2015).

The reduced rates have been extended over the intervening years and now apply to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients under 26 years of age.<\/p>  <p>  The reduced rates do not apply to certain categories of jobseeker, for example those with a qualified child or those whose claim is linked to a previous claim at the higher rate made within the previous 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  The reduced rates for young jobseekers are a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.  The measure aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment.<\/p>  <p>  There are a wide range of education and training opportunities available through the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. These opportunities for jobseekers support them in strengthening their qualifications and skills base thereby maximising their chances of meeting the requirements of the modern labour market and gaining employment. These opportunities include the back to education allowance scheme, Education and Training Board (ETB) training courses, VEC education courses, T&uacute;s and JobBridge - the national internship scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There is a network of case officers at a local level who work with social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes for them.  Young jobseekers who participate on an education or training programme will receive a higher weekly payment. For example, young jobseekers who participate in the t&uacute;s programme will have their payment increased to &euro;208 per week and jobseekers who attend ETB training courses will have their payment increased to &euro;160 per week.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection administers the back to education allowance scheme (BTEA) which is an educational opportunities scheme for persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments wishing to pursue second or third level courses of education subject to meeting the qualifying conditions.  The objective of the scheme is to raise educational and skills levels to enable them to better access to emerging labour market needs in line with the Government&rsquo;s activation strategy set out in Pathways to Work.  For persons under the age of 26 who are in receipt of an age related jobseekers payment, a personal maximum rate of &euro;160 applies.  The full year cost of increasing the back to education allowance rate to &euro;188 per week for recipients aged under 26 years is estimated at a maximum of &euro;6.6 million.

Credit unions are currently not subject to the dormant accounts legislation. Accordingly, accounts in credit unions that have not been reclaimed by the owners for at least 15 years are not transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund.<\/p>  <p>  The Credit Union Act, 1997 (as amended) does not make reference to Dormant Accounts. Dormant accounts in credit unions, and the practices surrounding them, are governed by Rule 22 of the Standard Rules for Credit Unions published by the Irish League of Credit Unions.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by DECLG that an analysis of the benefit of adding dormant credit union accounts to the Dormant Accounts Fund has not been carried out. In practical terms, increasing the amount available in the Fund does not necessarily allow for the introduction of new dormant accounts measures or programmes, which is the focus of\u00a0DECLG\u00a0in respect of the\u00a0Fund. While applying the provisions of the dormant accounts legislation to credit union accounts could increase the size of the Fund, Government Departments must source monies for dormant accounts programmes and measures from their Exchequer allocation in the same way as with any other funding programme. When the monies expended on dormant accounts measures and programmes are reimbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund, the refund is to the Exchequer rather than to the spending Department. For this reason, dormant accounts expenditure is subject to the same constraints within Departments as any other spending programme.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, expenditure on new dormant accounts measures or programmes would serve to increase Government debt levels, as moneys disbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund belong to the account holder, who can reclaim it at any time, and not to the State.\u00a0 Consequently, every euro spent from the Fund is regarded in accounting terms as a potential Government liability.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It would be a matter for Government on the advice of the Department of Finance or DCELG to decide\u00a0on any\u00a0extension\u00a0to the Dormant Account legislation to\u00a0include credit unions.

The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  <\/p>  <p>  Where breaches of any regulatory requirements occur, firms and\/or individuals can expect vigorous investigation and follow through by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank regularly conducts themed inspections to ensure compliance with all of its codes of conduct, including the CCMA.\u00a0 Breaches of regulatory requirements are dealt with using appropriate supervisory powers, including Administrative Sanctions powers, where appropriate.   <\/p>  <p>  There is no legal issue, therefore, over whether or not regulated entities are to comply with this statutory code.\u00a0 Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the\u00a0CCMA and\u00a0non-compliance with the CCMA\u00a0is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.\u00a0 The precise issue that arose before the Courts was the extent to which non-compliance with the CCMA could be adjudicated by the Courts in a repossession case between a lender plaintiff and a borrower defendant.\u00a0 In that regard, the Supreme Court found that where a breach of the\u00a0CCMA involves a failure of the lender to abide with the moratorium referred in the CCMA, but in no other circumstances, non-compliance with the\u00a0CCMA affects a relevant lender's entitlement to obtain an order for possession.\u00a0 Following on from this, a breach of any other aspect of the\u00a0CCMA does not in itself adversely affect a lender's contractual right to possession in the circumstances of mortgage default.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Supreme Court found that the CCMA prohibited lenders from seeking an order for possession where the moratorium was not complied with but that it did not prohibit the seeking of an order for possession in other circumstances.  The Supreme Court has therefore ruled that where the Code of Conduct prohibits the seeking of an order for possession the Courts will enforce that prohibition.  To quote from the judgement of the Supreme Court:<\/p>  <p>  \"A financial institution which, entirely ignoring the provisions of the Code in that regard, simply went ahead and sought possession as soon as it was legally entitled so to do would be doing the very thing which the Code is designed to prevent.  For a court to entertain an application for possession which was brought in circumstances of clear breach of the moratorium would be for a court to act in aid of the actions of a financial institution which were clearly unlawful (by being in breach of the Code) and in circumstances where the very act of the financial institution concerned in seeking possession was contrary to the intention or purpose behind the Code itself.\"  <\/p>  <p>  Where the code does not so prohibit and where it is not illegal for an order of possession to be sought then it is not a matter in which the Courts will intervene.  I am pleased to note that the Supreme Court decision has in fact recognised that the CCMA forms part of the law and that a regulated financial institution is obliged, as a matter of law, to obey it.  However, it should also be noted that in a repossession case before the Courts a borrower's rights are not confined to the provisions of the CCMA.  \u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The 2013 Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act has provided a new statutory\u00a0avenue to borrowers in a repossession case involving a primary dwelling to seek an adjournment of the repossession case to allow the borrower the opportunity to consider and, if so decided, to propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) to creditors in order to resolve an unsustainable debt position.\u00a0 If this is approved by the Court, the debtor would then be in a position to formally propose an alternative and sustainable payment arrangement irrespective of whether or not the primary home lender considered or rejected such an arrangement under the CCMA.\u00a0 Also, under a PIA there is an onus on the personal insolvency practitioner to,\u00a0insofar as is reasonably practicable, formulate a proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in, or cease to occupy, a private principal residence.\u00a0 Even if such a PIA proposal is rejected by creditors, the Personal Insolvency Act has now been amended to provide that the proposal can then be submitted to a Court for adjudication.  <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the genuine concerns Deputies may have regarding the implications of the particular decision for borrowers in genuine difficulty with a mortgage on their own home.\u00a0 While the full implications of the decision can be considered further by my own officials\u00a0and the Central Bank, as I have already noted, the Central Bank has powers to both supervise and enforce that Code.\u00a0 In any event the recent changes to the Land and Conveyancing Act and the Personal Insolvency Act has given a statutory right to a borrower to propose a sustainable solution to creditors, or failing that a court, as an alternative to repossession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700074#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions Regulation","counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700074#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[34939\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700074#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will refrain from commencing consultation paper 88 until such time as full consideration is given to the recommendation of the International Credit Union Regulators Network Report that a review be carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":186,"content":"<p>My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.   <\/p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank\u00a0is the independent regulator for credit unions.\u00a0 Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to  support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.   <\/p>  <p>  While it is important to distinguish this division of roles,\u00a0it is equally important to recognise that both the Registrar of Credit Unions and myself, as Minister for Finance are working together for the safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the International Credit Union Regulators' Network (ICURN) review was to assess the performance of the Central Bank's performance of its regulatory functions in relation to credit unions.  The review assessed the legal, regulatory and prudential supervisory framework in place to fulfil  the Central Bank's mandate under section 84 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and accordingly focused on the legal and regulatory framework for the regulation of credit unions in effect at the time of the review.  Overall the review found that the Central Bank effectively performs its functions in the regulation and supervision of the credit union sector.  <\/p>  <p>  The review included\u00a0a number of\u00a0recommendations for refinements under the\u00a03 broad areas: Supervisory Approach; Communications and Guidance; and Resources. ICURN made a number of recommendations in relation to each area.\u00a0 Under the heading Communications and Guidance,\u00a0ICURN also suggested\u00a0that consideration be given by the relevant authority to directing a\u00a0review to evaluate the implementation of the\u00a0recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions.  ICURN further stated that this is not a matter for the Central Bank. As Minister for Finance I have no plans at this time to carry out such a review.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced at end December 2015.  It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.  These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.  I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process.  When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions.  It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.  It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period.  Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations.   <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.   <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed.  It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations.  The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments in this matter.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate business development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework.  As set out in the feedback statement on CP88, the Central Bank intends to invite interested parties to discuss business model development in the coming months.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700074#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Data","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700074#WRG00950"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[34948\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700074#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"for the number of farmers, in tabular form, who availed of the various tax reliefs specifically in the income tax, stamp duty, capital gains tax and inheritance tax codes for farmers for the most recent year that this information is available; the cost of each relief to the Exchequer for that year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that farmers may avail of a number of tax reliefs.

My Department engages on an ongoing basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassy staff, on market access issues. These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement to export Irish beef to, Japan, Singapore, Egypt, Iran and the US, to export sheepmeat to Singapore, South Africa, the Philippines the UAE, and Canada and to export pigmeat to Australia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Serbia. <\/p><p>In relation to China, there has been a lifting of the ban on boneless beef from Ireland for animals under 30 months. However, further work is required before trade will commence and my Department is at present engaging with the Chinese authorities on these technical aspects. <\/p><p>Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across the European Union. This broad portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy, which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmental sustainability, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality. Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives in 2015 is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of the Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink. Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop and commit to sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities. <\/p><p>The poultry sector plays an important role within the Irish agricultural economy, accounting for approximately 2% of gross agricultural output and supporting around 5,000 jobs, most of these in rural areas. Export values for poultry meat have increased steadily over the last few years to c. &euro;310 million in 2014, growing by 20% alone in the last year, as the value of trade was driven by increased shipments of processed products. A high proportion of these exports are destined for the UK market and redirected to international markets through agents for fifth quarter&rsquo; product like chicken feet in particular. Strong fundamentals supported demand in almost all regions of the world in 2014 and this is expected to continue in 2015, although some easing in global poultry prices is expected. <\/p><p>The development of a viable pigmeat sector is a priority for me, given the crucial role which the industry plays in supporting approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services. In 2014 export volumes increased by approximately 7%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets. Export values increased by some 3% and are in the range of &euro;570 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years. The growth in Irish pigmeat exports to international markets evident over recent years has been negatively impacted by the restrictions of the Russian trade ban, however this has been offset by the opening of alternative spot markets such as Vietnam and the Philippines. These Asian markets will continue to provide valuable opportunities for Irish pork producers into the future. <\/p><p><b>Milk Markets<\/b><\/p><p>The milk quota regime ended on March 31st. The abolition of milk quota presents a massive opportunity for the Irish dairy sector and one which we should look forward to with confidence. Planning for the post quota period has been ongoing amongst all stakeholders for a number of years and I believe we have the right balance of measures in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new era with full confidence. <\/p><p>Irish Dairy produce is exported to approaching 130 countries and in 2014 exports were valued at over &euro;3bn. Due to its reputation and significant global footprint, the dairy sector in Ireland retains significant future growth potential. The removal of quotas will be a key driver in this respect. Ireland exported dairy products worth &euro;2.3bn in 2010 and by last year this had risen by over one-third to over &euro;3bn. I remain acutely aware of the need to develop as many market outlets as possible for Irish dairy products. Notwithstanding our successful trade performance, I continue to work with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agrifood sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere. <\/p><p>Since taking office I have led Trade Missions to a variety of destinations in recent years, including China, the United States, Algeria, Japan and the Gulf States, in order to promote Irish Food and Beverages and dairy promotion has been a significant feature of such missions. I intend to lead missions to China, Vietnam and Africa in the coming months. Most market analysts predict that medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products. My aim is to help position the Irish dairy sector to be able to take advantage of this opportunity. <\/p><p><b>Seafood<\/b><\/p><p>Irish seafood exports recorded an increase of 7.3% in 2014 to reach a value of &euro;533 million. The main EU markets, namely France, Spain, UK, Italy and Germany continue to dominate seafood exports, accounting for in excess of 50% of export values. However, this compares to a 60% share in 2012 and demonstrates the on-going focus of the leading Irish seafood exporters in the development of new business in emerging markets to offset some price resistance in core European markets. <\/p><p>The seafood sector offers huge potential for expansion. There are a number of significant macro trends which are expected have an impact on the future direction of the Irish seafood sector and which indicate that the prospects for this industry both at a global and European level are very favourable, especially in the medium to long term. Strong global population growth , which is expected to reach 8 billion by 2025 , will result in a huge new market for seafood. Some experts estimate that an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood will be required annually by 2030. Coupled with the forecast global population growth, the rate of income growth in the Asia Pacific region is also anticipated to have far reaching implications for the consumption and trade of seafood. <\/p><p>Despite the opportunities for Irish seafood in emerging markets, it is important to note that longer term opportunities are not restricted solely to these regions. One of the key achievements of the sector in 2014 was the growth in exports in the core European markets with Ireland maintaining its premium position and growing sales on the back of four years of sluggish growth. In the longer term, supply constraints in these markets as a result of the shift in global supply to the East will present niche opportunities for Irish seafood exporters. It is important therefore that Ireland&rsquo;s strong position and reputation in these markets is maintained and promoted to encourage loyalty and to hold market share. <\/p><p>Bord Bia recognises the significant growth potential of seafood and is committed to supporting the Irish seafood sector in taking advantage of these opportunities through an expansion of its seafood marketing and promotions programme over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700076#WRJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Labelling","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700077#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[34843\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700077#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which traceability continues to be enforced throughout the food production sector, with particular reference to the need to ensure clear indication regarding the origin, husbandry, compliance with national, international and European Union regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>My colleague the Minister for Health has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation and the new EU food information regulations which were adopted by the Council of Health Ministers in December 2011.  However, my Department plays an important role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators (FBOs).  The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done through a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators are required to have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<\/p>  <p>  Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that FBOs at all stages of production, processing and distribution within the businesses under their control, must ensure that the requirements of food law are satisfied.  In regard to traceability, the regulations require that FBOs must have systems in place to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food.  They must also have a system in place to identify the other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  This is commonly referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional traceability requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224\/2009 and its Implementing Regulation 404\/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is also carried out in each Department-approved plant, which includes checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating both in EU Member States and third countries.  Labelling and documentary checks also form part of the routine checks conducted by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by EU Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements, designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.  Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  The import controls procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance.  Reports of the findings of inspections are published on the FVO&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  In order to import fish or fishery products into Ireland from a third country, the person who wishes to import the products is required to register with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA).  The SFPA and the Border Inspection Posts operate an agreed sampling plan, which is reviewed annually, to ensure that they meet the EU criteria with respect to potential contaminants, and for the presence of any medical residues or where there is concern that the product may not be fit for human consumption.<\/p>  <p>  Specific requirements for consumer information for fishery and aquaculture products such as more detailed information on provenance are also set down in EU Regulations under (EU 1379\/2013) on the common organisation of markets.  The Regulations on fish labelling are enforced by the SFPA as part of ongoing official controls in food establishments under their supervision.  Comprehensive labelling checks including country of origin are carried out in establishments under SFPA official control as part of routine inspections by authorised officers and at retail level by the Environmental Officers.<\/p>  <p>  Rules on the labelling of meat and meat products\u00a0are laid down in EU legislation. For beef, compulsory rules have been in place for many years, and require food business operators to label fresh, frozen or minced beef with specific information to enable the product to be traced back to the animals from which it was derived.  This must include details of the slaughterhouse and de-boning hall in which the animal was processed, and the country in which it was born, reared and slaughtered.  In 2011 the European Union passed the Food Information for the Consumers (FIC), Regulation 1169\/2011, which is applicable to all foods intended for the final consumer and including foods delivered to mass caterers.  In particular, the FIC Regulation extends mandatory origin labelling to meats other than beef for the first time.  The implementing provision is Commission Regulation No. 1337\/2013, which introduced mandatory origin labelling for meat from pigs, poultry, sheep and goats with effect from the 1 April 2015.  Under this regulation, labelling is required to identify the Member State or third country of rearing and the Member State or third country of slaughter for these meats.  The term &lsquo;Origin&rsquo; can also be used where the country\/member state of birth is the same as the country of rearing and slaughter.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been a strong proponent of such rules and I have signed into law a new Statutory Instrument to ensure that the necessary provisions are in place to implement this mandatory labelling requirement.  In addition, my Department is working closely with the Department of Health with a view to extending the legislation to include &lsquo;loose meats&rsquo; e.g. meat cuts sold through butcher counters.  I expect rules to cover loose meats to be introduced before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700077#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pigmeat Sector","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700077#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[34844\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700077#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he expects the pigmeat sector to develop and remain viable for producers for the foreseeable future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>The development of a viable pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the crucial role which the industry plays in supporting approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services.  In 2014 export volumes increased by approximately 7%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets.  Export values increased by some 3% and are in the range of &euro;570 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years.  Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery.  My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and the difficulties that this is causing for producers.  Having said that, it must be noted that Irish prices remain broadly in line with the EU average at present.  However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices.  This is a function of the market.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports, I am fully aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market.  My Department has met with the Russian authorities on a number of occasions to impress upon them the importance we attach to the normalisation of trade with Russia.  However the restrictions on other products under the EU-wide ban is not something which Ireland alone will resolve and will only be progressed through a common EU approach.  The Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution.<\/p>  <p>  At last month&rsquo;s Special Meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels, I joined with other like-minded Ministers from other EU MS in calling on the EU Commission to monitor market developments and deliver a comprehensive package of support to address the current difficulties in the Irish and EU pigmeat sector.  The resulting package reflects the majority of the demands presented by Ireland to the Commission who awarded almost &euro;14 million in direct aid to Ireland and the maximum flexibility announced by the Commission in the use of these funds.  I am currently consulting with stakeholders on how to disburse this aid.  The reintroduction of private storage aid for pigmeat and the improved aid rates and conditions will also help to bring the market back into balance.<\/p>  <p>  Support is provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways.  Firstly I have included provision in the Rural Development Programme for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors.  Some &euro;37 million has been allocated for 2015.  Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.  Other elements of the RDP, such as a targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector.<\/p>  <p>  Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level.  Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc supports Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector.  The programme which is funded by a voluntary industry levy has enabled Teagasc to employ four additional advisors and researchers to support producers and the sector through advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector.  The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards.  This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pigmeat.<\/p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets.  Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.<\/p>  <p>  For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors since the closure of the Russian market last year.  In this regard I was pleased to announce the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.  My Department will continue in its efforts to develop access to international markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700077#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry Development","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700077#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[34845\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700077#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he expects the fishing industry to develop in the future, with particular reference to value-added products, and employment in the sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[34847\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700077#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which families dependent on fishing continue to be able to rely on a reliable income in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 93 together.<\/p>  <p>  Foodwise 2025 recognises that seafood, in common with the broader food sector, will benefit from the projected increasing global demand for food produce over the coming decade.  Current FAO estimates are that world consumption of fish will grow by an average annual consumption of 17 kg per person per annum resulting in a requirement for an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  The report identifies that Ireland is well placed to take advantage of this opportunity because of our natural advantage of being adjacent to some of the most productive fishing ground in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  In order to avail of this opportunity we need to pursue a strategy of growing raw material supply through sustainable development of aquaculture and encouraging landings into Irish ports of quota compliant catch by other Member States.

The poultry sector supports around 5,000 jobs, most of these in rural areas.  The value of primary output for the total poultry sector stood at approximately &euro;186 million in 2014.  Given that the forecast for consumer demand remains somewhat stable, estimates for 2015 stand at &euro;186 million.  Export values have increased steadily over the last few years to c. &euro;310 million in 2014, growing by 20% alone in the last year as the value of trade was driven by increased shipments of processed products.  Strong fundamentals supported demand in almost all regions of the world in 2014 and this is expected to continue in 2015, although some easing in global poultry prices is expected.  Irish production is forecast to remain stable during 2015 as EU and international production is estimated to increase marginally.  Poultry is normally reared under contract to processors for a pre-agreed price, which underpins a level of continuity in the supply chain, however, the impact of cereal price changes may influence output decisions by producers as the year progresses.<\/p><p>The poultry sector remains very competitive, and given that Ireland is over 100% self-sufficient in poultry meat and 85% self-sufficient in egg production it is important to have the edge provided by Bord Bia`s Quality Assurance Scheme.

Under TAMS II, energy investments, water meters and medicine dispensers are envisaged for the poultry sector.  Support for Knowledge Transfer Groups also covers a number of sectors, including the poultry sector.  These groups will cover issues such as financial\/risk management, animal health and welfare, breed improvement, environmental protection, climate change and innovation and their operation will largely mirror existing templates already in operation in the beef and sheep sectors.

The model is about renewing, reinvigorating and restructuring the community policing function within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver a consistent national structure to the community policing function, a more co-ordinated and efficient Garda service to the community and a spread of good practice and quality of service in community policing on a national basis.<\/p><p><b>Community Garda Kerry Division<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Tralee Garda Station <\/th><th>Killarney<br \/><br \/>Garda Station <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>*2015<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><\/table>* 31 August 2015<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700080#WRN02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Station Closures","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700081#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[34880\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100700081#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the savings from Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na station closures in the Kerry division since January 2011.","asker":"1047","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>The Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme was implemented in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during 2012 and 2013.

In its review of the Garda Station Network which informed the Programme, Garda management concluded in relation to certain stations that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Programme, there were a total of  twelve station closures in the  Kerry Division in 2012 and 2013.

The new hospital will be co-located with St. James's Hospital, and ultimately tri-located with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, which will re-locate to the campus in due course. Satellite centres of the hospital, providing urgent and outpatient care, are to be built on the campuses of Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's decision that the new children's hospital should be co-located with St. James's on its campus in Dublin 8 was clinically led. In 2006 McKinsey report, Children&rsquo;s Health First, which recommended that the population of Ireland and projected demand could support only one world-class tertiary paediatric centre, that this should be in Dublin and ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital, to ensure relevant sub-specialty and academic linkages.  The McKinsey report recognised the importance for quality of healthcare of having a critical mass of sub-specialist skills in a tertiary centre and stated this could be achieved firstly, by serving a large enough population to support a full complement of sub-specialists and secondly by co-locating with an adult teaching hospital thus enabling access to specialties that encompass both adult and paediatric patients, facilitating clinical and academic &ldquo;cross fertilisation&rdquo;, and attracting the top staff. A number of subsequent reviews and reports on this project over the years since 2006, most recently the 2012 Dolphin report, reaffirmed the importance of co-location with a major adult academic teaching hospital. This was a critical factor in the Government&rsquo;s decision in November 2012 that the new hospital should be co-located with St. James&rsquo;s, as the hospital with the widest range of clinical specialties and national services from an adult perspective, and an excellent and well established research and education culture and infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  On 10 August 2015 the NPHDB submitted a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and, subject to planning, it is hoped to be on site at all three locations in early 2016.  During the design process, there were extensive consultations  with families, young people and children who are former or current users of the service, with staff of the existing hospitals, with clinical leads and with local residents. This process has led to the development of a world-class building which has been designed to enable staff to deliver the best possible clinical care for children and young people, while also seeking to provide a pleasant environment for staff and families. All in-patient accommodation will be in single en-suite rooms, with in-room parent accommodation, while the planning application also includes a family hostel to be located on the campus.

These measures were implemented at time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.<\/p>  <p>  Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement.
