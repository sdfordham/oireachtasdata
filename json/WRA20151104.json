At the outset, I would point out that it is up to an individual, following consideration of the terms on which voluntary redundancy is being offered, to decide whether or not to avail of voluntary redundancy.    I understand from my colleague with responsibility for terms and conditions in the public sector, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that the terms that should apply in the case of redundancy of public servants are set out in the Collective Agreement: Redundancy Payments to Public Servants which was agreed between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and ICTU in June 2012. <\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for deciding whether to offer a voluntary redundancy scheme in a particular agency rests, in the first instance, with the agency itself and its parent Department.  In the event that those bodies consider it appropriate to offer voluntary redundancy, sanction for the scheme has to be sought from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.    <\/p>  <p>  My Department has no role regarding the terms and conditions of voluntary redundancy schemes which are negotiated between employers, employees and their representative bodies.  However, my Department is responsible for ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s robust suite of employment rights legislation is respected, and that individuals can vindicate their rights.  <\/p>  <p>  In particular, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to Section 13 of the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 which renders void a provision in any agreement which purports to exclude or limit the application of any provision of that Act.  The caselaw provides that Section 13 does not preclude employers and employees from compromising a claim under the Acts provided that the employee has given &ldquo;full and informed consent&rdquo;.   The Labour Court has held that in order for a settlement or compromise agreement to be upheld, the terms of any waiver must be construed strictly against the party from whom it emanated, any agreement to waive statutory rights must be supported by adequate consideration and the waiver should arise from an agreement reached after meaningful negotiations and after professional advice has been sought and given.    <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive suite of employment law is underpinned by the workplace relations bodies which, since the 1st of October, have been merged into the new Workplace Relations Commission and a re-constituted Labour Court.  An individual who considers that their employment rights have been infringed can make a complaint, under the relevant piece of legislation, to the Director General of the WRC, in the first instance and, on appeal, to the Labour Court.

Of course, it is not isolated from a State&rsquo;s taxation and social support systems.  <\/p>  <p>  So, at an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as those available in relation to housing, education and health. <\/p>  <p>  In the UK, it is a voluntary code with which some employers, who already pay in excess of the UK national minimum wage, have become associated. The Living Wage concept there draws its strength from the fact that it is a grassroots civil society campaign. At present, around 1,500 separate employers across the country have endorsed the approach. In the UK the Living Wage Foundation has calculated the 2015 UK Living Wage as &pound;7.85 and &pound;9.15 for London.<\/p>  <p>  While I am on record as endorsing the concept of a Living Wage I would differentiate between the application of a mandatory National Minimum Wage and a societal movement that would see employers volunteer to pay what might be considered to be a Living Wage.<\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission, which was established on a statutory basis in July this year, will on an annual basis examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels. The Commission presented its first report to me on July 17th in which it recommended an increase of 50 cent per hour to the minimum hourly rate bringing it to &euro;9.15. That increase will come into effect on 1st January next. <\/p>  <p>  I hosted a Living Wage forum in Dublin Castle on 30th September last which was attended by civil society organisations, trade unions and employers where discussion took place on the whole concept of a Living Wage in Ireland and whether and how it might be applied here. The Forum marked an important milestone in the national discourse on the living wage and I was very encouraged that so many employers have approached me in connection with supporting and developing the concept, and that significant employers have committed to pay the living wage. Further work is required on substance and detail about, for example, the proposed methodology behind the calculation of each year's living wage, about the impact on sub-contracting, outsourcing and the supply chain, about the cost of compliance in a business where affordability is a pressing concern and where adoption of the living wage would be a real and substantial commitment. The T&aacute;naiste announced at the Forum that her Department would make &euro;40,000 available to fund the next phase of work on the Living Wage Campaign. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400074#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1067"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exports Controls","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400074#WRA03400"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[37152\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400074#WRA03500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of licence refusals to exporters producing parts for military goods abroad from 2011 to 2015 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>My Department is responsible for controls on the export of military items from Ireland.

This concession can be open to abuse and companies can use the corporate form to evade debts that they are perfectly able to pay, for example, through tactical insolvency of subsidiaries within otherwise solvent corporate groups.  As a result, the legislature has developed a number of safeguards that are aimed at reducing the opportunities for abuse.   The most important of these safeguards is the common law doctrine of piercing the corporate veil. This occurs where the veil of incorporation is used fraudulently to shield the owners of a company from liability, and where the subsidiary company is merely a &ldquo;sham fa&ccedil;ade&rdquo; of its parent company. In such circumstances, the owners of the company can be made liable by the courts for money owed by the company to its creditors, including employees.  The courts are rightly hesitant to apply this doctrine liberally: much of the beneficial effect of the concession of limited liability would be compromised if veil-piercing occurred on a regular basis.

From the Policy Statement, IDA&rsquo;s new 5 year IDA Strategy &ldquo;Winning - Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rdquo;, was published in February 2015 and sets out a plan for IDA Ireland to broaden its target sectors further and to seek out new markets over the next five years.

This whole of Government effort has been integrated into the Action Plan for Jobs process which aims to strengthen the enterprise base, support entrepreneurship, improve competitiveness and support regional development. Since the launch of the first plan in Q1 2012, 126,000 more people are at work - exceeding the original target of an additional 100,000 jobs by 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last eight years, in relation to jobs in clients of IDA and Enterprise Ireland, while there were at total of 34,980 full-time jobs lost in the 5 period 2007-2011, this trend of job losses has been reversed over the last three years with full time employment growing by 34,000 between 2012 and 2014 and an additional 4,750 part-time jobs have been created over the period. We have worked hard at local level to promote entrepreneurship and growth and to attract new investment to the areas that suffered most in terms of job losses, including for example through establishment of specific groups such as the South East Forum and Action Plan in 2011 to focus on the needs of that region, which had an unemployment rate among the highest in the country at that time. In the case of the South East region, the unemployment rate fell from 20.1% in 2012 to 12.0% at the end of 2014. <\/p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plans for Jobs Initiative was launched by Government in February of this year.

We have acknowledged that these businesses have a significant role to play in the sustainable recovery that is now underway in the Irish economy.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2011 Government policy has focused on supporting SMEs in accessing an appropriate supply of financing from both bank and non-bank sources. The Action plan for Jobs process has specifically targeted access to finance issues as being central to the welfare of business. A number of key policy initiatives have been developed which are contributing to the evolution of a more robust and effective platform for the financing of SMEs. These include:<\/p>  <p>  - Establishing the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) which will provide up to &euro;800m of funds.  Up until the end of July almost &euro;45 million worth of SBCI loans have been provided to over 1,600 Irish SMEs. The SBCI has also recently announced a &euro;50m SME finance initiative alongside Finance Ireland which will drive competition in Irish SME lending and further announcements are expected shortly.<\/p>  <p>  - The development and promotion of an innovative SME State Support online tool to provide an individual with a list of the possible government business supports available to their particular business;<\/p>  <p>  - Amending the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 and introducing a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme. This includes amending the scheme to provide funding to SMEs whose banks are exiting the Irish market.  In addition there will be legislative changes made shortly that will enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer loan duration, more products and finance providers, rebalance the risk between the State and financial providers to make it more attractive to the latter and flexible pricing provisions.<\/p>  <p>  - The finalisation and publication of the review of Microfinance Ireland (MFI) introduced changes that make it easier for small businesses to access funding directly from MFI.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above the Credit Review Office will review applications for credit made by SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks, who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  The Credit Review Office also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.<\/p>  <p>  As the economy moves into a new phase of growth there is an opportunity to further develop a policy agenda that addresses some of the structural constraints in the financing of the SME sector, such as the need for improved payment practices in Ireland. Trade credit is one of the most widely used sources of funding by Irish firms and the highest in the Eurozone. Trade credit is a crucial component of financing for many SMEs and disruption to the supply chain flow of payments can often be the deciding factor between solvency and bankruptcy.<\/p>  <p>  The economic crisis has presented significant challenges across enterprise in Ireland, but for SMEs in particular the issue of late payments is of critical concern. Late payments in commercial transactions have an adverse effect on businesses by straining cash flow, adding financial costs and fuelling uncertainly for many businesses.<\/p>  <p>  A recent initiative to improve payment performance and improve cash flow between businesses is the launch of the Prompt Payment Code (PPC). These initiatives, together with the late payment legislation, demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s ongoing drive and commitment to encourage a prompt payment culture in Ireland. Companies providing goods and services need cash flow certainty and are entitled to expect that their payments will be made in a timely manner. <\/p>  <p>  The PPC is about companies demonstrating a real commitment to responsible business practices which in turn leads to achieving competitive advantage in the market place. Government is leading by example and all Government Departments, their agencies and public sectors bodies have signed up to this Code. For the Code to work it is essential that businesses, big and small, make this important commitment to a prompt payment culture in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with other relevant Departments and agencies through the State Bodies Group chaired by the Department of Finance to ensure that appropriate financing for growth options are available to viable SMEs. This will require a clear focus on how best to maximise the benefits to SMEs of the evolving financial landscape in Ireland and the adoption of actions that contribute to developing a more diversified and competitive financial system, capable of financing the growth potential of Irish SMEs. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to monitor that availability of credit through biannual surveys of SMEs to ensure that they can continue to start, scale and succeed from Ireland and that they are in a position to drive our economic recovery and create further jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400078#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400078#WRE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":184,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[38584\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400078#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which support is being offered to facilitate job creation in the indigenous sector over the past eight years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":185,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland is the agency under my aegis to help companies throughout Ireland start and scale, innovate and remain competitive on international markets, now and in the future.

The manufacturing and internationally traded services companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a vital source of employment in every county in Ireland and are spread across a wide range of sectors.<\/p><p>In January of this year EI reported that its client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014. These companies continued to see year-on-year jobs growth in 2014 and they created 8,476 net new jobs - the highest net gain in the history of the agency. This employment growth demonstrates the direct impact that increasing exports has on jobs in Ireland. Enterprise Ireland supported companies now directly provide employment for 180,072 people, comprising 156,202 full-time and 23,870 part-time workers.<\/p><p>In terms of their overall contribution to the economy, Enterprise Ireland clients account for over &euro;22 billion in expenditure in the Irish economy and support more than 300,000 jobs (direct and indirect) in Ireland &ndash; this is equivalent to approximately 16% of the total workforce. <\/p><p>In order to help its clients achieve this, Enterprise Ireland uses a developmental approach across all aspects of clients&rsquo; needs, including business development, sales and marketing capabilities, innovation and R&amp;amp;D activity, technology development, continuous competitiveness and lean improvements, leadership and management development, and access to finance. <\/p><p>The outlook for new job creation in 2015 is positive and Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus will remain on ensuring that its clients have access to all of the necessary supports required to build on this momentum.  <\/p><p>Table A overleaf contains figures for jobs created by EI over the period 2007-2014 and the amounts of various funding allocated by the agency for the same period.<\/p><p>The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are now the First-Stop-Shop service through which all information on State supports for small and micro-businesses can be accessed.

Over the period 2008-2015, the LEOs \/ former CEBs received an Exchequer allocation of &euro;226.470m, of which &euro;129.245m was for Measure 1 (financial) and Measure 2 (non-financial) Capital supports.<\/p><p>At the end of 2014, total direct employment among the 6,058 LEO client companies stood at 31,326, of which 22,555 were full-time and 8,771 were part-time jobs.<\/p><p>The goal of this Government has been to replace all of the jobs lost during the economic crisis and deliver sustainable full employment by the end of 2018. This whole of Government effort has been integrated into the Action Plan for Jobs process which aims to strengthen the enterprise base, support entrepreneurship, improve competitiveness and support regional development. Since the launch of the first plan in Q1 2012, 126,000 more people are at work - exceeding the original target of an additional 100,000 jobs by 2016.

In 2008 the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government estimated the value of pollinators (including honey bees) for Irish food crops was worth at least &euro;53m. This does not include the value of pollinators in terms of non-food crops and maintaining bio-diversity in the wild. The value of honey produced in Ireland in 2014 was estimated at slightly over &euro;3m.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has not conducted a study to assess the possible impact of a significant bee disease outbreak, however I fully recognise that a disease outbreak, and especially an exotic disease outbreak, could have a significant negative impact on the Irish bee population.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of maintaining and further developing a healthy honey bee population. With this in mind, the signing into law of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 repealed the out-dated 1908 Bee Pest Prevention Act. American Foulbrood and the Small Hive Beetle are both notifiable diseases under the Notification and Control of Animal Diseases Regulations 2014 (SI No 110 of 2014). While American Foulbrood has existed in Ireland for many years the Small Hive Beetle has never been found in Ireland. In response to the 2014 outbreak of Small Hive Beetle in Italy my Department established a sentinel apiary programme earlier this year. This programme was established with the support of the Federation of Irish Beekeeping Associations and the Native Irish Honey Bee Society. Volunteer beekeepers in areas which are considered to represent greatest risk for the introduction of pests such as the Small Hive Beetle, as well as other beekeepers are participating in this programme. Over 20 beekeepers providing a representative geographical spread across the country are involved. A similar programme has also been rolled out across Northern Ireland. The sentinel apiary programme is designed with the objective of providing early notification in the event that any exotic pest or disease affecting honey bees arrives in Ireland. My Department co-ordinates the programme and has provided the equipment and guidelines to the beekeepers and also provides the diagnostic service to implement the programme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a bee diagnostic service is operated from the Teagasc laboratories at Teagasc, Oakpark in Carlow. Analysis of approximately 300 samples submitted by beekeepers each year are carried out and my Department is informed where a case of a notifiable disease is detected. Officials in my Department follow up where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The option of national action to limit or ban imports of bees must respect the primacy of EU Regulations. The EU has strict bee health certification requirements which apply to the international trade in bees. In accordance with Article 3 of Council Directive 92\/65\/EEC European Union Member States must not prohibit or restrict for health reasons the international movement of bees once all requirements set down in EU legislation have been met. While some Irish beekeepers seek to ban imports of bees into Ireland it must also be borne in mind that other Irish beekeepers wish to import these bees. Direct imports of bees into Ireland from outside the EU are not permitted although imports from other EU Member States which fulfil the EU&rsquo;s bee health certification requirements are permitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400080#WRG01400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Eligibility","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400080#WRG01500"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[38591\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400080#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the criteria for the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the first tranche of GLAS proved hugely successful attracting nearly 27,000 applications in all. Applications were received from every single county and virtually every action was selected at some stage. On the basis of the interest shown to date, I have no doubt that GLAS will succeed in attracting the 50,000 applications projected for it over the lifetime of the scheme.  On the basis of the plans submitted for the 27,000 applications received to date, we have already met or exceeded RDP targets for Low Input Permanent Pasture, Protection of Watercourses, Laying Hedgerows, Planting New Hedgerows, Planting of Traditional Orchards, Bird, Bee and Bat Habitats, Wild Bird Cover and Stone Wall Maintenance.<\/p>  <p>  For the second tranche of GLAS, which I launched recently, I revisited the various actions that are available to farmers in the light of the substantial progress made to date. Not all the actions which have met or exceeded targets require to be adjusted, given that the associated spend is in many cases relatively easily accommodated within the total budget.<\/p>  <p>  However, given the huge uptake on Low Input Permanent Pasture (LIPP), adjustments have been made to this action for the next tranche. It is still possible to take up to 10 hectares of either LIPP or Traditional Hay Meadow as before, but the LIPP component is limited to 5 hectares. While this means that we will still see permanent pasture coming into GLAS, I hope it will encourage more farmers to take the hay meadow option, which is well behind target, and which delivers the same payment per hectare.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the planting of new hedgerows, this action has been suspended for Tranche 2, along with the planting of traditional orchards. Both actions have met their targets for the entire RDP, and there are concerns about the availability of planting stock. I will, however, review this for Tranche 3. I have also reduced slightly the maximum length for coppicing from 1,000 metres to 750 metres. This action is well on target and if possible I would like to encourage farmers to continue to take up the hedge-laying option which has already proved very popular.<\/p>  <p>  However, the changes being made for Tranche 2 of GLAS also include areas where greater flexibility is being provided. In particular for birds, and following discussion with stakeholders and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, I have introduced a number of changes which will make it easier for farmers to adapt to the new regimes required, and which will encourage even greater uptake. I am also providing for greater flexibility on Natura land and on protection of watercourses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400080#WRG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400080#WRG01800"},{"type":"question","counter":241,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[38617\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400080#WRG01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the percentage of staff in his Department capable of dealing with the public in the Irish language; if there are training programmes in place for staff to improve their level of working Irish; the provision there is for other minority languages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":242,"content":"<p>As of December 2014 there are 74 staff members within my Department proficient in the Irish language, with a further 265 having availed of Irish language training.

Member States and regions can adapt and use this model to set up financial instruments funded by their rural development programmes (RDPs) under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). Financial instruments can take the form of loans, guarantee funds or equity investments. The funding for any such financial instruments would have to draw on Ireland&rsquo;s existing RDP allocation of EAFRD funding, as well as National Exchequer funding.  In our RDP, we have made a commitment to examine the potential for the use of financial instruments. However, the inclusion of financial instruments by way of a modification to the RDP is required by EU regulation to be based on an ex ante evaluation, which must assess:<\/p>  <p>- The existence of a market failure;<\/p>  <p>- The potential for added value;<\/p>  <p>- The resources required to implement a proposed financial instrument; and<\/p>  <p>- The proposed strategic approach to financial instruments.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, my Department has been exploring new and more competitive sources of funding and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) was established by the Government as a strategic SME funding company and includes the EIB as one of its funding partners.

Significant precautions are taken by the Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications. It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability, i.e. a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis.  All personnel have access to either an Irish military Medical Officer or to the UN provided medical service (depending on the particular mission) while overseas, to whom they could report any complaints, including potential side effects of any medications. Where a Medical Officer (MO) forms the opinion that the individual has developed a sensitivity to Lariam while overseas, the individual will be advised to cease taking the medication and substitute it with a &lsquo;second-line&rsquo; chemoprophylactic agent. The individual will be monitored thereafter.\u00a0 Ultimately, if serious enough, repatriation could be necessary if the MO felt that the individual was either not responding satisfactorily or where the symptoms were so severe as to require treatment not readily available in the Mission area.

In short, Roaccutane is prescribed when other acne treatments fail.  Serious acne can be a physical and social burden for patients while severe acne if left untreated, may cause permanent scarring.  <\/p>  <p>  However as with all medicines there are side effects and these are documented in the product information.  The product information also requires that Roaccutane should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements. <\/p>  <p>  While there is a favourable benefit versus risk for patients for a specific indication there is no basis to justify removing a medicine from the market.  Indeed such a removal could restrict access for a vulnerable group of patients to an effective treatment. <\/p>  <p>  Roaccutane is not authorised in Ireland for the treatment of cancer and therefore this is not reflected in the product information.  As stated above Roaccutane is authorised only for the treatment of severe forms of acne which have been resistant to other standard therapies.<\/p>  <p>  I have, in response to previous parliamentary questions, provided the Deputy with extensive information on the authorisation process for a medicine and the safety monitoring which is undertaken once a medicine is placed on the market.  Under EU legislation product information consists of the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.  These documents include information on cumulative safety data and experience obtained with use of the product including reports of side effects.  The product information makes no reference to Roaccutane as a treatment for cancer.  <\/p>  <p>  Information held by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) on suspected adverse reactions has been forwarded to the Deputy in response to previous parliamentary questions.  This information consists of a chronological list of adverse drug reactions and includes all the information available to the HPRA on age, gender and year.  In many cases only limited information is provided in the reports submitted to the HPRA and the HPRA has made all the information it holds available to the Deputy.  The HPRA will undertake a further review of individual reports to ascertain the number of patients requiring hospitalisation and reports of disability\/increased incapacity.  This review will take a number of weeks to complete and any additional information obtained from the review will be forwarded to the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  Requests for information on adverse drug reactions reports held by Roche Pharmaceuticals should be addressed directly to Roche.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA has no knowledge of correspondence with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning Roaccutane prior to or post 1983.<\/p>  <p>  Under European and Irish legislation ongoing monitoring of the benefits and risks of a medicine includes review and evaluation of suspected adverse reaction reports at National and EU level.  The national regulatory medicines authorities (in Ireland the HPRA) in each EU member state are responsible for gathering and evaluating national adverse reaction reports and in turn submitting these reports to the European Medicines Agency, which is responsible for the overall co-ordination of pharmacovigilance (measuring safety of medicines) activities across the EU. The minimum requirements, form and content of the information gathered under the pharmacovigilance system is determined at EU level and meets best international practice.<\/p>  <p>  Information on reports of adverse drug reactions held by other EU member states is available directly from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  It is important to clarify however that while Roche Pharmaceutical has withdrawn its authorisations to market Roaccutane in a number of countries for commercial reasons, other isotretinoin-containing medicines remain authorised and marketed in those countries.<\/p>  <p>  Information on individual Members of the Board of the HPRA and their qualifications is available on the HPRA website. <\/p>  <p>  I am not aware of the knowledge held by Members of the Authority on specific marketing authorisations issued in respect of specific medicines.  I am aware however that the acting Chief Executive Officer of the HPRA recently issued an invitation to the Deputy  to meet with the HPRA so that they could clarify the authorisation process and address the Deputy&rsquo;s specific concerns. I understand that the Deputy declined the invitation.  Given the volume of questions the Deputy has on this product he may wish to reconsider the offer of a meeting with the HPRA<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400090#WRR02100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400090#WRR02150"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[38640\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400090#WRR02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an appointment at Tallaght Hospital in Dublin 24 for a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":536,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The UN has a robust audit function with internal and external audit functions.  The United Nations Board of Auditors oversees the external audit function. Under their supervision audit opinions and financial statements for each UN organisation are prepared and submitted for examination to the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) who in turn forward to the General Assembly.  In addition, in coordination with our EU partners, Ireland also participates in negotiations on the UN Regular and Peacekeeping budgets in the Fifth Committee, and strives to ensure that value for money is achieved for the United Nations and its member states.<\/p><p>The budget of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is negotiated on a biennial basis to reflect the priorities of member countries and ensure value for money.  The budget is approved by the OECD Council.  Ireland participates fully in this process.  The OECD also operates a thorough system of internal and external audit procedures. Annual financial statements are prepared by the OECD Executive Directorate and examined by the external auditor, currently the French <i>Cour Des Comptes<\/i>which also audits French Government accounts.  The external auditor reports to the Audit Committee, comprising six members from the permanent delegations of members and three experts proposed by the supreme audit institutions of member countries.  The external auditor and the Audit Committee make regular financial reports to the OECD Council.<\/p><p>The Council of Europebudget is approved by the Committee of Ministers which consists of the Foreign Ministers of each member state. Internal audits are conducted by the Directorate for Internal Oversight and the external audit function is discharged by the supreme audit institution of a member state, appointed by the Committee of Ministers for a non-renewable term of five years.<\/p><p>The International Fund for Ireland (IFI)is an independent international organisation set up by the Irish and British Governments in 1986.  The Board of the International Fund for Ireland, as set out in its rules and procedures, appoints independent accountants and auditors who are selected by competitive tender.  The audit report is incorporated into the annual report and accounts of the IFI, submitted to the Irish and British Governments.  Details of the funding provided to individual organisations is published in the Annual Reports of the IFI.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fundawards grants to organisations working to further peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, on a cross-border basis and between Ireland and Britain.  In 2011, the budget allocated to the Reconciliation Fund was &euro;3m.  Since then, the budget has been maintained at &euro;2.7m.  In the context of the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, the Government underlined its commitment to support measures to promote reconciliation, including through continued annual provision of &euro;2.7m in the Reconciliation Fund.<\/p><p>Details of grants awarded from the Reconciliation Fund, including the names of all organisations granted funding, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website going back to 2012. () <\/p><p>Applications to the Fund are assessed on the basis of a number of criteria, as set out in the Reconciliation Fund Strategy 2014-2017.  These criteria include a requirement to assess the value for money of the proposed project, as well as the organisation&rsquo;s financial management capacity and sustainability.  Each project is assessed through a combination of project visits and monitoring as well as completion of narrative and financial reports outlining in detail the activities carried out, the costs involved, and progress towards the objectives of the project, and detailing how the grant has contributed to the achievement of some, or all, of the Reconciliation Fund key objectives;  and, submission of a signed copy of either: (i)The organisation&rsquo;s accounts, (where the grant is less than &euro;12,500 or equivalent) or (ii) The audited financial statements of the organisation (where the grant exceeds &euro;12,500 or equivalent).  Organisations are required to keep supporting documentation for all grant expenditure and are obliged to cooperate fully with any form of audit, evaluation or requests for further reporting on this grant requested by the Department.<\/p><p>In relation to the Department&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme (ESP)  , a planned programme of audits is in place to ensure the continued quality of the projects funded.  In 2014, audits were completed on six organisations funded by the ESP: five in Britain and one in Ireland.  These were undertaken by a consultant appointed on the basis of a public tender.  A further six audits will take place in 2015 &ndash; with another five organisations based in Britain along with one based in Ireland being audited this year by an external consultant.  In addition, reviews of two US-based organisations funded by the ESP were undertaken in 2014 by the Department&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit.  Separately, in 2013, a review of the work of six of the largest recipients of ESP funding in Britain was undertaken and, in 2014, the Clinton Institute in UCD completed a future needs analysis of the Programme.<\/p><p>As part of &lsquo;Global Irish: Ireland&rsquo;s Diaspora Policy&rsquo; which was launched in March 2015 a commitment has been made to spending 1% of the overall Emigrant Support Programme on quality assurance to ensure that the limited resources available are used to best effect to support the Irish diaspora abroad.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that all applicants for funding under the Emigrant Support Programme are required to submit either certified or audited accounts.  For organisations granted below &euro;100,000, the organisation&rsquo;s accounts should be certified by an independent, practising accountant.  For organisations granted over &euro;100,000, the audited financial statements of the organisation are sought.  Recipients of funding are also required to submit narrative and financial reports outlining progress since the award of the grant and detailing how the grant has contributed to the achievement of some, or all, of the Emigrant Support Programme&rsquo;s key objectives.  Where an organisation has used ESP funds inappropriately, has failed to use funds for the purposes for which they were granted or fails to satisfactorily report on how funds were utilised, the Department will take follow-up action, up to and including the refund of the identified amount of funds.<\/p><p>Full details of all recipients of ESP funding since 2006 are available at the following link: <font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font><\/p><p>The Department has funded Atlantic Corridor Irelandin facilitating, through its network activities and international linkages, the development of projects that assist in supporting sustainable development and enhanced educational attainment in the midlands region.

Rents for houses were 6.4% higher, while apartment rents were 7.6% higher than in the same quarter of 2014.<\/p><p>These annual rates of increase were driven mainly by the Dublin market. Overall, in the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 9.2% in Dublin (with house rents up by 8.8% and apartment rents higher by 9.4%). Annual growth in rents for the market outside Dublin was more subdued.

Social housing has been prioritised by this Government and over &euro;1.7 billion in Exchequer and local authority self-funding was allocated to the Social Housing Strategy between the 2015 and 2016 budgets, to support the provision of over 33,000 units. The Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan goes beyond 2016 and commits &euro;2.9 billion in capital funding towards social housing out to 2021. <\/p><p>Ultimately, the key to addressing upward pressure on rents is through increasing the supply of housing, which is a core focus of the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020<\/i>strategy. In 2014 the number of house completions was 11,016 units nationally, an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure. The latest figures for new house completions show that 8,914 units were completed to the end of September 2015, up 14% on the corresponding figure for 2014.As announced in Budget 2016, NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90% of these units to be in the greater Dublin area.<\/p><p>A range of measures is being taken to address homelessness by securing a supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness.\u00a0Progress in implementing these plans is reported through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.\u00a0The plans and progress reports are available on my Department's website at the following link:<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>In addition to these measures, I am continuing to work on proposals to address the issue of rising rents. The level of rent increases, particularly in the greater Dublin area, presents a serious challenge. The regulation of rent however, raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measures proposed are balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike. Ultimately, any decision in relation to this issue is a matter for Government and it is my intention to bring final proposals to Government for decision as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400096#WRX01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","counter":663,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400096#WRX01100"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[38595\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400096#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has finalised new planning guidelines for wind turbines; if not forthcoming, if local authorities can make new development plans with their own planning criteria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":665,"content":"<p>In December 2013, my Department published proposed &ldquo;draft&rdquo; revisions to the noise, setbacks and shadow flicker aspects of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines.<\/p><p>These draft revisions proposed:<\/p><p>- the setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments, <\/p><p>- a mandatory minimum setback of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and <\/p><p>- the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. <\/p><p>A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until February 21 2014.

This represented 5.2 percentage points of the 10% target required by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that in order to achieve the binding target for Ireland of 10%, a biofuel obligation rate of 12% by volume may be needed by 2020. Therefore, the obligation rate must be increased progressively on a managed and phased basis over the coming years. Last month, I launched a consultation seeking views on an increase to the biofuel obligation rate from 2016. The consultation closed last Friday and my Department is considering the responses received.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400097#WRY00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bord na M&oacute;na","counter":690,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400097#WRY00500"},{"type":"question","counter":691,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[38557\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110400097#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will establish a round table forum of Departments and local Deputies to assess and address the implications of the High Court rejection of planning permission to Bord na M&oacute;na to extend the lifetime of the Edenderry power station given the implications that it has for local employment and for the extension to the operation of the power stations at Shannonbridge in County Offaly and at Lanesborough in County Longford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":692,"content":"<p>Bord na M&oacute;na is a commercial State company operating under the Turf Development Acts 1946 to 1998.

Two locations on the Suir were surveyed in 2009, one upstream of the bridge in Waterford city and one downstream with a total catch of 1,888 eels. A further 1,410 eels were captured in the Barrow transitional waters during the 2009 surveys. The catching method in the study area was by way of un-baited fyke nets. <\/p><p>If I inform me that difficulties remain in obtaining density estimates for eels in large water bodies, due to the challenges for sampling methodology in such environments, and the migratory habits of eels moving upstream into the rivers and\/or leaving the transitional water as silver eel. Gaining accurate population densities of eel in transitional waters is challenging. <\/p><p>It is not possible therefore to state, with the certainty required that eel stocks in these areas are currently at levels which could sustain commercial fishing. It is also difficult to develop a conservation limit for the estuarine environment due to such movements of eels within the system. Acoustic tagging telemetry studies of eels in the Barrow are being undertaken to quantify their movements and to assist in determining eel density estimates in transitional waters.<\/p><p>To determine the population density within this area, a spatially explicit mark recapture experiment was carried out in the Waterford Harbour in July 2009. The Barrow and Suir Rivers and the Waterford Estuary were examined during a number of surveys in 2009 and 2011. Low mark-recapture rates indicated probable high levels of movement within these waters and made population estimation difficult. <\/p><p>Preliminary analysis of samples taken from the Barrow Transitional Water indicates a mean eel age of 9 years and an average growth rate of 3.78 cm per year. The high growth rate confirms the importance of transitional waters as a productive habitat for eels. In the absence of historic eel biomass estimates for the Waterford estuary to assess achievement of the eel escapement target, telemetry eel tagging studies were undertaken over the 2012 &ndash; 2014 period to assist in giving a clearer indication of the movement habits of eels in estuaries and improve population density estimates.<\/p><p>The results of River Barrow Fyke Netting Surveys, 2012-2014 and the River Barrow Acoustic Tagging studies, 2012-2014 including sampling locations are available in the IFI Eel Monitoring Report 2012-2015 available on the IFI website<b><\/b><\/p><p>The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) in 2014 is that &ldquo;the status of eel remains critical and ICES advises that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to &ndash; or kept as close to &ndash; zero as possible. <\/p><p>The annual recruitment to Europe has increased over the last 3 years from 5% to 12% of historic levels, however recruitment is still well below the reference levels of 1960-1979 and there is no change in the status of the eel as being critically endangered&rdquo;. <\/p><p>Ireland Eel Management Plan under EU regulation 1100\/2007 was reviewed in 2012 and again this year.
