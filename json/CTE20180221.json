I have prepared a very short presentation to take the committee through the key points of the pilot programme, following which we will be happy to answer questions the committee may have about the equality budgeting initiative.<\/p> <p>  Our work in progressing the equality budgeting initiative flows from the commitment in the programme for Government to develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.  There is also a commitment to ensure institutional arrangements are in place to support equality and gender proofing.  These commitments are reflected in the national strategy for women and girls 2017 to 2020.  Since last year we have been working to implement these commitments in a real and meaningful way.  In so doing we have engaged with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the National Women&rsquo;s Council which have been very helpful in guiding us in our approach. <\/p> <p>  Before I look in more detail at the pilot programme we have specifically adopted for this budgetary cycle, I want to highlight a few key principles that have underpinned our thinking and approach in this area.  We see equality budgeting as a tool that can provide us with greater information on the likely equality impacts of proposed or ongoing budgetary measures.  Greater visibility of such impacts enables us to better integrate equality concerns into the budgetary process.  It also enables the impacts of budgetary decisions to be subject to greater scrutiny.  In this way, we view equality budgeting as an important element of any well functioning budgetary system.  We do not view it as creating a separate and distinct budgetary process for specific equality measures; rather, it is about the equality impact of budgetary policy a whole.  From looking at international experience, countries that tend to do well in this area integrate equality budgeting into their existing budgetary framework.  That is something we have tried to replicate in our approach by anchoring the equality budgeting initiative in the existing performance budgeting framework in place.<\/p> <p>  Looking in further detail at the progress we have made so far, on budget day a policy paper entitled, Equality Budgeting: Proposed Next Steps in Ireland, was published.  I understand a copy of the paper was shared with committee members in advance of the meeting.  The paper looks at the international experience of equality budgeting, the existing mechanisms in place in Ireland to assess equality impacts and also the pilot programme for equality budgeting in operation this year.  Given the potential scale of equality budgeting, we  have decided, at least initially, to focus on the equality ground of gender.  From a practical perspective, this would be the most effective, as there is a wealth of international experience of gender budgeting and it is also an equality dimension for which a lot of disaggregated data are available.  Our intention is to learn from this approach and what we will do this year and then expand the initiative to other policy areas and equality dimensions in the future.<\/p> <p>  In advance of publication of the Revised Estimates we asked the six Departments participating in the pilot programme to conduct an assessment of their selected policy programme area for its impact on gender equality.  Following the assessment, they articulated a high level equality objective for the programme.  They then selected relevant performance indicators and targets which were set by the Department to enable us to track progress towards achieving the overall goal.<\/p><p>Following that assessment they articulated a high level equality objective for that programme.  They then selected relevant performance indicators and targets to enable us to track progress towards achieving the overall goal.  Progress towards achieving the targets will be reported on in the public service performance report. <\/p><p> The next slide gives an idea of the diversity of the programme areas that are included in the pilot initiative and the types of high level goals that have been articulated by Departments.  Six programme areas have been selected that cover a wide range of Government expenditure areas.  Each of the Departments has also published a number of performance indicators related to its objectives that will allow us to track progress towards achieving the equality goals.  Our intention is to learn from our experiences with these different programme areas this year with a view to expanding the initiative in future years. <\/p><p> In terms of the next steps, work is currently under way to prepare for the publication of the public service performance report.  Following on from the equality goals and indicators published in the Revised Estimates, the report will contain an update on the progress and steps that are being taken by Departments to work towards realising their objectives.  In order to guide our approach to the further development of the equality budgeting initiative we intend to establish an expert advisory group on equality budgeting.  The function of the group will be to take stock of progress to date and provide advice and guidance on the future roll-out and expansion of the equality budgeting initiative.  Alongside this we will also continue our work in supporting Departments participating in the initiative to develop the skills necessary to successfully equality proof policies. <\/p><p> That is an outline of the pilot approach so far and if members have any questions, we will be happy to respond.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018022100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Swaine","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519221600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Swaine for her presentation.

We have been talking about this issue in the abstract for quite a long time so to begin to see it in reality is quite interesting.  However, I am wondering about the choice of measures.  In terms of demonstrating the potential impact of equality budgeting, there may have been stronger measures and greater challenges to be presented to the participating Departments.  While female apprenticeship is really important, for example, access to education is even more important.  Barriers to both access and to education completion are crucial.  In terms of sport and given all of the controversies over the past 12 months involving the soccer team and the challenges faced by the Irish women's rugby team, the number of governing bodies supported by Sport Ireland's women in sport programme seems like a very weak measure in terms of addressing the actual challenges in the area of female participation in sport.  In fairness to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, it has taken on a very good high level goal.  Did the individual Departments pick those measures or did the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform pick them?  What are the plans to advance this?  I am particularly interested in the measures under way in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That is one of the Departments where an equality-budgeting analysis has the potential to have a deep impact and to address many of the challenges facing us.  The same is true of the Departments of Education and Skills and Health.  The measure chosen in the Department of Health is something to do with quitting smoking.  Again, while the objective of reducing the overall prevalence of smoking is very laudable and important, one would imagine that in the context of equality challenges there are other issues in health that would need that kind of analysis.<\/p> <p>  In summary, who made the choice in terms of the measures?  Did the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at any stage challenge those choices and look for something deeper?  Where is this going?  Once the pilot is finished, where does the Department intend to bring this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018022100002#C00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519221600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Calleary for his questions.  Certainly we would have high ambitions for the work under the equality budgeting initiative and would absolutely recognise the point the Deputy makes.  One hears a lot about equality budgeting and its importance and we all understand its significance and value in terms of the contribution it can make but one must ask what that refines down to in specific terms.  The indicators and objectives that have been chosen, from our perspective, represent a good cross-section of issues.  We are very happy with the engagement we have had from the relevant Departments.  The reality is that policy responsibility resides in those Departments and it is often the case that when we look at initiatives that relate to the expenditure framework, there is a somewhat legitimate view that it relates to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is our responsibility.  A good example of that is the issue of performance information.  We have engaged with this committee on that issue previously, flowing from the work of the OECD on budgetary scrutiny and parliamentary oversight of public spending with its focus on improving performance information.  What we have tried to do is integrate the equality budgeting initiative into that framework but the ownership issue is one upon which we must work with the Departments and we recognise that.<\/p> <p>  The specific indicators or objectives that are part of the initiative were developed over a relatively short period of time in advance of the budget.  As members know from previous meetings, we were working with organisations like the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC and the National Women's Council in 2017 in trying to scope out an approach.  When we finally decided on a way forward on this, it was only two or three months before budget day so we had to go to the Departments and ask them to come on board for this pilot initiative.  While we have been very clear that there is very significant learning available through the process that we have now established, it will need to step up significantly for us to be able to properly examine the contribution and value that it can add.  What we see as very important in that context is the role of an oversight or governance group with experts who can come in and give further momentum to the initiative going forward.  We did engage with the Departments on the objectives and as the Deputy has pointed out, the objective from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is a very significant one.  In terms of the Department of Health, we engaged with the chief medical officer and his team.  They thought that smoking reduction was a significant indicator but I take the Deputy's broader point that there are clearly much more significant equality issues to be addressed in the health and education systems.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018022100002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Beausang"},{"type":"speech","time":1519221600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I am not ranking them but it just strikes me that some are weak.

A lot of the Departments may have had other goals in mind initially but they needed further time to scope out the availability of data or put in place systems to record the necessary data.  I do not think it precludes future rounds of this initiative having more ambitious goals in that respect.  It is important for the first round of the initiative that everybody is able to participate at the different stages and contribute the data that is being collected and for the goals that are currently in place, we will be able to do that.<\/p><p>Two Deputies are waiting to come in and I ask them to bear with me for one moment, as I do not normally do this.  I want to follow on directly from Deputy Calleary's question because it relates to something the committee has been looking at.  There is a high level target of 300 for apprenticeships.  There is very little information around that.  There are tangible things that are easily measurable.  Has the Department figures for things such as the number of overall apprenticeships, the total number of women taking up apprenticeships, what access is there for them to do so or what percentage of uptake would the Department wish to see?  In his response, Mr. Beausang said that it was a start and we could do more later but I suggest it was a very limited approach.  If any effort had been made at a high level, the Department could have looked at the percentage of women who were able to take up apprenticeships.  That does not begin to deal with all the other areas of education which were not touched on at all.  Something as simple as saying that there are, for instance, 10,000 apprenticeships and we would like 50% of those to be made available to women by a given date could be done.  Was any consideration given by anyone to including something like that as a high level target?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018022100002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Swaine","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519221600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>If one looks at that equality budgeting objective for education in isolation, it does look quite stark but it sits in the Revised Estimates volume on the same page as the entire apprenticeship programme.

They have committed to that objective against the backdrop of where they stand.  It will require the Department of Education and Skill to do some very serious thinking about how to make apprenticeships more attractive to women and there is access to them, ensuring that there is a better gender balance.

It is reflected in the Parliamentary Budget Office's report today on the equality information on the budget documentation.  Over the years, the Department has done much work in trying to improve what we call the performance information.  Something that we see, and there is much international experience in this, is that if one is very clear about what individual spending programmes are meant to achieve - and perhaps in the past we have not been - it can have a significant effect on improving and enhancing those policies over time.  That is the mechanism we see working here.  Articulating these objectives in the context of the equality budgeting initiative drives change.  I will not sit here and claim that is across the board and that if one were to call to any random Department today and asked about the equality budgeting initiative that it would have much knowledge of understanding, but to be fair it is only a pilot at this point.

The fundamental point is whether this was a political decision.  Although the six areas are somewhat valuable, what of apprenticeships?  There is a difficulty in getting both genders to undertake apprenticeships, which must change, given that the professions of qualified plumbers, carpenters and other tradespeople are among the most useful and important in society.  The authorities in the United Kingdom considered establishing degree-level apprenticeships in order that people would have the same level of qualifications whether they were economists, carpenters, doctors or members of another profession.  That would add value to apprenticeships and could be considered in terms of making them attractive to both genders.  Also of interest are the situations in regard to arts and sport.<\/p> <p>  Was a political decision behind the approach taken in this area?  If the members on this side of the table were asked to address the issue, we would identify the most glaring inequalities in budget expenditure and see what could be done to address them.  Social protection accounts for approximately a third of budget expenditure and there is still great discrimination in how it is distributed.  This morning, the Taoiseach engaged with Deputy Paul Murphy on job activation.  Women are discriminated against in job activation.  As regards housing, families headed by a lower-earning woman face all kinds of discrimination in the context of a desperate social and affordable housing deficit.  Would it not have been more useful and immediate to address the big political expenditure decisions for which the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is also responsible?  I appreciate that steps in that direction are being taken.  I presume regard was had to the situations in the Basque country and Austria, which are of interest.  Some members met members of the Scottish Parliament last year and heard about a similar programme there.  Why was the other approach not taken?  Why did the Department not start by trying to remedy the really glaring inequalities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018022100002#E00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519221600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Our assessment, and possibly our instinct, was to walk before we run.  We consulted widely with experts.  Ms Swaine attended an OECD conference on gender budgeting and we took away lessons from other countries.  The lessons are not particularly reassuring in terms of the effectiveness of gender budgeting.  Many countries have engaged in gender and equality budgeting but whether that delivered the results for which people hoped is open to question.  Although I cannot recall the exact figures from the OECD survey, there was difficulty in identifying where an engagement with equality and gender budgeting generated clear change rather than shedding more light on issues such as those referred to by Deputy Broughan.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to be defensive about the pilot programme but it has been of benefit.  The child care issue and the objective in that regard is very significant and relates very directly to more general economic policy because the maintenance and enhancement of our growth rate over time will be achieved by enhanced female labour force participation and child care is an important element of that.  The objective regarding the level of female recipients of Science Foundation Ireland research grants is a very important signal for women in terms of access to STEM courses and their participation in that area.<\/p> <p>  Data and the availability of data are huge issues, as mentioned by Ms Swaine, because although the equality budgeting initiative is being referred to as a new initiative, distributional analysis has been conducted on the budget for many years using the simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, model, with which I am sure the Deputy is familiar.  It generates a significant amount of very useful information on the distribution impact of budget changes but there are many gaps and shortfalls in that information.  To try to build on and enhance the information available from SWITCH, the Department carried out social impact analysis whereby officials considered particular areas of public expenditure to try to form a baseline of information such that we have an understanding of the impacts of particular spending programmes on individuals and households.  In some instances, we found that the impacts were not very aligned with the initial objectives of the spending.  We are attempting to strengthen the general approach we take to these issues and the equality budgeting initiative is an important part of that.  We are not yet at a point of development whereby we can start embracing very substantial and significant issues that might have gender equality implications because we do not have the tools or data to do so, nor the experience of how to progress from an understanding of what these gender and equality issues are to how to change policy to address them.  At a certain level, what we are trying to do and the process we have described today is the easy part.  The difficult part is the change driven from a better understanding of a particular spending area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018022100002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Beausang"},{"type":"speech","time":1519221600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I appreciate the issues of which I am thinking are political decisions but it seems that to have gone after key areas of inequality, to set up channels to do that and to set in train the process in other areas might have been important.

The way I look at it, there are a couple of things involved.  On ownership of the whole thing, there were some initial comments made about departmental ownership.  I very much welcome the decision of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on this and his implementation of the pilot programme.  I would strongly suggest that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform grabs this by the scruff of the neck, as it would in many other areas, and sayS that it wants to drive this as an integral part of its work and to have ownership of how it will work right across all areas of Government.  It cannot be left to departmental ownership.<\/p> <p>  The second thing is that few good things come out of a recession and a collapsed economy, but there is one small thing which can be looked at in this area.  Things are now getting better and money is coming into the system.  Fresh money has been made available.  Consideration of gender should be hugely important when looking at that money and where it is focused in terms of the programmes and funding commitments to future programmes.  It is not a situation of pulling money back from somebody else, but of looking at and pushing key areas in terms of future balance.  I accept that it is a pilot programme and that there is headline stuff in it but someone mentioned walking before one can run in this area.  This is more strolling than walking.  It is very limited.  Even as a pilot it does not give us enough in this area on which we should be really focusing.  <\/p> <p>  To put an example to the witnesses, we might consider the area of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, and encouraging women into it.  Part of that work is obviously linked to education, schools, and access to STEM for women at second level - particularly in respect of providing courses in single-gender female schools.  There is no point thinking about that in an abstract manner at one particular level.  That is an example of where there must be an overarching view, because two or three Departments could cross each other on this.  There is no point in one Department teeing up a target if it is not being supported downstream.  <\/p> <p>  In one of the more positive examples, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs key indicators really do address some of those issues I and some of the other members have raised.  For example, if one is talking about women's involvement in the workplace, an associated key indicator is crucial.  In the case of some of the other Departments the approach is just too abstract.  The approaches give some interesting information but I do not see how they give us the policy change, or even the start of it, through this pilot programme.

Good afternoon on behalf of myself and my colleagues.  We are pleased to be back with the committee this afternoon to answer any further questions.  I refer to the petition that was signed by more than 10,000 candidates in advance of the 2017 junior certificate English examination and the subsequent appearance then of the petitioners before the committee in November.  The committee then raised a number of issues with ourselves for further response.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I am pleased to reiterate that the first examination of the revised junior certificate English examination took place last June.  We were pleased to report to the committee that the examination transacted just as we would have wished, in terms of the time allocation, the demand placed on candidates and the conduct of the examination itself.  We had taken steps prior to the examination, based on the petition, to make sure that would be the case.  We were pleased that transpired.  <\/p> <p>  The petitioners raised a number of issues in November.  The committee asked us to comment on those and we are happy to do that.  I will briefly mention what the issues were and then I will deal with them in turn.  The petitioners felt they had been passed from Department to Department and their concerns were not adequately addressed, so they contacted us directly in March 2017.<\/p><p>A day later we were in the position to confirm to the petitioners that all steps would be taken to make sure that the examination could be completed by candidates within the allotted two hour time and that the exam would be fair to candidates.  Subsequently, that turned out to be the case.  There was some further engagement from the petitioners following my initial response later in March.  Again, we replied a number of days later and reassured them of the particular situation.  I am pleased that we were able to give that level of reassurance to candidates in general, and not just the four petitioners, about the conduct of the examination. <\/p><p> The next topic that the petitioners raised, which the committee has asked us to comment on, was that they understood the key philosophy of the junior cycle examination would be that candidates would have the opportunity to carefully plan, draft and redraft their responses to questions.  In a response we set out that the assessment in the new junior cycle examination and framework is broader than what was traditionally the case.  In the past, the assessment of junior certificate English would have taken place over two terminal examinations in June.  Under the reformed junior cycle programme, assessment is much broader in terms of the planning of assessment and the requirement on candidates.  Assessment takes place over the full cycle as opposed to just the terminal examination at the end of third year.  The reason for this reform is twofold.  First, we want to reduce the focus on terminal examinations and the relentless preparation and attempts to maximise performance in the examination, which research has shown does impact on student learning.  There is now a focus on having assessments at various points over the course of the programme and giving feedback to students at the time.  All of that helps students to learn better.  We get feedback on how they perform and they learn how to improve their performance.  The change reduces the focus on purely a terminal examination.<\/p><p> In the context of junior cycle English, there are two classroom-based assessments at school level, which are marked by the teachers in accordance with the national guidelines issued by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  A broader suite of skills are tested by the school-based assessments than are tested in the final examination.  In third year there is a classroom-based assessment where students undertake a number of pieces of creative writing and submit two of them.  By way of preparation, they actively work on preparing, drafting, redrafting, finessing and finalising their pieces of creative writing, which leads up to the assessment event that takes place in the classroom and is marked by the teacher.  As a consequence, in the terminal examination set by the State Examination Commission, SEC, in June of third year, we do not have to ask students to respond to extended writing tasks.  We consider their application of knowledge and skills at a broader level than simply in terms of extended essay responses at that particular point.  That scenario is very much in line with the whole philosophy that underpins reform of the junior cycle reform.  The assessment has been designed to improve student learning and engagement with learning as opposed to just preparation for final examinations.<\/p><p> The third issue that petitioners raised, which the committee has asked us to comment on, is that the official sample papers were not consistent in structure, which meant that the mock examination papers did not reflect the final examination.  I can categorically state that the SEC is happy with the quality assurance measures that we have put in place, both in relation to the preparation and development of the sample paper and also with the final examination, that took place in June of last year.  We made sure that the examination could be undertaken within the allotted period, that it would test the syllabus objective and learning outcomes required in the syllabus specification for testing through that assessment, and it would be completed within the two hour timeline provided for the examination.  As I mentioned at the outset, we are very pleased that turned out to be the case because of the various steps that we had taken.<\/p><p> When there is a change of syllabus or specification, as it is now termed, or a brand new subject is introduced, students and teachers cannot rely on a previous suite of examination papers over a long number of years.  The purpose of sample papers is to assist teachers and students and, indeed, the providers of mock examinations and let them know the structure, style and format of the final examination.

Regarding interaction with and feedback from stakeholders, that happens every day in our day-to-day business in the delivery of the examinations.  Students are entered for the examinations through their schools.  In the Irish system and tradition schools take a strong advocacy role on behalf of their students and interact with us in terms of providing the national service in a strong advocacy way with regard to particular issues arising for individual candidates, class groupings or at a broader system level, if they see that as important.<\/p> <p>  We also engage with teachers through teacher unions and subject associations.  Immediately after every examination takes place in June we get feedback from the subject association for that particular subject.  There is also feedback organised through the national media.  There is a strong focus in Ireland on the examinations so there is a high level of reporting on them every year.  There might be a separate debate there regarding the stress levels that might generate, but there is that strong level of feedback to us and the examination system in terms of how students have encountered the particular examination, how they have experienced it and the professional educator's view on it.  That is important feedback for us because it helps us in framing the marking scheme that will ultimately be applied to students' work.  In the Irish context we do not pre-set examination questions and pre-test them in advance of the examinations whereby we can test the standard of questions or how students will respond to them.  Our question setters will have an expectation of how students will respond to a particular test item but that can change in terms of what actually happens in the examination hall.  There can be a different experience.  We get feedback from the individual teachers, the expert teachers operating through the media and through the subject associations.  We will often get feedback directly from candidates or their parents if the candidates have had a particularly nervous or upsetting experience during the examination.

This was decided by the Government of the day when it established the commission in 2003.  In setting up a separate body to run the State examinations body, the then Government examined the structure of other boards in education and broader civic society.  Unlike, for example, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, which is a representative and advisory council that includes representatives from third level interests, school management, school teachers, educationalists, industry and so forth, the State Examinations Commission is a delivery body.  Our responsibility is to operate and deliver the State examinations system.  The NCCA sets the policy, if one likes, the Minister then determines what will be the policy and our role is to deliver and operate that.<\/p> <p>  I understand that at the time of the commission's establishment, the Government of the day was strongly of the view that the role of the board was to provide oversight on behalf of the population regarding the conduct of State examinations.  It was not intended to be a body representing particular sectoral interests, especially in the area of examinations.  The board needed to be separate from that in terms of providing assurance and reassurance to the population on the conduct of what is regarded as a very important national educational service.  For this reason, representative groups do not nominate members of the board.  The Minister makes nominations to Cabinet which then determines who will be the five members of the board.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018022100002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1519219800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before the joint committee and addressing our concerns.

I will then address the junior cycle because it differs significantly from the leaving cycle.  Leaving certificate subjects are revised on a rolling basis by the NCCA.<\/p><p>It has certainly been the practice and policy over the past long number of years that when subjects are being revised we moved from a system of the traditional three hour terminal exam in June, which was the only assessment element where the person is tested on a written paper, to a system with project work, course work or skills-based activities in which we set out to assess a broader range of skills and knowledge than we can assess in a written examination.  In practical subjects it can be determined by asking the student to design a communication graphic using CAD systems, or if the subject is construction or engineering the student may be asked to make an artefact, or in language subjects the student is given aural and oral exams as well as written exams.  The idea is that the student is tested on a broader range of skills than was the case traditionally, and it also allows the student to bank some assessment activity separate to the three hour examination in June.  This reduces the stress levels that are, in the case of the leaving certificate, undoubtedly part of the high-stakes examination.<\/p><p> The reform process around the junior cycle is fundamentally quite different.  Research has shown that focusing on the terminal examination system at the end of third year does not encourage the sort of learning that we hope to develop as a society moving in to the 21st century.  There is a broader range of assessment and reporting to students and parents in relation to the junior cycle than is possible through an external model such as the one operated in the State examinations system.  Classroom-based assessments are now happening at school whereby students can be assessed on a broad range of skills and upon which they can get feedback at the time.  Students learn better when they get feedback at the point of assessment and at the point of learning, on how they are performing and where they can improve, as opposed of feedback at the end of the third year.  The research at junior cycle, in the context of performance in English and Maths, has shown us that students are stabilising in first year with some students then disengaging in second year.  Traditionally a lot of the focus in third year, especially from Christmas term onwards, was on preparation for the examinations.  In many respects it was preparation for performance in the examinations as opposed to developing a deeper learning and engagement with the subjects.  The research shows that the skills set is trying to encourage in students a deeper engagement in learning with their schools and teachers that is broader than the system as a whole and broader than the exam system.  Research shows that this is possible through a broader range of assessment, through feedback and through formation than is possible through a terminal, external model.  That is very much the focus there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018022100002#E01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519219800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Farrell very much for that comprehensive response.

I will tell the committee why.  In the past, I believe that many students failed an exam because they just could not face the stress of questions and trying to put the answers together.  Assessments, however, gives them an opportunity to excel and many of them do excel in that area.  We all accept that students need to do some written work.  Written work is very good, but assessment gives a fair chance to the students who may not be able to handle sitting an exam for two or two and a half hours to try to answer.  There are a considerable number of such students.  It causes them a lot of stress.  The assessments are really good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018022100002#F00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1519219800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>There has to be some deconstruction of the thinking that existed heretofore where everything was geared towards the terminal exam.  It is quite a struggle for many schools to try to deconstruct the pedagogical element and the content aspect of this.  Where a school was geared towards trying to squeeze as much as possible in to the terminal exam, it was in the confined space of time because they were getting the desired points or desired results for the onward trajectory towards third level institutions and so on.  The previous junior cycle was part of that trajectory or continuum.  Maybe some schools continue to struggle in this regard.  I do not refer specifically to Loreto College, which generated this petition, but maybe some challenges remain in the system around trying to deconstruct some of that thinking.  This gives voice to petitions of this nature, and I speak in general terms.<\/p> <p>  The committee has heard absolutely compelling evidence here today.  By any reasonable or objective analysis, the witnesses have given a very robust account of the nature of the correspondence entered into with the petitioners and have engaged willingly and openly with the petitioners.  The witnesses have answered all of the questions on the time challenge.  The research and qualitative analysis carried out clearly shows that the time was not such an issue as it related to last year's English exam and that people were able to get to the questions in a timely fashion.  I believe the committee members are in agreement with that analysis.<\/p> <p>  The procedures in place for individual students to interface with the State Examinations Commission are robust; in this instance in this exam, there were only four people in the State who made a complaint about the time element out of 60,000 students who sat the same exam - and protecting their anonymity I assume they were not four individuals from one school and that they represent a wider geographical spread.  The vast majority of students who took the exam were satisfied about the time constraints under which they were operating.  I believe this to be a fair assessment.<\/p> <p>  Having regard to the evidence submitted to the committee by the State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education and Skills the committee deems it appropriate to close the petition and to send a copy of the submission made by the State Examinations Commission and the Department to the petitioners.  The committee will thank the petitioners for their engagement with the committee.  On behalf of the committee members, I express my gratitude to the witnesses for coming before the committee today.  We strayed in to other areas also, but it was very useful to engage with the witnesses because it is helpful to members, as parliamentarians, to understand the dynamics of the State Examinations Commission and the Department on the exam structures.  It was a useful tutorial for us and we are grateful for it.

On behalf of the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group, I am accompanied by members as introduced, Professor Joe Carthy, Mr. Ronan Lupton and Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch.  We had apologies due to prior commitments from Dr. Mary Aiken and Ms Kate O'Sullivan, members of our group who were unable to attend today.<\/p> <p>  Our group was convened on the invitation of former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte, to advise on matters of Internet content governance and to respond to issues of Internet safety arising from harmful communications.  We were invited today to discuss the pertinence and relevance of our report, which is dated 2014.  Our work was time-limited and the group formally ceased its function on delivery but we feel that there is ongoing relevance in the recommendations based on our assessment of the needs for Internet safety provision, strengthening, enhancement and reinforcement.  We were an expert group, comprising members from academia, legal professions, children's charities and industry, and consulted across all of those sectors in the work that we undertook.  Our work was guided by specific terms of reference and key principles.<\/p> <p>  In the interests of time, I will paraphrase some key issues contained in my opening statement.  I emphasise that our work focuses on issues relating to content governance as opposed to regulation.  We detail in our work the multiplicity of strategies that need to be in place to ensure and strengthen children's online safety.  We address other matters too but that governance dimension underpins the recommendations that we made.  Our approach was holistic.  We attempted to be comprehensive in the recommendations being made because it is difficult to isolate specific instances of vulnerability for children online without addressing the holistic environment within which that happens.  In that context, as informed by best international practice, we sought to balance the various competing rights and responsibilities of different actors and the varying dimensions of freedom of expression and the importance of protection as well as provision for children online.  Those are the underlying principles which informed our work as we attempted to put forward recommendations relating to the arena of State investment and support for children's online engagement.  We also detail the variety of different stakeholders and actors who have a role and responsibility to play.  If our recommendations were focused towards specific Government Departments, where we believed that they should take a leadership role, this also entailed actions on the part of other stakeholders, notably industry, civil society, parents and indeed children and young people themselves.  They are active agents and citizens in their own right, participating in the online environment, and they have responsibilities.<\/p> <p>  I will outline our recommendations with regard to the fundamentals of what we believe to be the hallmarks of best international practice.  There are three key layers.  I describe it diagrammatically in the report.  We should be able to identify these in how any modern state provides for and attends to the needs of young people.  One is that governance layer, having a tangible point of direct responsibility.  Who takes the lead in the management and co-ordination of children's online safety?  That is a fundamental question which needs to be answered and which we addressed in our report.  We described that as a fundamental layer.  We put a name on it.  We argued for the creation of a national council for children's online safety.  This closely approximates the UK Council for Child Internet Safety which has also looked at arrangements in Ireland over the course of the years with regard to how this has developed.  It is vitally important in that layer that the space is created for all those partners and stakeholders to participate.  There has to be a forum where they are accountable and make a contribution to supporting children's safety.<\/p> <p>  The second dimension relates to policy development.  This is a fast-moving area.  Technologies change.  We look at potential risks and challenges of which we are still unaware.  One has to have the ability to respond.  It is not easy to come up with a single solution at a point in time that will be sufficiently robust to still be relevant a year afterwards.  That is the policy development layer.<\/p><p>We are conscious that in the succeeding session three Ministers will appear, each representing Departments that have a primary role in contributing to a holistic approach towards policy development.  We comment on that in our report.<\/p><p> The third aspect is a public-facing body.  This is important for all citizens, including children, young people, parents, carers and teachers.  Such a body would address important questions.  Where is my go-to place?  Where do I find trusted definitive advice and support for online safety for children?  We address this area in the report.  We looked to the enhancement of the Irish Safer Internet Centre, which is a long-standing project.  We believe it has not been well-resourced.  Such organisations play significant roles in all European member states.  These centres operate on the basis of partnership with the European Commission and member states in providing education, awareness, support and contact with stakeholders, including those from the industry.  They provide a hotline and a helpline.  Ensuring the visibility and accessibility of these services to citizens is vital.<\/p><p> In a nutshell, that is the content of the recommendations.  They are set out clearly in three levels.  We need policy.  We need a public-facing stakeholder forum, where there is accountability and transparency and where the key actors are around the table to make appropriate decisions.  We need public support and service delivery in terms of reinforcing the safety of children.<\/p><p> We delivered our recommendations in good faith.  We had a short timeframe to develop matters of public concern in 2014.  These matters do not go away - the concerns remain.  We took the view that our recommendations could add value and provide much-needed visibility for public provision.<\/p><p> We know the matters before the committee are of ongoing concern.  There is eagerness to find ready solutions.  We have portrayed our solutions in that holistic sense.  The debate will continue.<\/p><p> We held discussions in preparation for the discussion today.  It was not an issue for us in 2014, but the digital age of consent is a feature of the general data protection regulation.  It is not in itself an instrument for children's online safety.  It is fundamentally a matter of data protection.  However, we support affirming the decision to set the age at 13 years.  We believe increasing the age to 16 years does nothing for children's Internet safety.  It is not a matter of safety of itself.  In fact, it could cause unintended consequences and further exposure to risks for children who are not otherwise covered by appropriate privacy protection and who are not availing of or the subject of specific Internet safety protection as active social media users.  It is important to bring this up to a contemporary point in the sense of where we are currently.  These debates will be ongoing but a fundamental contribution is needed.  It must be flexible, robust and respond to current and future challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Thank you, Professor.

I should point out as well that our work coincided and overlapped with the Law Reform Commission.  That fact acted as one of the constraints on us because we were given a tight timeframe.  We were aware that the Law Reform Commission had longer to consider it.  The commission extended its process to the end of 2015.<\/p> <p>  Again, it was not a matter for us.  This is an indication of how fast these questions develop.  The Harmful Digital Communications Bill was in development in New Zealand at that time.  There was no active proposal in Australia, which has since provided the model.  It was later in the day when the Law Reform Commission made that recommendation.  We supported several of the recommendations.  We discussed them actively with the Law Reform Commission in the development of the report.  Specifically, in respect of the digital safety commissioner, in my previous appearance before the committee I mentioned that the recommendations are not entirely incompatible.  There are differences because they extend in different dimensions.  Work on the establishment of any office that might be called a digital safety commissioner or something similar will be required to implement the recommendations we have set out.  It was similar in the case of the Australian Office of the eSafety Commissioner.  In Australia the office was an extension and it grew out of the communications regulator and that regulatory arena.  The regulator there has had extensive dealings with the broadcasting arena, children's content and children's advertising and has been able to draw on that experience.

Can Professor O'Neill understand that some of us are fearful of keeping it at 13 years and not increasing it to 16 years?  We fear that if a child at the age of 13 years is yielding all this information to an unknown entity, then that information can be used for all manner of nefarious reasons.

Realistically, by setting the age at 16 years, we drive a set of activity underground in a way that would be impossible to contend with.  Neither is it a good signal to suggest parental responsibility is a matter of signing consent.

I will start with the process involved in arriving at the age of 13 about which I have concerns.  Nobody has given me confidence about the age of 13.  Why not 14 or 15?  The reason I am concerned is because there are many 13 year olds who are not mature enough.  I and all members of the committee are in favour of empowering children.  We are talking about giving children rights at 13 years of age.  The comment about the photo amounts to removing a right from a parent.  As the parent of a 13-year old child, I am being told that my child has the right to put up a provocative photo of herself but as her parent, I have no right to remove that.

I believe the issue of safety for children engaging in online activity presents a very serious challenge.  Protecting children from online abuse, bullying, grooming and sites with harmful content requires a whole-of-government approach.  While the Internet is not age-bound and the risks and dangers apply to people of all ages, children are particularly vulnerable and need greater protection.<\/p> <p>  I share the concerns about the importance of enhancing cybersecurity, particularly for vulnerable groups.  That includes children and young people but getting this right is a big challenge for Governments worldwide.  However, the challenges are not just for Government.  They are for all of society.  There is also a role for parents, children and industry.<\/p> <p>  The Internet operates across borders.  The challenges we meet often arise from decisions taken outside our jurisdiction.  However, we have the advantage that many of the world&rsquo;s leading technology companies have a significant corporate presence here in Ireland.  I believe they can and must work with Government.<\/p> <p>  I believe that we must link responsibility for child welfare and protection with the provision of services.  In any setting where children are involved, the provider of the service must be aware of the possible risks to children.  They must try to reduce these risks as much as possible.  We must embed responsibility for child welfare and protection in all our services to children.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that many Departments are already doing great work, more of which we will hear about shortly, but we need to collaborate more on that.<\/p><p>We need a truly joined-up approach.  For example, dealing with the criminal behaviour associated with the Internet is a matter for my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, at the Department of Justice and Equality; facilitating technology is the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and his Department; the Department of Education and Skills plays a valuable role in Internet safety in schools; and the Department of Health has a particular interest in children's health and well-being.  This is critical as well.<br\/><br\/>My own Department has a role to play.  Child protection is our mission.  We must not and do not distinguish between online and offline communities.  We have reached a key moment for child protection in this country.  Mandatory reporting of abuse is a reality.  Every organisation working with young people must from next month compile and publish a child safety statement, while the budget of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is passing &euro;750 million for the first time.  These are concrete steps.  They offer protections to our young people in all environments, including online.<br\/><br\/>I am also very concerned that the voices of children and young people will be heard and acted upon when we make decisions on Internet safety.  Without their input, perspectives and knowledge, our policies simply will not work.  My Department has overall policy responsibility for ensuring that the voices of children and young people are heard on decisions that affect their lives.  We undertake and support consultation in this regard.  We have been developing structures to enable participation in decision-making by children.  These structures include D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  The committee recently met groups of young people from the Comhairle.  I believe they were pretty powerful, as young people often are.  As I said earlier today, it is only through engagement with young people that we can find the solutions that will work.  The consultation with Wicklow Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, as the committee knows, produced a charter on cyberbullying.  The charter makes requests of us all.  It asks that we have a plan for dealing with cyberbullying and that we protect children and their rights and well-being.  The charter speaks to bullies, those being bullied, bystanders and all young people.  While this initiative is local to Wicklow, the message from young people can be considered more widely.  Technology <i>per se<\/i>is not the problem; people's behaviour is the problem.  The committee also met with Clare Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and heard of its very successful initiative with McAfee which has resulted in a cybersafety programme rolling out not only throughout Ireland, but also internationally.  These initiatives developed by young people are real examples of finding local solutions to our problems here and beyond our shores.<br\/><br\/>My colleagues will talk about actions in which they are engaged that are relevant to their Departments.  I warmly welcome the recent announcement by the Minister, Deputy Naughten, of his open policy debate on 8 March.  This will involve a range of Departments, not just those present.  Everyone wants to figure out how to get this right and wants to help.  We are particularly appreciative of the committee's work.  Last November I met the Ministers, Deputies Naughten and Flanagan, to discuss the cross-Government collaboration that is needed.  A lot of work is being done by individual Departments and by officials at a higher level working together.  However, we need to develop an action plan involving all relevant Departments in order that our actions are co-ordinated, complementary and robust.  I am committed to playing my part in this regard.<br\/><br\/>How am I doing for time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#G02000","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>The Minister's time is up, I am afraid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#H00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I had a sense of that.

To the best of my recollection, this is the first time an Oireachtas committee has had four Cabinet Ministers before it at the one time, which just shows how seriously we are all taking this issue.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the work it has carried out since last September on the issue of online safety.  Since my appointment as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I have impressed upon my officials that online safety, particularly for children, is a personal priority for me.  It is also a priority for me as a father of four young children.  We all know that the Internet is a tool that brings enormous benefits, but there are also risks and dangers that combine anonymity and distance too easily.  These types of risks vary enormously from the most serious criminal content, such as child sexual abuse material at one end of the spectrum, to legal but abusive, hurtful or defamatory comments at the other end.  The perpetrators similarly vary from criminals to ordinary users, some of whom are young people themselves.  Given the range of different material, no single action will \"fix the Internet\".  There is a lot of work being done across a range of Government Departments in this area, but we need to communicate and co-ordinate our work better.  We need to demonstrate a much more joined-up Government approach to online safety to every single citizen.  We can never be complacent in this area.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the implementation of the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group Report, which was published in 2014, progress, as we know, has been slow.  Even though it was published in May 2014, I believe the overall thrust of the report's recommendations is still valid today.  A key goal of the report's recommendations was to have effective structures in place in order to ensure a joined-up approach across Government and engagement with parents, industry, voluntary groups and other agencies.  This is exactly why I am holding an open policy debate forum on 8 March at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham to bring together the main players in this sphere in order to move in that one direction.  This committee has highlighted and given a voice to many organisations, groups and individuals that are all working day in, day out to ensure our children, and all users, are safe and protected when online.  We need to tap into this commitment and expertise on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>  My own Department has direct responsibility for implementing the revisions to the audiovisual media services directive.  While a final text is yet to be agreed at European level, the directive will ensure that video sharing platform services such as YouTube have measures in place to protect users, especially minors, from harmful video content.  We expect the revised directive to be agreed in the coming months and will then begin a public consultation on how best to implement its provisions in Ireland.  It is vital we get this right.  I recently met Google's vice president for public policy, Nicklas Lundblad, who told me that 500 hours of video content is uploaded to YouTube every single minute.  This is a staggering fact.<\/p> <p>  My position on the need to establish an office of digital safety commissioner has been widely reported and acknowledged.  Many parents, agencies and NGOs share my position.  For the role to be effective and responsive to modern-day needs in the constant fast-paced world of the Internet, we need to move together as an Oireachtas on this specific issue.  As the committee knows, the Government will respond tomorrow to the Private Members' Bill on a digital safety commissioner tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Government will not oppose the Bill.  There are aspects of the Bill as presented, however, that will need closer examination and scrutiny in order for the role to be defined as we need it to be defined, with effective powers and responsibilities.  I look forward to the debate and working with my colleagues on the committee.  Online safety is complex, but some of the solutions are clear.  We need to do more but we also need to ensure there is greater awareness of all the resources and supports that are available right now.  We want to ensure that our children are not only tech-savvy, but also safety-conscious, that our parents know where they can turn to for help, and that there is a joined-up approach to everything we do.  These are measures that can be strengthened in the shorter term without waiting for legislation.<\/p> <p>  As I have outlined, a number of Government Departments and agencies are already involved in delivering many services which are aimed at safeguarding citizens online.  Rather than being overly prescriptive in this area, I am keen to work on practical steps we can take now in the short term.  This means working with parents, young people, NGOs and the tech companies to take actions that can make a real difference.  I convened a meeting between my colleagues, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, last November on this issue.  We have agreed that the most appropriate way to move online safety forward would be to hold an open policy debate to help us identify the gaps and the practical steps needed to fill them.<\/p><p>Six Government Departments, led by my Department, are involved in organising it.  The overall aim of this event is to raise awareness among the participants of the activities that are being undertaken by the Irish Government, the European Commission, industry and NGOs in this area.  The ideas and feedback generated on this day will also feed into a Government action plan which will underpin future actions and policies.<\/p><p> Committee members have all been invited to attend on the day.  I hope that we can answer the questions that this committee has raised and that we can work together as an Oireachtas to progress these issues in a responsive way that deals with the challenges ahead.  The Internet is changing on a daily basis and we need to act quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#H00400","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.

I agree with Deputy Naughten's comment that it is without precedent to have four Cabinet Ministers attending an Oireachtas committee meeting.  This serves to underline the importance of the subject matter and it also acknowledges the importance of this committee, its influence and authority on this most important issue.<\/p><p>My Department deals with the criminal and legal aspects of Internet safety.  We have strong laws to protect children and last year we introduced new offences to target child exploitation.  The key criminal justice Acts in this area are the Child Trafficking and Pornography Acts 1998 to 2004.  The existing law was amended by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 to enable a number of new offences to be added to combat the exploitation of children and, in particular, to address the use of modern communications technologies as a tool which may lead to child exploitation.  Separately, heads of a Bill are currently being prepared in my Department to address specific criminal legislative recommendations that were set out in the Law Reform Commission's 2016 report on harmful communications and digital safety.  The commission has proposed extending some existing offences and creating some new criminal offences. <\/p><p>My Department is responsible for criminal justice legislation while An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responsible for ensuring the law is upheld.  As part of the Garda modernisation and renewal programme there is significant focus on emerging threats, one of which is online child sexual exploitation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responding to this challenge in a variety of ways including through the online child exploitation unit at the Garda national protection services bureau.  Within the child protection unit at the Garda national protection services bureau, a new unit staffed by specialist personnel has been created which is tasked with the identification of online victims of exploitation. <\/p><p>Last October, Assistant Commissioner John O&rsquo;Driscoll and his colleagues had a lengthy discussion with this committee on these issues.  In recent weeks we have seen some of the successes of Operation Ketch which is targeting those possessing and distributing child exploitation material.  In early February, Operation Ketch led to searches of 31 homes in 12 counties across the State and the seizure of computers, phones, laptops and other equipment with tens of thousands of images of child pornography.  During this phase of the investigation, searches were carried out under warrant pursuant to the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 across a number of Garda divisions.  The searches were carried out by newly-established divisional protection service units and local detective units.  I want to acknowledge the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard.  I must also point out that this is not just a national endeavour.  There is a high level of co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, other international police services, Interpol and Europol.  <\/p><p>Alongside these criminal justice aspects my Department, in common with a number of other Departments, has a role in promoting Internet safety.  The office for Internet safety in my Department coordinates the EU safer Internet programme for Ireland and channels EU funding to four partner bodies who in turn provide relevant Internet safety awareness raising, helpline and take down services.  That office oversees the work of <i>Hotline.ie<\/i>and the Garda blocking initiative in the context of an EU directive on combatting the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.  It has also developed Internet safety awareness material by working with its advisory body.  Many committee members will have received copies of those information booklets in recent months. <\/p><p>My colleague, Deputy Denis Naughten, has an important role to play in this area and together with the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills, Deputies Zappone and Bruton, we are working to ensure that the various initiatives in Government have as much impact as possible.  Part of this work involves the open policy debate which is scheduled to take place on 8 March 2018 to which Deputy Naughten already referred.  The key objectives of that debate will be to raise awareness of cross-departmental actions already taking place to deal with harmful online content, to identify any possible gaps in the Government's approach and the steps needed to address these.  I acknowledge the importance of this committee in this area and assure members that any reports, observations or submissions made by the committee will be taken very seriously by my Department.  I know that I speak for my Cabinet colleagues in that regard.  The emphasis in the open policy debate will be on children and young people.  Arising from that event it is anticipated that a whole-of-Government approach to this issue can be formulated and advanced. <\/p><p>Committee members will have noted from the wide range of contributions that have been made to date that the issue of cybersecurity for all and, in particular, for children and young people is a difficult one in the fast moving and vast arena that is modern communications.  My colleagues and I are anxious to make progress while harnessing the best available information, expertise and experience.  In that regard, I look forward to working closely with this committee and to receiving its report on this matter.  I have no doubt that we will have an opportunity to meet again later in the year to monitor progress.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#J00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his contribution and now call on the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#J00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for their invitation to attend.  I will not make any quips about waiting all day for a bus because in this case it is absolutely justified to have four buses come along at once.  In the submission that has been circulated I point out that one of the things that my Department is increasingly emphasising is well-being within the whole education system.  In the policy being rolled out in schools well-being is defined in the context of young citizens as discerning, respectful, resilient, connected, confident, positive and imaginative, which are all things that we want for our children.  The normal concerns that any parent would have about their children meeting strangers, being bullied, getting in with the wrong crowd or getting involved in harmful activities are all turbo charged by the power of new technologies and the Internet.  While digital technology brings phenomenal benefits in education it also gives rise to risks to which we must be very alert.  It is a very fast-moving area, as Deputy Flanagan has said, and we must always be vigilant and review our policies regularly.<\/p><p>In general terms, schools have independent boards which are responsible for ensuring the safe use of digital technology in schools.  It is up to school boards and management to have the appropriate policies in place.  That said, we do not leave them adrift on an ocean but provide them with a lot of support.  As is outlined in my written submission, support is provided in the areas of formal curriculum content and the continuous professional development of teachers.  Very innovative material is provided by <i>webwise.ie<\/i>, representatives of which are here today.  This material is delivered to students, parents and teachers.  Network services are provided to support security and filtering.  We also provide strong policy content and guidance in areas like well being, digital technologies and anti-bullying strategies.<\/p><p>Members will be familiar with recent curriculum changes, including the new well-being programme which is being rolled out at junior cycle level.  This programme integrates the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum with the political and civil education curriculum.<\/p><p>It is designed to ensure people are strong in themselves but also respectful of others.  Much of the context of that is to give people the tools to manage their own interaction either with technology or with others.  The junior cycle now provides for short courses allowing young people to dip into things like digital media literacy which gives them an exposure if they choose.  The NCCA continually reviews the curriculum with a view to improving it and making it more relevant.  There is considerable activity in ensuring the curriculum is attuned to students' needs.<\/p><p> We have support for teachers in technology in well-being and specific support through Webwise.  I have listed some of the instruments they have in the field.  One of them, Be in Ctrl, was launched relatively recently.  It is a good example.  The Garda supported the programme and was involved in putting it together.  We had 80 student ambassadors who went back to the schools to popularise it and reinterpret the advice into ways that it would be better absorbed and acted upon in their schools and taking initiatives in schools.  They are all in relevant areas.  They include Be in Ctrl, acceptable usage policy, Think B4U Click, advice for parents about sexting and so on.  They are all very relevant to the topic we are discussing.<\/p><p> Obviously we have an action plan for bullying.  Schools must have an anti-bullying policy.  There has to be an acceptable usage policy in schools setting out the dos and don'ts of how technology should be used and the consequences of abuses of that.<\/p><p> I am not saying we are perfect by any means, but I think we have the ingredients to react in an evolving way to the changes that are sought by the committee or by colleagues.  I welcome the bringing together of the various strands because we cannot work in a silo without knowledge of the source of the criminal threats and where the technology is heading.  We are very keen to be part of this cross-Government approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#J00500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>As everybody needs the opportunity to ask questions, I ask that members stick to the five-minute rule and use those five minutes for questions rather than statements.

Which of the Ministers present will have responsibility for the digital safety commissioner when that office is established?  We need a clear unambiguous answer to that question.  The Internet content governance advisory group was constituted in 2013.  One of its recommendations was that there would be a specific senior or junior Minister responsible.  We need to find out who has political responsibility for online safety.<\/p> <p>  My second question is for the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Assistant Garda Commissioner O'Driscoll, and Mr. Declan Daly appeared before the committee in October.  They told us that fewer than 100 Garda personnel were involved in the Garda national protective services bureau and under that the online child exploitation unit.  They give us clear figures on the number of personnel, but it amounts to fewer than 100 people, if civilians are included.  If we are talking about cybercrime and the protection of children and minors, we need to better resource the Garda national protective services bureau.  Having additional numbers there would go a long way to the cause of protecting children effectively.<\/p> <p>  We were all disgusted by the Horan case.  The initial inquiry on that case came from an American intervention on a Gmail account.  That set off a chain of events in the investigation.  Had that email not come from the authorities in America or had there not been an intervention on that, the Horan case might not have come to light.  I speak about resources specifically in that case.<\/p> <p>  I know the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, is a very strong advocate of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  We are all very supportive of the STEM initiatives in the junior and senior cycles and the short courses in the junior cycle.  Some parents argue that it is the responsibility of the schools to look after online safety - to teach the children or young adults well so to speak.  Insufficient resources are allocated to PDST.  We need more resources for PDST because the translational effect is not happening in every school and we need to reach beyond post primary and right down into primary level.  We need to educate teachers and make them online safety advocates.  We should appoint an online safety advocate in every school or region so that they can deploy a lot of these resources in teaching across regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#K00300","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>To whom is the Deputy's first question on responsibility directed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#K00400","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>As it is a technological issue, I would start with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#K00500","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to answer the first part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#K00600","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>In answer to the question as to who has responsibility for online safety, at the moment it crosses six Departments.

This is the type of discussion taking place across a range of Departments and it is one that will be very much informed by the open policy debate that will take place in March and the report of the joint committee once it has been completed.<\/p> <p>  On Garda resources, Deputy Sherlock is correct that the success of any initiative can be measured and gauged by the resources available for its work.  I will not discuss again any issue that has been raised in the joint committee during its meeting with Assistant Commissioner John O'Driscoll.  There are new and exciting developments in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which keep pace with international technological advances in this area.  I refer to the sex crime management unit, the online child exploitation unit, the national child protection unit, the sex offender management and intelligence unit and the human trafficking investigation and co-ordination unit.  I assure Deputy Sherlock and other members that the Garda is very much engaged with international police forces and other actors in this area.  I cite in particular the relationship with Canada and across Europe through Interpol. <\/p> <p>  In terms of resources, unprecedented levels of resources were made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the most recent budget when a facilitation was made for an additional 800 recruits to the force.  I visited Templemore before Christmas to witness the attestation of more than 200 garda&iacute;.  The aim of the Government is to ensure we have a Garda service of 21,000 members by 2021.  I do not decide on the distribution of personnel in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as I am sure Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll will have informed the joint committee.  I provide resources and legislative back-up, both of which roles are important in the context of the committee's engagement this morning.  Members can be assured that, as further resources are rolled out to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they will be allocated towards these important units and offices. <\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of training.  I am pleased the Garda College at Templemore, which was closed for a number of years, is firmly reopened and developing new courses and expanding others, many in conjunction with the University of Limerick at the highest level of technological advancement.  I will be happy to continue to engage with the Garda Commissioner on the issue of the distribution of personnel.

While I do not contest the case made and I accept that teachers are important, students and parents are also very important.  We have this built into the webwise.ie activity targeting parents.  As I described, the student ambassadors probably have as much leverage as teachers in the school community - it is certainly significant.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of providing more resources for training teachers, I will conduct a review this year to ascertain how well we execute the upskilling of teachers after they qualify, the resources invested, the way in which they are deployed and whether they are strategically deployed.  I will work on the review during 2018.<\/p> <p>  We have 20 people working in support and well-being and a further 20 people working in Internet technology.  These staff have approximately 45,000 teacher contacts in terms of training units delivered across well-being and Internet safety.  There is, therefore, a reasonable level of activity in this area, although I would not argue against increasing it following our review.<\/p> <p>  We need to have digital leaders in every school.  We are piloting clusters and these have generated significant interest.  Online safety is probably part of the overall use of digital in the school rather than a segmented role that is different from digital in the school.  It is digital citizenship, if one likes. <\/p> <p>  A digital framework is being piloted in 50 schools.

Speaking at a previous meeting of the joint committee, Mr. Ronan Lupton, a member of the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group, outlined some interesting ideas to which I had not given much thought, although they were set out in the report.  For example, he suggested that the digital safety commissioner come within the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach.  This would mean the Taoiseach would appoint a Minister of State with responsibility for the digital age, the Internet or whichever title one wished to give the Minister.  Given the prevalence of the Internet in society, the way in which adults and children conduct themselves online and the safety issues that arise, is it not necessary to implement this proposal?  As far as I am concerned, it is the only show in town.  We could spend a full day discussing the age of consent, banning telephones and so forth but the issue is one of developing a framework.

I do not believe that we can close out technology and not come to terms with it.  The jury is out on whether or not a ban is the way to come to terms with the issue.  Technically it is up to each school and this is not a bad approach.  There would be issues around banning phones.  The teachers' unions raised a concern about enforcement.  If a ban is introduced, how will schools enforce it?  What does this do for the other relationships they are trying to foster within the schools?  While I do not have a closed mind on this, I believe that the current way of a school looking and deciding what is right for its community, its time and the way it runs its appropriate use policies and so on is the appropriate way for the time being.  We are, however, open to discussion.<\/p> <p>  Well-being comes under the social, personal and health education module which goes right up through primary school level, and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is reviewing the primary curriculum from top to bottom.  In particular it is looking at the transition from preschool to primary school and from primary school to second level school, and at how the content should be structured, bearing in mind the journey a child is taking.

I am not sure how successful it has been.  I believe the jury is still out on that.  Some people say that bringing one's own technology into the classroom is not a bad element.

The default position becomes one where some people are not allowed access to everything but some people can opt in to other access options.  I believe that a measure like this would work very well in schools and in homes.  Many parents are knowledgeable about Internet safety but many others would need a bit of a hand.

There is a lot of very good work going on in Education and Skills.  It is one of the most innovative Departments in this area, not just in Ireland but also across Europe.  We can learn a lot from what is going on in our schools and we need to bring this out to the community.  I spoke to a parent this morning who gave me an example of the transition year students in St. Colmcille's community school in Knocklyon.  They have taken what is going on in the classroom and in the school and they have educated the parents of the pupils around what is available for blocking and so on.  I took this issue up with Google management when they were in Dublin recently.  They have developed the family link project within Google that does this very thing.  It provides the facility to give control to parents around what they will and will not allow their children to access online.  We have to use technology.  The tools are there.

As a result of the open policy debate and some of the outcomes from that, I intend to present to children and young people in an open event, possibly in the early summer and that would be geographically represented, the structures our Department has developed, what the adults have deliberated on, and ask the children and young people what they think of it.

I am aware that the Mission Possible programme is being rolled out based on demographic needs in a couple of schools in Dublin, with St. James's primary school in Dublin 8 being one.  Will the Minister consider rolling out this programme in its entirety when he reviews it?  This programme has a lot of good and proven points, and the research has pointed to how it has impacted and created well-being and resilience in very young children.<\/p> <p>  The precedent of getting four Ministers to this committee table really speaks volumes about the need for a Minister for digital safety.  This sort of meeting cannot keep happening.  The Ministers currently present may not be available.  Perhaps we could discuss this further at the open dialogue forum on International Women's Day.  I thank the Minister for the invite.  It is a great idea to cross reference it with our children who are the subject of all of this.  It is to be hoped we can meet together and come to a consensus, because if children feel their views are being included, as opposed to being dictated to by oldies, they will feel a lot more ownership of any measures.<\/p> <p>  It is nice to hear that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, will be generally supportive of Sinn F&eacute;in's Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017.  That is rare enough but it is good to see it will occur.  We do not drop the ball, we just keep it going.  It was discussed by witnesses who were in before the committee just before the Ministers.

The answer was not one.<\/p> <p>  When Mr. Lupton says he wants this to go to a particular Department or Minister, am I to read between the lines that there has been a lack of co-operation since 2014 within Departments, or is this a positive way forward to focus on the Internet, having one person completely responsible for spearheading this?  I appreciate that some Ministers may not have been in office in 2014 but why has it not happened since then?

It is a question of education in the widest possible sense and exploiting the technological tools we have.  We need always to be very conscious of that.  We need a legislative framework as well.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Rabbitte, approximately 50% of those recommendations are being progressed.  There are a wide range of recommendations, for example, regulation of online platforms which will be dealt with through the audiovisual media services directive, AVMS, and those discussions are going on at EU level.  That directive will bring in regulation for video sharing platforms such as YouTube, RT&Eacute; Player and so forth, and for on-demand services.  At the moment the timeline is that they will be finalised by May, then we will go to public consultation.  We have a good idea of how we will structure that but we want to consult on it first.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 50 of the recommendations concern the transfer of functions, mainly from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Many of the recommendations are valid today.  It is natural for a Department to draw line between its role and that of another Department.  We must overcome these issues given the seriousness of the subject.  That is why four of the six relevant Ministers are here today and why the six Departments are working together on this open policy forum to come forward with an action plan.  When the present Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Bruton, was Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, he brought forward an action plan that went right across Government to drive the economy forward.  We are now virtually at full employment on foot of that work.  We need a similar mechanism to deliver on the objectives which we all have and on which we all agree.

One is the criminal aspect, and the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, outlined to Cabinet that she was proceeding with legislation.  The present Minister, Deputy Flanagan, spoke about that here earlier.  The other aspect was the digital safety commissioner.  The agreement of Cabinet at the time was to have a Cabinet sub-committee and senior officials group work on that.  The Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and for Justice and Equality and I met last November to see how we could progress and move this agenda forward, not just in respect of the Law Reform Commission report but also in respect of the previous report, the ICGA report.  On foot of that we agreed to establish this forum to take place on 8 March to bring all the players together because there are many aspects to this.  Some of what is in that ICGA report is being acted upon at a European level and the implementation will come from EU directives.

If the Chair will allow, I will briefly give a little background or the processing involved in arriving at a digital age of consent.  The issue is more than just age.  It is the manner in which social media are being addressed by service providers themselves.  There is also the role of parents and, of course, the rights, or otherwise, of the user.<\/p> <p>  Currently, there is no digital age of consent in Ireland.  This is a new legal concept.  To prepare for our European framework, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, a consultation process was undertaken by the Government in November 2016.  My Department launched that process.  Submissions were invited from interested parties on the issue of the digital age of consent.  There was a comprehensive process of consultation which also fed into the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  A clear majority of those who responded, including the Ombudsman for Children, the Internet safety advisory committee and the Children's Rights Alliance, recommended to us that a digital age of consent be set at 13.  <\/p> <p> Based on that, the Government formed the view that 13 years of age represented an appropriate balancing of children's rights, children's right to participate online and the right to accord with international instruments such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The Government felt that if the age was to be higher than that, there would be real difficulties with enforcement. They would not be dissimilar to issues raised with the Minister of Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, in respect of the enforceability of restriction on the use of mobile phones in schools.  There are technologically savvy 13, 14 and 15 year olds.  IT literacy is particularly high.  <\/p> <p>  We listened to groups such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, Spunout, the Digital Youth Council and CyberSafeIreland.  In addition, I acknowledge the contribution of the Special Rapporteur for Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.  He appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality when the Bill was under pre-legislative scrutiny.  It was on that basis, having regard to the entirety of the issues, that the age was set at 13.  We also looked at international practice.  It is noteworthy that our neighbours in the UK, Spain, Sweden, Poland and the Czech Republic all have 13.  Austria has 14.  It was on that basis, and having regard to the outcome of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Data Protection Bill, that the Government took that view.  <\/p> <p>  I refer to setting the age of consent at 13.  I believe it is important that we consider what more Government and the service providers can do to ensure there is an appropriate level of protection and that people, and parents in particular, can feel confident the State is playing its part and doing its best.  I refer to the deliberations and relationship with the service providers to ensure there are protections and safety.  That too will form part of the consultative process taking place later on in the year.  There is a lot more involved here than just setting the age.  We are also setting parameters.  It is important appropriate consideration be given, in the context of any legislative initiative, to ensure the safety and protection of children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#P00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":361,"content":"<p>Will the Minister answer my question about the onus?

It is done, as all opinions are done, in the complete interests of childhood and parental responsibility.<\/p> <p>  I want to raise the issue of gambling.  The UK has brought in legislation regarding gambling, digital games and the targeting of children.  I know psychiatry, and the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, DSM, has now introduced new terms for mental ill-health in respect of diagnosing addiction.  I refer to addiction to these games.  Certainly, child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS,  in our country has seen many more referrals where kids are completely addicted.  It is not just the addiction but also the money children of four years of age are being asked to pay for an extra life in this game.  It might be a game about bunny rabbits or something attractive to children.<\/p><p>Are there plans to tackle that, as it produces from very early on a culture of gambling and addiction to it?

Far be it for me to come here and say that I disagree with experts who have examined it.  I am very conscious of that.  We have a briefing today with Dr. Geoffrey Shannon to which I am very much looking forward to listening.  I am missing something on why the decision was made.  I am not one for going against Government policy and it would never be my intention.  Our review is ongoing and we have a place in this debate, as we are the committee dealing with children's matters.  I appreciate the logistics and the respect we must have for the justice committee.  Our discussion is relevant, however, and I note the comments of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Mitchell covered another matter, the education of parents in what can be done to assist the situation with their children etc.  I do not mean to flog the point but I mentioned Internet protocol, IP, filtering and inverting the process.  If parents wanted to get their children connected to something, they would have to educate themselves as to how to opt in.  It would create an awareness in itself.  I take Deputy Mitchell's point and perhaps both approaches would work.  However, although an expensive marketing campaign is well and good, if we essentially have a tool to empower a parent by default, it would be a sensible way forward.  I am very interested in the addiction point made by Senator Devine.  Whatever about an addiction to gambling, we are all somewhat addicted to our phones.  We cannot expect children not to be on phones when adults are on them the whole time.<\/p> <p>  There must be an attitude of growing up about this.  I do not allow myself to use my phone at times - mainly because I am being trolled all the time - and were one to look at that, one would need to be concerned about one's mental health.  I must decide not to use the phone after a certain time of the day and that is it.  It is for my own sanity.  We need to mature when it comes to our use of the Internet, and adults need to do it first and foremost.  We cannot expect children to not go on the Internet if we do not curtail our use.  Last week, Dr. Aiken stated that every moment a parent is looking at a phone is a moment when he or she is not interacting with a child.  I could speak about it all day as it is very interesting.  Do the Ministers have any comments on IP filtering in particular?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018022100002#Q00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I am not in any way an expert in this field but HEAnet provide filtering services to schools.

I see reference to this committee on the particular issue of age of consent.  There is much expert view on the matter but I would not like Senator Noone to think one body of experts is right and another is wrong.  Deciding whether to have a cut-off of 16, 15 or 14 is difficult.  We are anxious to achieve a balance.  It is not so much about having a cut-off point on somebody's birthday but of acknowledging the different levels of maturity among teenagers.  Teenagers, including those right up to the end of their teens, have different sets of attributes and levels of maturity.  One should not get completely hung up on the matter of arbitrary age.  Instead, we should look at the protection available, acknowledging of course the threats associated with cyberbullying, sexual exploitation and grooming.  We should take into account international studies and our national experience to ensure our legislative framework can have protections and safety measures.<\/p> <p>  It is something we need to do and I would, of course, be very happy to hear submissions and observations from this committee, having regard to its expertise.  Nevertheless, I would not like the debate to be that one group of experts is right and another group is wrong.

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Angela Dunne, director of midwifery, and Dr. Peter McKenna, the clinical director.<\/p> <p>  The national women and infants' health programme was established in January 2017.  The programme has responsibility for maternity services, benign gynaecology and neonatology.  The focus in 2017 was on building relationships around the 19 maternity hospitals, working with the hospital groups to establish maternity networks and developing an implementation plan for the national maternity strategy.  The implementation plan was completed in the summer of 2017 and launched by the Minister for Health in October 2017.  The plan has over 230 specific actions designed to achieve the four strategic priorities of the strategy and specifically to address the 77 recommendations in the strategy.  The programme has identified three priorities areas within the 230 actions for attention in 2018.  These are anomaly scanning, the model of care and quality and safety.  The programme was allocated &euro;4.55 million in development funding for 2018 to address the actions in the implementation plan and that funding is being targeted in the following areas.<\/p> <p>  With regard to anomaly scanning, each hospital group has been asked to identify how many additional ultra-sonographers are required to ensure that 100% of women presenting at each maternity unit can be offered an anomaly scan.  Hospital groups are being allocated funding in line with their requirements.  In addition, the programme is working with the maternity networks to ensure foetal medicine expertise is available to support ultra-sonographers when an anomaly is identified.  Given the challenges with recruitment and training, it is likely to be at least 18 months before we can achieve 100% access, but the 2018 investment will make tangible improvements.<\/p> <p>  The model of care is about providing women with informed choice regarding the care pathway they choose for their pregnancy.  The specialised and assisted models are well established, and the programme is focusing on implementing the supported care pathway.  In 2018, 52 additional midwives have been approved to support the further roll-out of the supported care pathway and to start the process of providing women with improved access to ante-natal and post-natal care closer to their homes.  The programme acknowledges that there will be challenges with recruitment, but implementing the model of care will provide midwives will greater choice about how they can best practise their profession.<\/p> <p>  The programme recognises that while we develop the model of care and increase access for women to the supported care pathway, we also must build public confidence in our maternity services.  How we deal with adverse incidents is critical to maintaining the trust and confidence of the general public and, in turn, will encourage women to access the supported care pathway.  The programme has provided each maternity network with funding to support a quality and safety manager for women and infants.  These posts will be central to the establishment within each network of a women and infants only serious incident management forum.  The forum will ensure that all incidents for all maternity hospitals within the network are reviewed by a multidisciplinary team, which includes midwives, obstetricians, neonatologists, anaesthetists and risk management.  This level of scrutiny and support will ensure units do not review incidents in isolation.  The programme has also developed a draft incident management framework for maternity services.  This process, which is aligned to the development of the serious incident management forum, will focus on a small number of very severe adverse events and seek to ensure that a similar methodology is used in investigating and reporting on these events.  By focusing on the more extreme events in a systematic manner we aim to reduce the occurrence of these events through improved quality, better reviews and sharing of learning.<\/p> <p>  I will outline how the &euro;4.55 million allocated in budget 2018 is being used.  We will fund nine additional obstetrician-gynaecologist posts.  We have engaged with the hospital groups to identify the areas of need and we hope this is the first step in adding the additional 100 posts identified by the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the HSE's clinical care programme.  We also aim to fund three perinatal pathologists as part of that process.  We have approved the appointment of an additional 28 ultra-sonographers to support access to anomaly scanning.  In addition to the 52 registered midwives for the model of care, we have approved an additional 15 clinical midwife specialists in mental health, to align with the specialist model launched in November 2017.  We have allocated 12 health and social care professionals to support the health and well-being approach to maternity services and to address identified need within the system.  We acknowledge that outside of the large centres the availability of health and social care professionals is quite limited.  We have also allocated resources to each hospital group to establish their maternity networks, and a small amount of resource to support the phase one sites that are live on the maternal newborn clinical management system.  In total, the &euro;4.55 million will support approximately 150 additional whole-time equivalents.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the programme acknowledges the importance of having a dedicated unit to focus on women and infants' issues and that we received significant development funding in 2018.  Our ambition is to ensure that the four strategic priorities of the national maternity strategy are delivered and that we continue to build trust and confidence in the general public for our maternity service.  We know that this will take investment over a number of budgets, but our goal is to ensure that every normal risk woman can access the same range of services with the same level of quality, regardless of her location.  This concludes my opening statement.  I and my colleagues will endeavour to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kilian McGrane"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":412,"content":"<p>Thank you.

The plan has 77 recommendations and 236 specific actions.  While all of the recommendations are welcome, I will concentrate on those which the institute considers the most important.<\/p> <p>  Under the health and well-being strategic priority the commitment to prioritise the recruitment of consultant perinatal psychiatrists and multi-disciplinary team members is essential.  There are currently only three perinatal psychiatrists in the country, only one of whom is full time, and all three are in the Dublin area.  Women are badly served in this respect.<\/p><p> Under the safety and quality strategic priority, the continued development of national clinical guidelines and the emphasis on audit, using the Irish maternity indicator system, IMIS, data set, should improve the standard of care to women in pregnancy.  There is a long tradition of audit in the Dublin maternity hospitals.  A lot of work has been already done in the area of guideline development under the leadership of Professor Michael Turner, clinical lead in obstetrics and gynaecology.  The involvement of the national women and infants health programme in this area is welcome.<\/p><p> There is a well-recognised deficiency at national level in access to ultrasound services.  The institute regards correcting this as a high priority.  Under the model of care strategic priority it is critical that the development of the three pathways concept and associated changes does not cause divisions between midwives and doctors.  Midwives and doctors working in the Irish health service have a long tradition of working co-operatively together.  Such is not always the case in other developed nations, sometimes with tragic results.  Teamwork and mutual respect are in the best interests of women.  Teamwork also refers to other health care professionals, such as pharmacists, etc.<\/p><p> Development of special services such as early pregnancy assessment units, neonatal screening programmes, perineal clinics and perinatal pathology services will require substantial increases in staff numbers.  Under the governance and workforce strategic priority the institute welcomes the repeated emphasis on the importance of audit in maintaining patient safety and quality.  The institute strongly supports clinical leadership in governance of the developing maternity networks within each group.  The maternity lead should be a senior clinician with both authority for implementation of the plan under discussion here today and accountability for the success, or otherwise, of implementation.  Without authority, however, the lead should not be held accountable.  The mastership model, as operated by the three Dublin hospitals, but with adaptation, could serve as a model for governance in this respect.<\/p><p> The deficiency in medical staff numbers is a cause of serious concern.  It is well known that many consultant jobs are so unattractive that no applications are received.  This is a major change from a decade ago and requires urgent and realistic action by the State.<\/p><p> Benign gynaecology gets no mention in the national maternity strategy and we regard this is a serious deficiency which needs to be addressed.  I would add that having listened to Mr. McGrane's presentation that a lot of the issues are being addressed and what he said is welcomed by the institute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Dr. Boylan.

I would like to introduce my colleagues.  I am joined by Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha, general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Association, INMO, who will give a detailed analysis, including figures, on recruitment and retention issues associated with midwifery, and Ms Mary Gorman who is a practicing midwife and member of the executive council of the INMO.  I am first vice-president and a public health nurse and midwife as well.<\/p> <p>  In January 2017 the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation appeared before this committee and welcomed the launch of the country&rsquo;s first National Maternity Strategy - Creating a Better Future Together 2016-2026.  Our midwives section has particularly welcomed the recognition, within the strategy, of the need to give pregnant women appropriate and informed choices in respect of their care during pregnancy, supported by access to the correct level of care and support for their individual needs.<\/p> <p>  One year on, the progress in implementation is very slow.  We have not developed any further midwifery-led units despite the positive feedback surrounding this model of care.  Likewise, the development of community midwifery services remains at planning stage.   Recommendation 41 of the strategy regarding hospital outreach community midwifery services was due to be fully implemented in the first quarter of 2018 but this has not occurred.<\/p> <p>  Arising from a recommendation of the report of maternity services in Portlaoise General Hospital, directors of midwifery have been appointed to all midwifery units, 19 in total.  One important thing to note about these appointments is that the post of director of midwifery has a remit which spans both the maternity hospital and the adjoining community services in the context of implementing the maternity strategy.  The INMO believes that the hospital group structure must provide for the same policy and governance at group level for midwifery services, as is the case for general services.  Therefore, the appointment of group directors of midwifery are a necessary national driver for policy and governance changes.  The implementation plan published in October 2017, which the INMO was briefed on, set out a plan for the establishment of a midwifery network within each group as a priority and stated specifically that by the second quarter of 2018 that a maternity network governance structure would be in place with a network manager, clinical lead, midwifery lead and quality and patient safety lead clearly identified.<\/p> <p>  Discussions have not taken place with the INMO yet in relation to the national governance model.  The INMO believes that midwifery services would benefit from a national governance model like the way in which general hospital governance is enhanced by the national role of group directors of nursing.  The INMO is becoming increasingly concerned at the slow pace of implementation of the strategy and with the low midwife to birth staffing ratios which continue to exist in this country.  The accepted midwife to birth ratio, which arises from evidenced based practice, is one midwife to 29.5 births.  The strategy committed to the introduction of this ratio over a number of years.<\/p> <p>  As part of the 2017 funded workforce plan the HSE committed to increasing the staff midwifery numbers from the December 2016 census figure by 96 whole-time equivalents, WTEs, at December 2017.  The most recent figures presented to the INMO by the HSE in late January 2018 show that the overall number of staff midwives have actually fallen by 16 whole-time equivalents in December 2017.  We have furnished these figures to the committee already.  The reality is that our maternity services are severely understaffed and, from the experience of the INMO, there is a funding barrier to realistic workforce and manpower planning services at undergraduate level and continuing at post-graduate level in all aspects of planning.  Midwifery is a profession which requires continuity of staffing levels and it is a concern that the highly pressurised environments in which midwives&rsquo; work do not lend themselves to retention of staff.  The pay for midwives is modestly low for the responsibilities held.  The Public Service Pay Commission is currently looking at the barriers to recruitment and retention in nursing and midwifery in Ireland and we have made a detailed submission to this body, demonstrating the fact that Ireland is currently the lowest paying country for nurses and midwives of the five main international recruiter competitors.  Ireland is currently unable to retain or recruit sufficient numbers of nurses and midwives to continue to provide safe levels of care in the current models of care delivery.  A major improvement in relation to pay and recruitment and retention planning is required to improve midwifery staffing levels and provide sufficient numbers for the expansion and development of services such as those envisaged by this strategy.<\/p> <p>  I thank members for their time today.  We will be happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms Leahy.

The national maternity strategy was launched some time ago and our role is to see how much has been implemented and whether resources have been made available to same to ensure we have safe and uniform maternity services across the country.  In that context, one of the important issues that has been consistently raised is the lack of uniformity in terms of services available to women.  One area would be the issue of scans.  For example, in Dublin, most women would be able to receive a scan, but in other parts of the country it would only be if there was a high risk, or if they were identified as having potential problems.  In that context, how much progress have we made in the area of making a scan available to every woman at 12 weeks and at around 20 weeks?  Is that something that needs an awful lot more infrastructure or is it personnel?  What are the delays in rolling out that uniform service across the country?<\/p> <p>  Another area highlighted in the report is that due to a variety of contributing factors, including demographic, lifestyle medical co-morbidities, maternity care in Ireland has become more complex but despite this, perinatal and maternal mortality rates remain low.  However, challenges remain and the proportion of complex pregnancies is increasing.  Caesarian sections are increasing, the proportion of low birth weight babies and pre-term babies are increasing and breast feeding still remains very low.  While we have, and it is acknowledged as such, a fairly safe system in terms of mortality rates, there are huge challenges in terms of outcomes.  What are the main reasons behind these issues regarding the complexities, the co-morbidities and the low birth weights?  Is there anything in the strategy to address that in terms of trying to identify early on and deal with the underlying demographics, the underlying societal problems and the underlying health problems in advance of even pregnancy - in other words, educating people well in advance of pregnancy?<\/p> <p>  There are 19 maternity centres.<\/p><p>Can they all remain as is?  Does there need to be realignment or reconfiguration or even amalgamations?  A key component of the maternity strategy is to have birth centres alongside delivery wards.  How far advanced are we in rolling out birth centres across the 19 maternity units?<\/p><p> In terms of personnel and recruitment of consultant obstetricians and midwives, the Public Service Pay Commission is looking at pay rates but are there more fundamental, underlying problems affecting recruitment such as the pressure the system is under and the potential problems for indivdiuals if things go wrong?  I refer to law suits and culpability and other such issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#D00600","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelleher.

I will not go over some of Deputy Kelleher's questions as they overlap with some of mine.  I am a big supporter of the strategy.  I have publicly stated that on numerous occasions and we have discussed it at length in the committee.<\/p> <p>  An organisational chart of the strategy showed the various directorships and positions there was a delay in filling initially.  Have all the roles been filled and down to what level?  We need an update on that.  I understand that at the highest levels, the programme director, clinical director and director of midwifery have all been appointed but have all appointments been made?<\/p> <p>  There are big concerns about perinatal services.  I keep raising the issue.  Have there been any improvements since the witnesses were last with us?  In relation to the services provided it is estimated that at least 10% of pregnant women have some form of mental health issues.  There is a lack of psychiatric services.  Are we going in the wrong direction?  Is the system stalled or are we making progress?<\/p> <p>  I would like to hear the views of witnesses on staffing numbers across the various disciplines.  I have taken on board what has been said about the mastership model.  I think that is the right model.  I would like to hear how it will be implemented across the board.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the announcement last week of the national development plan and the capital plan, we know that within the ten-year maternity strategy certain milestones have to be met.  Will we make up the time we have lost given that a couple of years have been lost?  I know the maternity facility in Limerick quite well.  I came through it myself and I have experienced the fantastic service there but the physical infrastructure is not adequate.  The sum of &euro;3 million was required in order to even carry out the assessment and planning but that was not found so we have lost a couple of years.  What are the views of witnesses in relation to that?<\/p> <p>  I am very much taken with community midwifery services.  The midwife-to-birth ratio is deeply concerning.  That is something we need to air here so that we can leverage the committee to address it.<\/p> <p>  The strategy envisages the doubling of consultant obstetricians over ten years.  We are not achieving anywhere near that so how are we going to address the issue?  Those numbers are required by the strategy.<\/p> <p>  An issue I raised previously with the witnesses is training in ultrasound.  Have we made progress in that regard?

Recruitment and retention is mentioned by both groups.  There is a deficiency in medical staff numbers.  Dr. Boylan referred to consultant jobs being so unattractive that no applications are received.  Ms Leahy referred to the recruitment and retention crisis.  Before we move on to start talking about anything else it might be possible for us to do we need to generally accept that none of that will be done unless we have the men and women who are capable, trained and willing to work in our services to deliver it.  I am interested to hear the views of witnesses on what can actually be done.  We know that pay is a major issue.  I do not think that is lost on anyone here but we also know that there are other elements and it might be possible to expand on that in terms of professional development and making the health service a more attractive place to work.<\/p> <p>  I direct my question about the 20-week anomaly scan to Mr. McGrane.  I am genuinely sick of the sound of my own voice talking about the issue at this stage as I have raised it so many times.  Whatever way one wants to dress it up, there is a postcode lottery in place at the moment.  If one happens to be pregnant in certain parts of the country one gets a hugely different service.  That is not about the quality of care, because the people who deliver the service are working extremely hard, but the system is working against those people and it is working against pregnant women.  I have asked the Taoiseach about it and the Minister for Health and with respect, they occasionally defer to Mr. McGrane although he is not there when they do it and I have an opportunity now to ask him.  Could he give us an idea when pregnant women in this State can expect as a matter of course &ndash; in the way they do in other countries &ndash; to have access to a 20-week scan?<\/p> <p>  Could Dr. Boylan and perhaps Ms Leahy explain something to us?  It has been said to me a number of times when I have asked the question that the scans are provided where they are clinically indicated but the professionals tell me that it is a screening scan so therefore it cannot be clinically indicated without a scan.  To me, that seems like a bit of a merry-go-round.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Boylan referred to benign gynaecology not being mentioned in the maternity strategy.  Could he elaborate on that for us because we have heard evidence about the waiting lists for gynaecological procedures and how they operate and the pain and distress women are in while they are waiting?  Could he elaborate on why he thinks it is not there and perhaps Mr. McGrane could advise us why it is not in the strategy?<\/p> <p>  I echo the point previously made that the strategy is now two years old.  I know that some of the implementation plan was not launched at the same time as the strategy but there you go.  We have lost time on it and, again, it is not about having a wonderful document because clearly we have a wonderful document but it is about knowing when we are going to hit those milestones and if we can, if possible, make up the time lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#E00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I will concentrate on the issues generally that have been asked about staffing.  It is very important to give some raw data in respect of the numbers.  For example, there were 1,445 staff midwives employed in the public health service in Ireland at the end of December 2017.  That was a reduction of 16 on the number employed in December 2016.  That tells us two things.  First, it tells us we are not training enough midwives and, second, we have an inability to retain them.<\/p> <p>  We train midwives in this country in two different ways.  We have a direct entry midwifery programme and we have a postgraduate higher diploma in midwifery for general nurses who want to change career and become midwives.  That programme has not met the target numbers for the past two years.  In other words, the applications are down.  It is a very good programme and it allows nurses who wish to train and work as midwives while training to qualify and thereafter register as midwives.  Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly asked what we can do in the short term.<\/p><p>We know the problem is that the pay rates are too low for nurses in general and for midwives particularly.  Deputy Kelleher asked if it was the litigious nature of the job.  There is no doubt that the pressure on midwives and the public appetite to get somebody to blame have most certainly not helped retention.<\/p><p> Dr Boylan made a very important comment.  Nurses and midwives work very well with their colleagues, obstetricians, gynaecologists, etc.  There is a lot of co-operation in the area of midwifery particularly.  As a profession, it is very independent in its practice.  That is why we welcomed the strategy so much, particularly in respect of developing services in the community.  In many jurisdictions, these services are delivered by midwives.  Our disappointment centres around the midwifery-led units.  We still have two; one in Our Lady of Lourdes and one in Cavan.  The feedback from the women who attend is very positive yet the development has not progressed beyond what was there when we last met the committee.<\/p><p> As to where we get midwives from when we cannot recruit and retain our own, the most recent figures from the nursing and midwifery board, An Bord Altranais, show us that the general service relies on recruitment from non-EU countries, particularly India and the Philippines, to make up its numbers.  That is not the case for midwifery as the qualifications do not transfer.  We have to concentrate on what we are doing at home to a greater extent, as we cannot rely on non-EU recruitment.  We have some EU recruitment, particularly from Portugal and Italy.  We recruited and registered 19 in 2015, according to the last statistics.  That has gone up slightly but, of course, there is an issue with language.  That has to be taken into account.<\/p><p> We have two possible remedies.  If for example, I want to do the postgraduate diploma in midwifery in Limerick but there is not a place there, I will go to the Coombe or the Rotunda.  However, I will not then be offered employment in Limerick.  It is bureaucracy.  There is a very simple remedy.  The circular needs to be amended to ensure that whoever sponsors me employs me once I qualify as a midwife.  That requires me to relocate.  The good thing about the postgraduate programme is that the students are usually more mature people.  They have done their initial qualification as a registered general nurse and are therefore more likely to stay.  They are obviously very interested in changing career and becoming midwives.  We have to work harder at making it attractive, to ensure that people do train as midwives after qualifying as general nurses and that it is not an expense on them.  They should not have to maintain two locations from a living perspective and should not have to do their second qualification away from their base.  Many of the postgraduates are currently dropping out and the numbers are not being met this year.  Very disappointingly, we have not even filled half the places that are available.  The remedies are there; we just need to focus on them.  The strategy will not be implemented unless we get enough of our own training as midwives.<\/p><p> Likewise, on the undergraduate programme for direct entry midwives not all the places are being filled.  Again, we have to ask why and we have to make sure that students are supported in clinical practice.  It is very intimidating, particularly in hospitals that are not maternity only, for student midwives who are training and are being rotated into a general site.  They need clinical facilitators and clinical practice co-ordinators to make sure they are confident while learning.  Unfortunately, the numbers are very low.  The general population of midwives is very low.<\/p><p> Midwives also avail of maternity leave themselves and we know replacement posts for maternity leave are just not happening across the service.  There is a deficit of about 3% in the workforce as a result.  Those on maternity leave are counted as part of the numbers as if they were at work even though they are not.  Those are some of the issues that were raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I feel strange calling Phil Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha.

With regard to the recruitment of midwives, the committee members will be very aware that public confidence in the maternity services is poor.  That is something we have to work on.  If we do not start regaining that confidence, we are not going to retain our midwives.  It is a huge part of our role.<\/p> <p>  We have had our midwives leaving the country because they want to practice normal midwifery.  They want to get experience in supportive pathways of care.  We need to start implementing our supportive pathways of care.  One of our actions for 2018 is that 20% of women in all maternity units will be offered a supportive care pathway.  That is the first step.<\/p> <p>  We also need to look at the career pathways of our midwives.  We have in place a number of clinical midwifery specialist posts in bereavement, sonography and perinatal mental health.  We are also putting in place the advanced midwifery practitioners posts, which will be another career pathway for our midwives.  There are also the managerial roles such as shift leaders and clinical nurse manager 3, CNM 3, posts.<\/p> <p>  The directors of midwifery have really made a huge change on the ground in the 19 maternity units.  The tertiary hospitals did have directors of midwifery.  I have seen a huge change in the last year in this regard.  They are the catalysts for change on the ground.  They are addressing the issues.  They are the advocates for resources, staff and the implementation of the maternity strategy.  There is a hunger for this model of care.  I am not just referring to the supportive model.  As Dr Boylan said, we work very well as teams on the ground and do not want to break that.  The strategy is about the three models of care.  It is about continuity of midwifery care through the three pathways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Other members referred to the availability of anomaly scanning.

It is a matter of both personnel and infrastructure but is predominantly a personnel issue.  Through the maternity networks, we have identified that an additional 28 ultrasonographers are required to deliver anomaly scanning to 100% of women.  More sonographers are required to ensure that dating and anomaly scans are provided for all women.  We have put the investment in this year.  There was ring-fenced money for anomaly scanning in the budget and that investment is going out this week into the system.  We know there will be a challenge in getting the number of people needed.  Over the course of the last year, in a number of locations, they have already started to upskill midwives if there is a difficulty recruiting sonographers.  That is specialised training.  The issue is almost exclusively personnel and it is twofold.<\/p><p>The stenographer carries out the ultrasound and does the counselling with the woman in the clinic, while foetal medicine expertise is required if an anomaly is identified.<\/p><p> My colleagues will comment on safe systems.  I was asked about the 19 units.  To date we have had no safety concerns with any of the 19 units but my colleagues will talk about them from a clinical perspective.  Deputy Kelly asked about populating the women and infants team.  It is a seven-person team, made up of the three of us sitting here and another four sitting in the Gallery.  We have a person to deal with quality and safety, another who has a business intelligence background and two who do general project management support.  We will hopefully have two or three more and a recruitment process is under way, although this is not slowing us down.<\/p><p> I was asked for an update on perinatal mental health.  A programme was launched in November last year by the HSE mental health directorate under Dr. Margot Wrigley, which is a specialised programme for perinatal mental health.  It had &euro;1 million in funding in 2017 to address issues such as psychiatry, and it has &euro;2 million for 2018.  The team will put in the specialist posts in perinatal psychiatry, psychology, specialist nurses and social work, and the programme will then move onto clinical midwife specialists in mental health, who will support midwives on the ground to ensure the care pathways are in place.  The launch and the ring-fenced funding announcement were very welcome.<\/p><p> Two former masters are sitting here so I will be careful about what I have to say about the mastership.  The mastership model works very well in the Dublin voluntaries and they have boards.  There will be challenges for us in moving the model into a HSE-run environment.  The best example is in the south-south west group, where Professor John Higgins has been appointed as the executive clinical director for the maternity network.  It is a work in progress and we can learn a lot from the Dublin maternity hospitals but we need that level of clinical leadership.  The model in the Dublin maternities is unique to Ireland, has worked very well and has served the system extremely well so we need to find out how to adapt it in other areas.<\/p><p> I was also asked about capital and making up for lost time.  The national maternity hospital is moving ahead as planned.  We identified Limerick as the next highest priority behind the national maternity hospital, because of risk factors with the blood bank.  The other two Dublin maternities are also on the list and we hope the announcement will mean an acceleration in the ability to draw down funding.  Ms Dunne will talk about community midwifery.  The Birthrate Plus report was launched in 2016, which was an analysis of what the appropriate midwife to births staffing ratio was at the time, based on a 2014 audit.  It recommended a 35:1 ratio but said we need to get to 29:1 when we implement the model of care.  We agree fully with the INMO in this respect so there is a significant journey to travel.  We will support 75 additional midwives with investment this year, which is a positive first step though there is a considerable distance to travel beyond that.<\/p><p> Deputy Kelly also asked about the doubling of consultants.  The nine we will get this year is a good start though we would have liked more.  I am not sure if Dr. Boylan thinks we could have got more.  We hope that the 100 that were identified will be recruited over the course of the next ten years.  Deputy O'Reilly asked about recruitment and retention and my colleagues will respond to that.  We have the same challenges as Deputy O'Reilly in that the issue of anomalies in scanning comes up repeatedly.  There are seven units which provide 100% access, seven units which provide partial access, usually where clinically indicated, and five where there is no access.  The clinical indication does not always come from a scan and it could, for example, be age-related because in some locations this will apply to women who are older than 36 or 38.  We have worked with all of these and some have made progress already, to move beyond where they were this time last year.  The south-south west area has a very good plan which it hopes to implement whereby all its sites would be able to provide 100% access this year.  I will not commit the area to a timeframe because recruitment will be a rate-limiting factor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kilian McGrane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Is it not part of the problem that you are not committing to a timeframe?

I would love to be able to say definitively but, as our opening statement said, we do expect most of this to be addressed in the next 18 months.  We will keep a very close eye on it and try to ensure the pathway for women improves even where we have not got 100% access in place.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly also raised the topic of benign gynaecology, which Deputy Kelly asked about last year and which Dr. McKenna will address shortly.  It was never envisaged that benign gynaecology would form part of the maternity strategy.  It was acknowledged that it needed to be managed within the women and infants programme and my colleague has started a process to develop a strategic plan for it.  The only way we can approach it is to adopt a similar methodology to the national cancer control programme, where there are specific timeframes whether a case is urgent or less urgent and we are resourced to meet those timeframes.  It is very damaging to women who have a condition with which they have to live for prolonged periods.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kilian McGrane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Benign gynaecology is not prioritised in many hospitals and if there are pressures on beds it will be cancelled.

There are imaginative ways in which it can be addressed but it has not had the priority within hospitals which it has needed.<\/p> <p>  The 19 centres deliver more than 1,000 babies and that is a lot by international standards.  The four big hospitals deliver between 8,000 and 9,000 and that is massive by European standards.  One cannot say any of the units is too small by international standards.  Our remit is not to close units but to comment on their safety and we have no concerns as regards the smaller units.  It may become more difficult to staff them and the posts may become less attractive but that is a separate issue from the question of closing one over safety issues.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is patient complexity.  Patients are getting older, which is happening through demographics and postponing families.  Patients are getting larger, which is happening at an alarming rate and which causes increased morbidity.  More patients benefit from assisted reproduction and an increasing proportion of women are having their first baby as families get smaller.  These factors all feed into increased complexity.  The population is becoming more complex from the point of view of maternity and Dr. Boylan will comment on this.<\/p> <p>  Money is an issue in consultant recruitment but so is workload and quite a lot of work in maternity services could be on an on-call basis.<\/p><p>If someone works in a smaller unit, they may be on a four-person team.  That is committing that person to a lifetime of on call after holidays of one in three.  The question of compensation or inducement is very clear but, similarly, there is also the issue that should anything go wrong, the individual has the regulatory authorities and the press to answer to.  It is not very attractive, as the committee can well imagine, for somebody who has set out on professional pathway to find themselves the object of adverse attention in the press.  It is measure of incentive and the fact that elements of the job may not be very attractive but I am sure Dr. Boylan will have a similar viewpoint.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter McKenna","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Dr. Boylan will address some of the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#H00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Several points have been raised, some of which are overlapping.  With regard to the complexity of pregnancies, Dr. McKenna is absolutely correct.  Women are getting older when they are having their children, particularly their first baby.  Many of the complex problems associated with assisted reproduction are the result of donor egg pregnancies.  One finds women in their late 40s and perhaps into their 50s presenting with pregnancies, sometimes with twins.  They also have hypertension or diabetes so their pregnancies are far more complex than would have been the case a decade ago.  This presents particular challenges for management.  It places extra demands on those consultants working in the system.<\/p> <p>  Women are also coming through who have survived as a consequence of excellent neonatal care.  For example, women who had surgery as newborn children for complex cardiac conditions are now coming through and reaching the time when they are having children.  This is obviously another area, so there are a lot of complex medical problems among women at the moment and things are becoming more complex.  Of course, obesity is a major issue in Irish society.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the litigious nature of the job, pregnancy is generally expected to be a happy event where everything goes very well normally and one gets a healthy baby at the end of it.  Consequently, when things do not work out, the consequences - the disappointment, anxiety and grief - are much more accentuated than if somebody goes into hospital with a long-term illness and maybe dies after surgery or after being in hospital for a prolonged period.  The expectations are different from the rest of medical practice.  When things do not work out as expected, the natural inclination of people is to wonder what went wrong, why it went wrong, whether anyone is to blame for this or whether it was a mistake or a negligent mistake where people did not take due care.  That places an extra strain on people working in the system.  When something goes wrong, such as when a baby dies or is damaged as a consequence of a human error, the people working on the ground need to be regarded as the second victims in this scenario.  They feel it deeply, particularly the midwives, because in crises they are of tremendous assistance but they are not the ones making the decisions.  They may sometimes see things happening with which they disagree and they are right, so for them to see something go wrong and to know that the doctor has done something wrong but has ignored their advice is particularly hard on them.  Young trainee midwives go into it and see many happy births - it is a tremendously rewarding profession - then something goes wrong and they are in the midst of this maelstrom of grief, anger and blame.  <\/p> <p>  One of the problems we have, which relates to the retention of staff, is the fact, as mentioned by Dr. McKenna, that sometimes there may be three or four consultants staffing a smaller unit.  With holidays, study leave and so on, that works out at each consultant being on call every third 24-hour period and every third weekend from Friday morning until Monday morning when they carry the entire responsibility for what is going on.  What frequently happens is that a locum or an agency doctor consultant will be brought into a smaller unit over the weekend.  In a bank holiday scenario, the agency consultant will have come on duty on the Friday.  In the event of a catastrophe at 9 p.m on that Friday, the consultant who had been attending to the patient will have been away and will come back on the Tuesday morning after the bank holiday.  There may well have been agency midwives as well.  The woman will have gone home but nobody will have informed the consultant or the midwives working on the ward and they are all very busy running around.  The woman will go home and effectively is almost abandoned.  When the consultant meets her - possibly because the general practitioner will have contacted the consultant - he or she does not really know an awful lot about the case and is taken unawares.  That is one area where the network development is very important.  It is in its infancy and it will take time.  If one has a network, one will have audit of all of the outcomes - all of the births, caesarean sections, adverse outcomes and so on - as is the model in the larger units, particularly in the Dublin hospitals on a weekly, monthly and annual basis.  It is like running any good business.  People running a hotel need to know how many guests they have, how many were happy, how many were disappointed, bed occupancy and revenue per room etc.  In the same way, from a clinical perspective one needs to know what is happening to the women coming through the door with regard to their outcomes, how many of them got infected, how many had blood transfusions, how many had caesarean sections, how many babies went to the neonatal unit etc.  All of that needs to be done continuously.  This is where the network audit system that is being instituted by the office is extremely valuable and will make a huge contribution to improving safety and quality in the future.  <\/p> <p>  The other thing about working in a smaller unit is that by virtue of the on-call commitment these consultants have, they will run out of their pay for being on call to such an extent about halfway through the year or maybe earlier.  After that, they are working for the State on call for free.  That is a problem.  I do not think any other person working in the health service would work for free.  We would not find the porters, laboratory people or anybody else saying it was fine and that they had earned their cache of overtime for this year and would work for free overtime for the rest of the year.  I do not think that would happen but consultants have been doing that for years.  That is a problem that needs to be addressed.  <\/p> <p>  I have spoken about the recruitment and retention of consultants.  It may well be that if a new contract is negotiated with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and all the consultant groups, it may evolve into something along the lines of the Australian model where doctors get paid for their public commitment and have a choice as to how much public commitment they give.  They have a choice as to how much public commitment they give but they must give a minimum.  So one may find a doctor who says they want to give four sessions a week to the public service and spend the rest of their time in the private sector.  They only get paid for their four sessions in the public service with a relevant contribution to a pension fund which they can manage themselves.  That is a huge advantage to the State.  It works for the doctors because they can do what they want in terms of commitment to public or private practice and it works for the hospital because it knows exactly what the doctor is due to be doing.  It is a system that works very well in Australia so it is something that might be worth looking at.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Is there as much continuity in that type of casualised-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#H00400","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":441,"content":"<p>One does get continuity because a lot of doctors just want to stay in the public system because it is more comfortable and less challenging in terms of generating one's own income and so on.

One would not allow a consultant to have one session a week in the public service.<\/p><p>One would have to have a minimum amount to make it realistic. <\/p><p> Linked in with that, reference was made to the master shift system, which works extremely well in the single stand-alone maternity hospitals.  The model of the south-south-west system that was mentioned, of which Professor John Higgins is the executive clinical director, is one that needs to be developed for all the networks, but it is really important that maternity services, including gynaecology, have separate governance and separate budgets, just like the cancer strategy.  A separate budget is critical.  What happened in Cork is a classic example of where that can go wrong; the budget for maternity services was eaten into by the general hospital.  As Dr. McKenna said, the first thing to get sacrificed is gynaecology; women's health care gets sacrificed first when there is a push.  A separate budget and co-location of the maternity hospitals with the general hospitals is critical, as opposed to integration because then they get sucked into all of the problems one gets in the general hospitals.  When a crisis arises in the emergency department and patients are on trolleys, where do they go? They go to a gynaecology ward.  What gets cancelled?  Gynaecology.  Obviously, one cannot cancel obstetrics.  <\/p><p> Benign gynaecology has been dealt with.  Regarding perinatal mental health services, we have heard that those are being improved and that is critical.  With respect to the capital plan, the development of the new hospitals is welcomed but co-location rather than integration is a critical factor as well as having separate governance and separate budgets.  <\/p><p> I mentioned in my opening statement the importance of midwives and doctors working together as teams.  It is critical we do not lose the tremendous co-operation and teamwork we have had between midwives and doctors in the Irish health service down the years.  There is a terrible tendency to look to the UK and say what they are doing is good and, therefore, we will do it.  It is not always good.  It has had very serious problems in its maternity services.  We do not want to repeat the mistakes of separating out midwifery and obstetric care.  There are both the same.  All obstetricians are midwives and are proud to be midwives but they are also looking after more complicated cases.  It is essential they work together and that we do not lose sight of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Boylan.

I have even come across cases where an adverse event occurred which subsequently involved an inquest and the staff prepared statements without being given any support in their preparation and were facing into an inquest without have been given any support prior to it.

The witnesses might comment on that issue.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of staff leaving the services, there are 19 units around the country, is there any evidence that a higher number of staff are leaving a particular unit or is the number leaving the units similar across the board?  Has any analysis been done on that?  Is there an interview process in place prior to staff leaving the services to establish the issues they have had to deal with, the reasons they are leaving and whether it is due  to a family commitment, because they are leaving the country, the salaries or the stress levels?  This also applies to trainee doctors.  I recently came across two trainee doctors who had been in the obstetrics and gynaecological area for six years who decided they could not deal with the stress levels and have now decided to go into GP training.  Has that issue been examined?<\/p> <p>  We talked about the 2003 report that was published that dealt with the need for consultants.  It identified that there should be 180 consultants by 2012.  The number we currently have is 130 to 135.  People will be retiring.  Have we forecast the number who will be retiring?  If we are talking about replacing nine additional posts this year, what number will be retiring?  That issue must also be dealt with.  That ties in with the number of people training in obstetrics and gynaecology who are on the specialist register or who want to get on to it.  Are sufficient numbers coming through the system or will we be seeking to recruit from outside the State to fill any targets we set?  Have figures being prepared on the number who are retiring, the number of new jobs we need to create, and the number who are in training?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of nursing staff, figures were given for the number of staff nurses and we heard that the number had decreased compared to 2016.  Are there actual figures for the number of people who are in training and do we know what their intentions are once they complete their training?  Has a survey been carried out on that?  Is it the case that they intend to leave the country?  Do we have any idea what their intentions are, especially the people who will complete their training over the course of the next 12 months?  That would give us an idea of nursing staff numbers.  I thank the witnesses for dealing with the issues they covered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#J00400","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I remind the witnesses to ensure their mobile phones are switched off, as a phone rang there.

Regarding the deficiencies in the postgraduate and undergraduate courses and the location of adequate encouragements, for want of a better description, to ensure the people who embark on those courses have a place to go and are sure of where they want to go at the end of them, to what extent do the witnesses bring that to the attention of the authorities?<\/p><p>I am a great believer in the chain of command, and I am sorry about the director who, unfortunately, must take responsibility for all of these things as it is a difficult position, presuming the director has a full and total free hand in delivering the services we are speaking about.  It is a two-way process.  How does it work?  What happens when the director responds to the queries coming from the ground?  Does anything happen?  Is it slow?  Is there a possible resolution?  If not, why not?<\/p><p> With regard to the risk factors, and looking at a number of cases that have come up in recent times, I feel very sorry for the professional people involved.  I have to say I am equally sorry for the unfortunate victims in those circumstances.  No matter how sorry one is for the victims, it does not replace the person who has gone, whether it is the mother or the child.  Something has to be done about bank holiday weekend cover.  We need to do something about it as a matter of some urgency.  There are no circumstances in my opinion where a woman going in for a crisis pregnancy or a normal pregnancy should be in a situation where her consultant is missing and cannot be there.  In the event of an emergency arising it is a very daunting and lonely place for her to be.  I note what Dr. Boylan said on overtime and the on-call system, but some means has to be found to protect the lives of those who may be at risk in those circumstances.  Quite frankly I do not care what has to be done but it is time to do it.  There is no time for discussion afterwards.  There is no sense going into court afterwards and stating something went wrong and people are sorry it happened.  Of course we are all sorry it happened, but it is a sad thing that it goes to court.<\/p><p> I am only a simple member of the male population but problems with the provision of oxygen during birth seems to occur more than occasionally.  I do not know why this is.  There must be somebody who knows and who is familiar with the procedures who should be asking questions as to why it happens.  We are told all of the time that we have one of the safest systems in the world.  If that is so, why should this occur?  Should a different procedure be followed at an earlier stage to prevent it happening?  Who makes the decisions?  Who is the decision maker?  Is advice available to the person on the ground on his or her own who may be making a very serious decision in a very short space of time?  Can that person refer to anybody further up the line?  With modern technology, or whatever the case may be, is it possible to do so?  If not, why not?  It is totally unfair to have a situation whereby the person in the ward at the time of the emerging crisis is left alone to make a decision or has insufficient authority to make a decision.  I know about the clash between doctors and midwives and I am not referring to this.  There needs to be more than one person involved in making that crucial decision.  It is crucial from the point of view of the professionals and, more especially, crucial for the woman and the baby.<\/p><p> Does the director have adequate resources in respect of maternity services?  I know what the answer to that is.  Does the director have adequate authority to make the decisions that are required to be made in a short space of time to ensure the best possible quality and standard of service is made available to those directly involved, by which I mean the mother, the baby and the staff on the spot in the maternity hospital?  They are the people in the eye of the storm.  They are the people who will be in the eye of the storm afterwards in the event of litigation.<\/p><p> It is much better to put in place corrective measures than to spend time defending in court what appears to be the indefensible.  It may not be the indefensible, and there will always be accidents and we accept this.  We cannot prevent accidents happening.  However, a certain amount of accidents can be prevented and it is these we need to zoom in on and try to come to a decision on them and provide knowledge back up.<\/p><p> The retention of staff at all levels comes up again and again.  It will become more difficult.  Way back some years ago benchmarking was introduced.  Nobody ever admitted this, but while the cost of living was given as the reason this was not the case.  It was the cost of housing that drove it mad.  The cost of renting a house and the cost of taking out of mortgage has nearly doubled.  Rent has definitely doubled and more than doubled over the past five or six years.  This obviously will be a disincentive for anybody, particularly a young person going to work in the health services, or in any service for that matter.  I make this as a passing point because we may have to find a way or means to do something about it.  I am not saying we should go back to benchmarking, because we paid the price for that previously.  It was the identification of the problem that was wrong and not the benchmarking.  It was identification of the underlying problem, which was the inability of professionals to take out a mortgage or rent a house at any particular time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#J00600","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for all they do every day and I thank them for coming before the committee this morning.  How we read this document depends on through what lens we look at it.  Through the lens I am looking at it now I see the use of the word \"women\" and \"mother\" throughout the strategy.  In acknowledgement of equality in Ireland, and out of respect, perhaps we could change that to \"person\" or \"pregnant person\", in light of members of the trans community feeling the strategy does not refer to them in any sense.  I take slight issue with the term \"mother\" being used because sometimes one does not ever get to become a mother.  One may get half-way there or three quarters way there.  I would like the language to be tidied up a bit, in light of all I have learned in recent years.<\/p> <p>  I had a quick search of the document for the words \"termination\", \"abortion\", \"crisis pregnancy\" and \"the eighth amendment\" and I can only find one reference at the bottom of page 36.  Whatever one's views are, it seems very unusual or strange that the document could be written without any nod to the impact of Article 40.3.3&deg; on maternity services in Ireland and the impact it has had on professionals working in the area.  There is also the fact the HSE provides HSE-branded information for women seeking terminations in the UK, so it is not like taxpayers' money is not being spent.  I find it very strange this is not even referred to in the strategy.  Post repeal of the eighth amendment, I hope, at the end of May, are the witnesses ready to edit the document in light of the potential change that will happen?<\/p> <p>  Feedback from the midwife-led services in Cavan and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is good.  Do we have any data on actual outcomes?  What is meant by feedback?  Is it just a chat or is it women reporting it was better than the last time?  What is that tangible data?  The Domino scheme is very successful in Holles Street hospital and I hear very good reports on it.  There are geographical issues with rolling out a similar programme outside Dublin.  Do we have any plans for rolling it out?<\/p> <p>   I understand that public health nurses do not require a midwifery qualification.  Has an audit or assessment been done on that change in qualification, with regard to the outcomes for mothers, newborn babies and any children already at home?<\/p> <p>  With regard to folic acid and our alarming rate of neural tube defects in this country, how are we on this now?<\/p><p>I know that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has conducted a study of the safe upper limit for water soluble folic acid.  Will we bite the bullet and start to fortify something that people could eat or drink to address the high incidence of neural tube defects?  There is no need for me to explain the defects to the medical personnel present, but for the information of anyone listening to this broadcast, it means spina bifida and other health issues.  Fortifying products would prevent some of the serious and challenging outcomes from occurring for parents and children as a result of poor pre-natal nutrition. <\/p><p> When he was here last year Did Mr. McGrane say the health service was down 100 consultants?  If so, we needed to recruit those consultants.  Nine have been appointed.  Did we lose any?  What has been the net gain?  What is the current position?  Mr. McGrane said we would address the recruitment problem in the next ten years.  The problem is that the health service is short 100 consultants.  Also, it was projected last week that the population would grow by 1 million.  I am sure some of them will be women who will look to have children.  Obviously, demands are placed on health services owing to multiple births, the incidence of obesity, age, IVF treatment and other factors.  To my mind, it is not good enough that in the health service there a deficit in the number of consultants, unless Mr. McGrane spoke in error.  If not, it is wrong for him to think it acceptable for women and their families - men, husbands and fathers - that it will take ten years to address a deficiency that was identified a couple of years ago.  As my colleague said, women's health has been neglected for many decades and, possibly, a century.  It is just not good enough to have corrective measures spanning ten years.  Women are suffering and it is imperative that we deal with the deficiencies in the service as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p> The on-call issue must be addressed.  I am fully aware that many doctors are not paid for being on-call and there is only so much time that their goodwill will last.  Such work is unattractive.  Someone would not be a consultant at 26 years of age but in his or her early 30s.  It is grand being on-call and working every third night.  However, we all know that as one gets on in age such work gets harder.  It is no way to have a career, a family life or a personal life.  It is just not an attractive career and we are shedding personnel.  I refer to what Dr. Boylan said about the Australian model.  We must do something about how we attract people into the system and keep them.<\/p><p> Ms Dunne said the level of public confidence in maternity care was poor.  I disagree with her.  I am not sure if her statement is based on research or what she is feeling, but I would say the level of public confidence in maternity care is quite high.  I do not think anybody is terrified when a woman enters a maternity unit to have a baby delivered, but perhaps I am wrong.  I had very good experiences when I used the public system and think the outcomes are very good, despite the deficits.<\/p><p> We have spoken at length about Sl&aacute;intecare and anomaly scans.  I am not sure whether it was here or elsewhere, but that does not matter.  It is welcome that money has been released this week.  We have also heard about the upskilling of personnel to perform anomaly scans.  We have also heard about the difficulties owing to the job being repetitive and quite difficult and that if one has a bad day when there are a lot of anomalies, it generates stress.  A year and a half has elapsed.  Where are we now in dealing with the issue?  It seems that there have been no tangible results.  I fully acknowledge that it could not be an infrastructural or machine issue where one just buys the machines, that rather it is a people issue.  <\/p><p> On the omission of gynaecology from the strategy, I do not want to criticise my own but the Taoiseach who is a doctor has signed off on the first page.  It seems unusual that two aspects have been decoupled.  I do not know how one can separate obstetrics from benign gynaecology when the same people do the same job and the two aspects are interconnected.  Perhaps someone might make a suggestion in that regard.  Do we slot an additional segment into the strategy? <\/p><p> On the mastership model, I fail to see how there is an issue with implementing it outside Dublin and ask the delegates to elaborate on the matter.  I have heard that the model has worked quite well.  <\/p><p> On triage policy and the prioritisation of scans for women based on data, a mother's age and the number of babies a woman is carrying, Professor Louise Kenny appeared before the committee some time ago.  On that occasion we drilled down into the numbers and I extrapolated from what she had said there was one case a week.  That means that each week there is one child born somewhere in Ireland, perhaps in a regional hospital, with a condition that was not diagnosed prenatally.  Whether it is 52 or 2 babies who are affected, that is just not good enough.  In other countries it is standard procedure to scan.  A scan brings peace of mind, but it also allows for preventive actions to be taken and measures to be put in place to be followed at the time of birth.  The current measure addresses as a priority something that has been deficient for years; it is not a ten-year plan.  From a director's point of view - I do not mean to be critical - I do not see this as being good enough.<\/p><p> Dr. Peter McKenna said there were imaginative ways by which the benign gynaecology issue could be addressed.  I ask him to elaborate on the matter. <\/p><p> I am very supportive of having separate governance arrangements and budgets where there is co-location.  It is co-location, not integration.  There are historical reasons for the abandoning of women with gynaecological problems.  Women seem to have accepted the fact that incontinence or having a prolapsed uterus are side effects of having babies, that they are things one gets over and walks around with.  I challenge any man to walk around for a couple of years with a prolapsed anything and not to stand outside the gates of Leinster House holding a placard referring to his bits and bobs.<\/p><p> I wish to refer to what Deputy Bernard J. Durkan said about benchmarking.  Recently in respect of the Civil Service it was mentioned that there should be a Dublin weighting or that an extra allowance should be paid to those who worked in the city.  It is normal for staff who work in the National Health Service or the private sector to receive extra money to meet the higher rents and greater expenses associated with living in the city of London or urban centres in the United Kingdom.  It is no good wringing one's hands and saying a weighting system could not be introduced for a midwife, a nurse or even a person who is training to be a doctor.  It is not possible to commute from Tyrrellspass to St. James's Hospital.  That is no way to start one's day or live one's life.  We must adopt a multifaceted approach to make working in maternity services attractive.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and delegates for their patience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#K00200","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Members have asked a number of questions.

Ms Leahy works in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and will give an overview of its nurse-led unit and audit mechanism.<\/p> <p>  On recruitment and retention in general, Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony asked what would fix the problems.  The measurement we have used in our submission to the Public Service Pay Commission is purchasing power parity, in respect of which we took into account the cost of living and earning potential.  For example, the average staff nurse earns between &euro;28,900 and &euro;42,000 over a timespan of nearly 20 years, which is very modest pay.  Student nurses do not earn an income; they only receive the minimum wage of just over &euro;9 an hour during their 36 weeks of training.  In some cases, they must pay for two units of accommodation because their clinical placement is completed in two separate locations.  These aspects must be corrected to make nursing an attractive proposition and counteract the reduction in the number of applicants.  Of course, the cost of living has got a lot to do with the reduction in the number of applicants.<\/p> <p>  On purchasing power parity, we know that health services in the United Kingdom have always been a huge fan of the Irish trained midwife and nurse.<\/p><p>That is going to become increasingly attractive.  Our market is going to become increasingly attractive.  Weighting in London adds about 21%.  That is not confined to London, however.  It applies in any major city, including Manchester and Bristol.  Great Ormond Street Hospital comes to recruit our paediatric nurses immediately on qualification, and it succeeds.  <br\/><br\/>We know all of this, as do the Government and the party of Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Durkan.  We have made numerous submissions to them.  I would argue that it is now within those Deputies' gift to correct it, and I urge them to do so.  Paying people &euro;28,900 and expecting them to be exposed to what Dr. Boylan described cannot continue.  There will never be a developed maternity strategy unless the Government bites the bullet and corrects the salary of low-paid women.  I emphasise that they are predominantly women.  There are four male midwives in the country according to the last count.  Nursing is not very different.  We can talk around it, but the simple fact of the matter is that we have overcrowding to such an extent that there were 640 patients on trolleys on Monday of this week, for whom there are no beds.  Absolutely every non-urgent elective case must then be cancelled.  We are not dealing with the reasons the beds are closed.  <br\/><br\/>Yesterday I spoke to somebody in the HSE who says that the Minister has announced 540 new acute beds.  We welcome that.  Several of them will be opened based on the beds that have been closed.  Where will the health service get the staff to open them?  It cannot open beds and not recruit staff.  It all goes back to the same central point.  People must be paid properly for what they are expected to do and what they are exposed to.  The levels of burnout and the levels of assault in midwifery have increased.  These issues are all related and come back to the same circle of recruitment and retention.  We have provided the figures.  They are the HSE's figures.  There are 16 fewer midwives working in the front line today than there were on 16 December.  That is despite recruitment measures, including recruitment from Portugal and Italy.  We are battling in recruitment, entry and retention.  Somebody has to do something about it, and we urge the Government parties to do something about it.  It is within their gift. <br\/><br\/>In respect of the inquiries, it is important to emphasise what happens when an adverse incident happens, particularly in the HSE.  The first thing that happens is an oversight investigative process is put in place by the employer.  The practitioner is called to that as a witness.  Senator Burke asked what supports are available.  More often than not, the practitioner is then subjected to a Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, investigation.  The oversight investigative process which the HSE conducts usually looks at the learning outcomes.  It is not supposed to apportion blame, but we know that there have been incidents where blame has been apportioned.  The practitioner is then subjected to a HIQA inquiry.  In the case of nurses, midwives and medical staff, a statutory body becomes involved.  This is a separate process.  In many instances, a disciplinary procedure is instigated by the employer in addition.  For instance, there may be a coroner's inquiry, which involves An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na<br\/><br\/>A speaker was absolutely right to note that the employer does not support any staff member going through that.  In the main, it is their trade union that supports them.  We have specific insurance policies for our members who go through this.  We pay their legal fees and the cost of their counselling services, and we are constantly saying to the employer that this situation is not good enough.  We are happy to do it and happy that our membership covers that cost.  However, without their trade union they would have absolutely no support in many instances.<br\/><br\/>I am glad to have been asked the question as it gives me the opportunity to set the record straight.  It is one of the respects in which our midwives in particular, who have been through a number of inquiries in this country of late, are very critical of their employer.  Some of them have been followed to their homes by journalists.  This should be anticipated.  When a practitioner is undergoing an inquiry, there should be a separate room for them, with a separate exit by which they can leave, so that they are not identified.  We should not have to go before the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland to argue for an <i>in camera <\/i>hearing.  The employer should be quite willing to agree that this takes place.  Ultimately the staff member will be found not to have been professionally questionable, but it will not matter, because the media has destroyed their name in the process.  It is a very serious issue, and one that is readily rectifiable. <br\/><br\/>Dr. Boylan referenced the Australian system.  We have had years of Ministers talking about other services.  When he was the Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly said that we need the system of health care that they have in the Netherlands.  We have had years of this.  We cannot transplant another system into our own when we have absolutely no primary care development and our outreach maternity services do not exist.  In particular, we cannot transplant a system into ours until we develop the community services in the first instance.  That is one of the areas where nurse advancement and midwifery advancement have particularly helped in other jurisdictions.  I refer to advanced midwifery practice in smaller units.  There is a very important place for the advanced midwife practitioner.  This practitioner would be a constant staff member in a certain location, very well-practiced and very skilled in the area of infant and mother care.  <br\/><br\/>I want to make a point in respect of the clinical nurse specialists, CNSs, referred to by Mr. Kilian McGrane.  I refer to the numbers mentioned and the funding for the posts, the sum of approximately &euro;4 million.  I have calculated that 82 posts are at issue.  Each one of those clinical specialists will come from the pool of midwives that are currently working.  They are not new posts. Most of them are uplifts from the current posts.  That means we will lose 82 current posts unless we agree to backfill each one of the clinical nurse specialist posts.<br\/><br\/>We have spent the last two weeks talking to the HSE about the funded workforce plan for 2018.  There is no mention of backfill for maternity posts in that strategy.  We urge both the HSE, which is represented here, and the representatives of the Government party to carry our message to the Department of Health and to the Minister.  There is absolutely no hope that this strategy will be implemented unless each CNS is backfilled and we have a plan for the development of advanced practice in midwifery.  We know that the latter works, because in jurisdictions where it is in place, it contributes massively to the service provided for women across gynaecology and obstetrics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>In regard to the midwifery-led unit, MLU, a committee member asked about audits and about how it was perceived.

That has been a big problem in the UK, where significant numbers of consultants are on gardening leave because of problems with their practice.  We need to be careful to do it properly.<\/p><p> As we have heard, outcomes in Irish obstetric care are very good by international standards.  That is in spite of, rather than because of, our staffing.  It is also important to replace those who retire.  This means that in addition to hiring ten new staff members, we must also replace outgoing staff members.  Many people talk about the airline industry when they are making comparisons with safety.  I do not think passengers would be happy if someone came over the intercom prior to take-off to explain that they are being flown by a trainee pilot who has been recruited because the regular pilot is unfortunately on holidays and to express the hope that as the trainee pilot has almost finished his or her training, everyone will get there safely.

It is good that they leave because we do not want people going through a training system, being unhappy at the end and then working in a system in which they are just not comfortable.<\/p><p> A question was asked about a lack of oxygen during birth.  Birth is a hazardous process.  That is why so much attention is placed on it.  Advice is always available.

In the majority of countries where this is widespread, it is done in the community at less than ten weeks, and there is also the medical termination of pregnancy and the tablets we have heard about which are currently being imported.  Obviously, that is something that would be addressed between ourselves and the community services etc.<\/p><p> It is blindingly obvious that folic acid should be in food.  We should just get on with it.  I understand there is some kind of problem with the importation of flour from England to make bread in this country.  All these problems should be overcome.<\/p><p> I believe Dr. McKenna will talk about gynaecology.  I suggest that a modification of the mastership model, along the lines of the development that is happening in the South\/South West hospital group, represents the way forward for governance.  I emphasise the real importance of having separate governance and a separate protected budget for women's health care, including maternity and gynaecology.<\/p><p> Reference has been made to the Australian system.  I acknowledge one cannot import an entire system but one can import bits of it.  Obviously, we would not do exactly the same things as Australian doctors.  I think this is something that should be looked at from a specialist point of view when we are encouraging recruitment and encouraging doctors to stay in the Irish system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Do we have an idea of the number of consultants who will be retiring over the next five years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#N00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I cannot give that number off the top of my head, but it is very well known.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":463,"content":"<p>We want to create a number of new places in addition to replacing the people who are retiring.

I thank Deputy Durkan for his question and his incisive observation about the recurrent problem of the deprivation of oxygen.  We hear that the maternity services - benign gynaecology - consume between 2% and 3% of the health care resources of this country.  On the other hand, we contribute to 60% of the payouts from the courts as regards medical negligence and compensation.  There is a huge disparity between the resources we have to work with and the justifiable expectations of patients as regards adverse outcomes.  Without commenting on the generosity of the awards, I will say that the courts will only award money in the event of what they perceive as being negligence.  These are preventable, or potentially preventable, issues.  We have set this as one of our targets for reduction in the coming years.  It is estimated that it is possible that 50% or more of the more tragic cases could have been avoided with different action.  I thank the Deputy for drawing attention to this area, which we are very conscious of trying to rectify.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell asked about benign gynaecology.  We recently visited Castlebar, which is one of the more difficult places to get to for those who are based in Dublin.  We were phenomenally impressed by the quality of the gynaecological service there.  The gynaecological clinic there has all the facilities needed for it to run on the spot.  Ultrasound is available in the clinic, which means one does not need to make an appointment to go to have an ultrasound and then come back.  Hysteroscopy is available there on the spot.  One can have a hysteroscopy and possibly have some endometrial pathology removed if one needs it.  This is possible for two reasons, the first of which is the availability of the medical champions who want to do it and the second of which is the presence of an administration that prioritises it and allows it to be done.  That is what I mean by an imaginative approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter McKenna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I will keep my comments brief and will focus on areas that have not been touched on already.

I cannot remember its exact title.  We will come back to the committee with the specifics.  Our colleagues in general midwifery and through the institute would identify if there are requirements for change.  We would have a role in that but it is not our area of responsibility.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also spoke about risk factors.  I think we are all very aware of the points raised by Dr. Boylan about on-call and weekends.  I totally agree that they need to be addressed.<\/p><p>Dr. McKenna spoke about hypoxia and the risk factors and this is our focus of attention.  We mentioned in our opening address our draft instant management framework that sets out a process by which we would hope to standardise even the reviews of these cases.  This would have a number of advantages, including the lessons that would be disseminated.  It would be the responsibility of the programme to ensure that lessons from an incident in an individual location would be disseminated nationally.  That responsibility falls with us.<\/p><p> In terms of the adequacy of the programme's resources to discharge its responsibilities, there are two separate elements.  Each individual hospital is accountable for what it delivers.  We spoke about the mastership.  The masters are responsible for the services provided in their institution.  The programme could not possibly do that remotely.  At the moment, we have the resources that we have been given.  We could probably have spent a little more but not a hell of a lot more.  We sought in the region of &euro;14 million for development funding for the programme.  That is a full-year cost.  If we got &euro;7 million, that is probably the very most we could have spent in a year.  Colleagues in both the institute and the INMO have highlighted the recruitment challenges.  Therefore, the sum of &euro;4.55 million is probably not far off the maximum we could have expended in a year in terms of staffing levels.  We are satisfied with what we have.  It will be up to us to demonstrate that it is used effectively in order to attract additional funding next year.<\/p><p> I note Deputy O'Connell's point about \"person\" rather than \"woman\".  She mentioned the issue about terminations, which was outside our control.  If there is a repeal and legislation is passed, it will be up to us to size its implications for the service, subject to there being a surgical impact.  The risk is that there would be an impact on gynaecology waiting lists if surgical procedures are required.  <\/p><p> The midwifery led unit, MLU, has been addressed, as has foetal folic acid.<\/p><p> I appreciate Deputy O'Connell's point that we should get them now if we are short 100 consultants.  The proposal of both the institute and the clinical care programme was that we would invest in ten consultants a year for ten years.  We could stretch to nine this year although we would like to have had more.  As Dr. Boylan said, whether we would have got them is not 100% certain.  It is a positive message to say that we are investing in maternity services and it is to be hoped that that will attract more people into the training programme.  <\/p><p> We have covered the on-call issue.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Connell responded to Ms Dunne's observations about the public confidence.  Our experience is that public confidence gets hit regularly.  We have regular adverse media coverage.  As recently as last Monday, it was on the foetal monitor issue.  We then get feedback from the institutions stating that women are coming in and asking whether the monitors are safe.  We know there are challenges with cardiotocography, CTG, interpretation but that is not an issue that is specific to the monitor; it is a training and development issue.  We are very concerned about that public trust and confidence.  We want women to avail of the supported care pathway.  We do not want them to feel they must have multiple scans outside of what is required and access to an obstetrician every time they come in because their confidence in the service is impacted.  That is a big concern from our perspective.<\/p><p> I fully accept what Deputy O'Connell said about anomaly scanning, both the challenge for staffing and the upskilling.  The number of 28 is what the system said we need and hopefully we will get most of them this year.  Some of them will come in on a training programme which could take up to 18 months.  That is why we are saying it is likely to be the end of next year before we have everything that is required.<\/p><p> On the mastership, and Dr. Boylan has related to this as well, as the voluntary hospitals in Dublin are individual institutions, they are not part of the HSE.  They therefore can appoint a chief executive officer, CEO, or, in their case, a master who reports to the board.  In a HSE context, it is different.  There is only one CEO or director general and currently there is not a board but a directorate.  As I said, the South\/South West group appointed an executive clinical director and that kind of model would work very well.<\/p><p> I acknowledge what Deputy O'Connell said about budgets.  We have to be careful though.  In a stand-alone unit, the budget needs to be separated but if it is part of a large general hospital such as that in Wexford, Mullingar or Kilkenny, it takes 4% or 5% of the gross budget.  If we start pulling those budgets out, the maternity directorate within it would then be responsible for portering, cleaning etc.  In a hospital of that size, it may not be feasible.  We therefore have to come up with a hybrid which does exactly the same, that is, it protects the resource, which is our key bit.  We cannot come up with something that is not workable in a unit that has maybe 1,500 births in a very busy hospital.  There is a collegiality aspect.  Radiology, pathology and all of the other facets have to work together.  We do not want to break something that works but, at the same time, we want to respect that governance and protect the resources that go in. <\/p><p> We accept the point Deputy O'Connell made about co-location.  I will not comment on the issue of men outside with prolapsed anything but I take the point that we take the gynaecology issue seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#N01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kilian McGrane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I call Ms Mary Leahy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#O00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Before that, what about the chain of command?

The first relates to item No. 7 of the list of actions which were to have commenced by the first quarter of 2018.  This was that \"additional supports are provided to pregnant women from vulnerable, disadvantaged groups or ethnic minorities, and take account of the family's determinants of health, e.g. socioeconomic circumstances\" and the action to be taken was to develop a plan to support vulnerable women and families antenatally and women, families and infants postnatally in conjunction with the local socio-economic inclusion team.  Speaking as a practising public health nurse, we see more and more homeless pregnant women and mums.  A lot of families are in hotels and we are noticing obvious negative health effects.  New babies and toddlers are not achieving the milestones expected of their age because they are living in hotels and accommodation that is inappropriate for young families.  This is a serious issue that is becoming commonplace and I do not see any actions in respect of it.  I wanted to raise that issue.<\/p> <p>  I want to hone in on what Ms Phil N&iacute; Sh&eacute;aghdha stated.  This strategy sought the recruitment of 96 midwives per year by five years but we are more than one year into it and not alone have we not recruited the 96 midwives but we have a deficit of 16, which could be interpreted as a deficit of 112.  This strategy cannot be implemented without the recruitment of midwives.  All of the Deputies and Senators raised the issue of why and we spoke about pay and other conditions, but it is a chicken-and-egg scenario.  If we do not pay people properly, we will not recruit and if we do not recruit, the workload is phenomenal and there is a massive burnout and demoralisation in the workplace as a result.<\/p> <p>  Let me say to members, as politicians, that it is no longer possible to preside over a system which pays nurses and midwives between 12% and 20% less than every other four-year honours degree graduate.  It is a disgrace.  We ask if it is because we are predominantly female or that the Government has got away with it too long.  We have asked so many questions but the time has come where this cannot be allowed to prevail.  As a first step we are seeking parity with colleagues who at entry level have a four-year honours degree.<\/p> <p>  The issue of risk was mentioned as well.  All of the international research shows that the risk of mortality and morbidity rises substantially for every one less nurse or midwife on a shift or ward.  That in itself is a risk.  We aspire to one midwife to every 29.5 births when we are nowhere near it.  We are between 1:35 and 1:40.  As a public health nurse in the community, I can tell members that we are severely short on public health nurses as well.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I will refer to my medical colleagues, the issue of goodwill and the fact that the unpaid-for hours is definitely an issue in medicine.  It is a massive issue in nursing and midwifery as well.  We have proved that through auditing our hours.  We are giving massively of free hours in midwifery and nursing and that goodwill is not sustainable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy Durkan a short question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#O00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":481,"content":"<p>It is not a short one; it is a fundamental one.

If a person is directing maternity services in the country and there is a glitch somewhere in the system, he or she needs to know about it.  He or she also needs to do something about it.  If he or she cannot do something about it, we need to know why - apart from money, which is one of the things that comes into it all the time.

As I just stated a moment ago, it is important to state that the programme is not clinically responsible for the delivery of the service in any individual unit.  It would not be feasible or practical.  Our role is in monitoring, oversight and design of the system.  It is slightly different from the normal chain of command.  If something does not happen in an individual institution, it is a matter for the master of a maternity hospital or the general manager or the CEO of a general hospital.<\/p><p>If we were to separate them, we would make it impossible to deliver quality services.  My two colleagues who have worked as masters would also say this and I have been the CEO of a hospital.  If somebody sitting outside the institution was to take accountability, the system would break down.  However, it is exactly as has been said and we must be notified when issues emerge.  We can add real value when the design of the maternity networks means that individual units no longer just look at their own practice; it is looked at in the context of others.  If we take a hospital group such as Saolta which has five units, it compares data across the five units.  We then meet it and compare its data with those for the other five maternity networks in the system.  In that way we hope to start to identify an emerging trend because it may not be a trend in an individual unit or even a group but it may be across the country.  That is where we come in.  It is the ability to provide scrutiny at local, network, group and national level that will provide a different approach to how the service is managed.  That is what is set out from a governance and leadership perspective in the maternity strategy and it is what we aspire to do.

For Ireland, we could possibly divide each of these figures by ten to get a guesstimate.

This does not just go on for one or two months; it can go on for two years, while all of the investigations are being carried out.  It has a huge impact on recruitment because when someone is working alongside colleagues, he or she sees that they are quite distressed as a result of an incident occurring.

We receive notification of a birth; we know within 24 hours that a birth has occurred and that the family are homeless.  Invariably social services are involved in the internatal stage, but we do not see any evidence of social work community support postnatally.  The mother will have some connection with the maternity hospital whereby she can access a social worker for a period of time, but it is very brief.  We do not really have social workers in the community.  There is also a shortage of public health nurses.<\/p> <p>  On how it affects families, initially the mother and the family endure understandable psychological distress at the fact that they are homeless.  There is a sense of shame and failure and all that comes with it.  Very often, they are placed in a hotel immediately after birth and would not necessarily be in the same hotel they were in antenatally.  They are moving into a completely new environment immediately after having a baby, which brings its own risks.  It is a high-risk period for any mother after delivering a baby.  Very often, the hotel is located in a geographical area not known to the family.  In addition, we are noticing a massive nutritional and dietetic effect because in the contract with the hotel the accommodation paid for by the HSE is possibly on a bed and breakfast only basis.  We notice that the family are given a fry every morning, but there is no provision for an evening meal or dinner.  We also notice that mothers are relying on commercial foods for infants and baby rice in jars with no provision of facilities to heat them.  We are getting involved in negotiations with hotel staff to see whether they can swap a breakfast for an evening meal which is more nutritious.  A breakfast could be cooked in a room.  Porridge is easy to make and more nutritious than a full fry every morning seven days a week.  We are involved at this level of negotiations to try to do a deal with hotels in order that families can eat better because there are massive implications in terms of obesity, poor child nutrition and socialisation associated with diet and eating.<\/p> <p>  Another issue I have seen is that gross motor development is delayed in infants because mothers, understandably, do not want to put them down on the carpet in the hotel room because they do not know how long it has been in place and who has been on it before them.  We are encouraging them to get more towels to leave them on the floor to let the baby down on the ground to move and achieve the milestones expected at the various times we assess babies such as at two weeks and three months.  We notice that speech and language and gross motor development are delayed.  We also notice psychological distress in the mother which invariably impacts on the rest of the family.  We also notice nutritional, dietetic and psychosocial effects.  It impacts on the networking supports of which the families could invariably avail if they were living in the community.  Very often, they are moved to another hotel or temporary accommodation after a period of time such that they are not able to develop the supports available.  This is becoming very common.  Two years ago it was rare, but now I see it regularly and I am covering an affluent area.  It has nothing to do with the socioeconomic group being covered but with where the hotels are located.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I assume the breastfeeding rate is very low, given the associated stress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#P00800","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#P00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>There must be huge hygiene issues in washing bottles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#P01000","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Massive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#P01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I cannot even think what it is like if someone has a two year old and a new child is roaring.

It was also mentioned that there is a quality and safety manager in each unit and a serious incident management forum.  Do they exist at the moment or are they planned?  In respect of Dr. Boylan and the governance model, the opening statement referred to maternity leads, if they do not have authority, not being held responsible or that they should not have the same level of responsibility.  I presume that compares the mastership model to other models.  Perhaps that might be expanded upon.  <\/p><p> If our maternity hospitals become co-located with general hospitals, as is planned over the next number of years, will that lead to better working conditions and improve the ability to recruit and retain staff?  Will that be a factor?  What are the differences between a midwifery-led service as opposed to the standard service?  Dr. Boylan referenced a possibility of conflict between doctors and midwives in his opening statement, depending on the model of care and in particular the supported model of care.  <\/p><p> I also refer to open disclosure.  We are looking at open disclosure legislation in the Oireachtas and a Bill going through at the moment.  Would open disclosure in a timely fashion decrease the number of cases being taken?  It appears information is very slow to come out in relation to adverse incidents and timely open disclosure may obviate litigation.  Should there also be a mandatory inquest into all maternity deaths?  Again, legislation in the D&aacute;il proposes that this would be the case, which does not seem to happen at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#P01600","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Could I take the last point first?

The mastership model is crystal clear.  The master is responsible for running the hospital in a corporate sense.  He or she has overall responsibility.  The master cannot be responsible for every single thing that happens but is, in a corporate sense, responsible for everything that happens in the hospital.  That includes the financial management of the hospital.  The master is not an accountant and does not have huge financial knowledge but is responsible for it.  He or she has people to help, such as accountants and financial managers and so on.  It is the same way with the administration, midwifery and nursing side of things.  There is a director of nursing and midwifery who is responsible for that.  All those people report to the master.  If one is running a ship, one needs a captain.  If one is running a team, one needs a captain.  There has to be one person who is responsible and accountable and has the authority to do things.  That person reports to the board.  The master is accountable to the board, which owns the hospital in trust.  The board does not have any financial interest in the hospital but owns it in trust.  It is a good system and it works.  The board system in the maternity hospitals works because there are people from different backgrounds - legal, financial, property and so on - who are there <i>pro bono<\/i>to give advice on the running of the hospital.  It is a system that could be introduced in some way into HSE hospitals and into the hospital groups and networks.  The board is made up of people who rotate and do not stay on it forever.<br\/><br\/>Will co-location improve conditions?  It probably will.  It will certainly improve the conditions for the mothers, women and persons coming through the hospitals.  That is very important.  It is important to understand that the traditions and <i>esprit de corps <\/i>in the stand-alone maternity hospitals in many of the units around the country is very important and sometimes that gets lost in a new building.  It is an important thing to consider.  If the conditions improve, retention will be easier.  I made reference to the importance of avoiding conflict with midwives in developing the three models of care and made reference to places outside the country.  What I was referring to was the mid-Staffordshire Morecambe Bay problem where a group of midwives were working very much on their own and achieving normal birth at any cost.  Unfortunately that cost worked out to be the death of babies and mothers.  It is really important we make sure we continue the good tradition of midwives and doctors working together in the Irish system and that we regard obstetricians as midwives who also look after more complicated pregnancies.  That is the way to approach it.  We have good relations and I hope they will continue.<br\/><br\/>The new office is a tremendously positive development and will enhance care.  We have already seen some of the things being developed in the area of audit and quality and safety being very helpful. <br\/><br\/>Open disclosure means that one sits down with the couple or patient who has had an adverse outcome and try to explain what has happened.  One may not be able to give a full explanation because, as Dr. McKenna said, one is waiting for post mortem results.  One of the difficulties is that once it goes into the legal arena, there is a tremendous division and one is not allowed to approach the couple or the patient any more.  That is a big problem.  In that respect, mediation is a much better way forward in dealing with medico-legal cases than the adversarial way we have at the moment which is hugely expensive, time-consuming and awful for the patients and the couple involved.  It is a nightmare for them.  It is hard enough looking after a child with a disability but to have to go through all of that as well on top is terrible.  All maternal deaths should have an inquest.  That should go without saying.  It is a statutory inquiry into what happened and I do not see any reason for arguing against it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Boylan.

As Ms Dunne said earlier, it helps with reinforcing recruitment retention, policy, good practice and all the things that have been confirmed as benefiting the service from a leadership point of view.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about whether co-location has assisted recruitment and retention.  The only example we can look to is the Cork model.  Right now the general and maternity services are equally as bad.  One of the benefits is that a closer postgraduate education can be encouraged.  Neonatology and ICU services can work more closely together and look at training modules that assist both.<\/p><p>We have a huge shortage of midwives in neonatology units.  That again comes back to an increasing requirement.  With reference to what Dr. Boylan said about the authority, currently, if one could describe our services as anything, it is that one has hospital groups which have the stand alone maternity services within each group which also has a separate governance structure.  Likewise, one has general hospitals, voluntary hospitals with separate governance structures.  One has multiplicities of governance structures and it is very difficult to see where the authority lies.  Our members would say regularly that we have all the responsibility but none of the authority and authority is the key.  We need to know who is in charge and who is making the decision and whether they have fiscal control.  One of the big criticisms that directors of midwifery bring forward is that, in many instances, they do not.  They have all the risk responsibility but none of the authority to fire, to hire, to recruit and to make the service better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022100002#R01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I have one final question and it is one we are grappling with in relation our Sl&aacute;intecare report.

That will dictate how much of the strategy one can deliver in the next year.  It is not a capital plan.  We are talking about a day-to-day spend.  This year we went to the launch of the HSE's service plan and we were told that we were going to have to find savings of &euro;320 million.  How does that marry with a service modernisation and a service development?  Yearly service planning is a huge impediment.

We mentioned earlier on the issue about budgets.  Does one separate budgets out on the basis of a clinical directorate model like maternity, or does one leave them embedded in the individual institutions?  Moving from stand alone institutions into networks, whether they are clinical networks or governance networks, is problematic and the blueprint is not as clear for maternity.  It is very clear that we have six and we are trying to work through that.  We are encountering some difficulties as we move along but it is not insurmountable.  When one looks at it on a broader scale, what is the infrastructure that will support the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare?  Is the hospital groups and community health organisations, CHOs, aligned or not?

I said it would impose an unnecessary burden on SMEs at a time when we should be doing everything we could to help them by reducing regulation and red tape.  I also said it was unfair on the auditors of small companies to have to perform audits of companies that were almost too small to audit in the first instance.  Many of them have only one or two members of staff.  The loss of the exemption will also apply where a company misses an annual return deadline with the Companies Registration Office where, for example, a director suffers a serious illness or there is a death in the family.  These are issues that come up every day of the week and challenges faced by small companies.<\/p> <p>  During the debate on Second Stage Deputies also received communications from some of the accountancy bodies outlining some of their concerns about the legislation.  I am concerned about section 9 on the basis of what has been said.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the fact that the accountancy bodies perceive the proposed changes as a misuse of the audit function.  They argue that we will be out of step with the rest of the European Union and that the changes will impose an additional administrative burden on the SME sector.  They also point out that the cost of going to the High Court will be prohibitive for most small companies and will overly penalise them in their day to day functioning.  It is on that basis that Fianna F&aacute;il is opposing sections 9 and 10.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018022100002#B00800","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speech","time":1519224300,"counter":550,"content":"<p>While I accept the spirit of what Deputy Niall Collins has said, I ask him to withdraw his opposition to the section for now.  During the debate on Second Stage I promised to consider the points made on the issue both during the debate and in representations I had received directly since the Bill had been published.  Clearly, there are legitimate concerns where a company finds itself unable to file on time, but we should be able to find a way to address some of them.  However, any way forward must also ensure the interests of third parties will be protected and not undermined by reduced transparency.<\/p> <p>  One aspect that strikes me is the way in which the loss of the audit exemption is applied in law.  The position could be improved.  In particular, the costs involved and burden imposed could be reduced by changing the years to which it applies.  Currently, there is a need to go back in time, but the accounting and audit profession has made representations to the Department, as recently as this week, to the effect that making the audit more contemporary would save time and reduce costs.  I intend to bring forward proposals on Report Stage for the introduction of measures to reduce the cost and lessen the impact of some of the more burdensome aspects of losing the audit exemption.  I am also looking at ways by which we could further streamline the annual filing process.  There may be scope to reduce or change the steps associated with filing such that there would be fewer reasons for a company to file late.  I intend to consider amendments that would simplify the filing process and hope to be able to bring them forward on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  In summary, we are looking at removing the requirement to make an application to the District Court.  Companies will be allowed to file late, but they will lose their audit exemption and will have to have their accounts audited.  However, audits will take place for the current and following year, which will remove the necessity to file documents for an historical audit.  Companies have 28 days in which to file and a further 28 days in which to make a subsequent filing.  We may change that figure and give companies 56 days in which to file their final statements and annual return.  That is what I am hoping to bring forward on Report Stage, having considered what the Deputy has said.  I hope that is acceptable to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018022100002#B00900","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1519224300,"counter":551,"content":"<p>We will withdraw our opposition to the section for now on the understanding the Minister will bring forward amendments on Report Stage.

There are three types of such an agreement, as provided for in sections 33, 35 and 45 .  Section 33 provides that the IAASA may enter into such agreements with a prescribed accountancy body or a recognised accountancy body.  These are agreements to settle cases of non-compliance by a body in respect of the application of the disciplinary process by a prescribed accountancy body and how a recognised accountancy body is performing the audit oversight tasks for which it is responsible.  Section 35 provides that the IAASA may enter into such agreements directly with a member of a prescribed accountancy body, a statutory auditor or an audit firm.  These are agreements to settle cases of breaches of the standards of a prescribed accountancy body or of the rules governing statutory audit.  Section 45 provides that the Director of Corporate Enforcement may enter into such an agreement with a director of a public interest entity where that director has contributed to a breach of the rules of statutory audit by a statutory auditor or audit firm.<\/p><p> All these agreements share some characteristics.  For a start, the terms of this type of agreement are binding on the IAASA or the Director of Corporate Enforcement on the one hand and on the accountancy body, auditor or director concerned on the other.  They may include sanctions, such as a financial penalty.  Depending on the circumstances, an agreement may be entered into without an investigation or inquiry having first been initiated.  They are at the absolute discretion of the parties concerned.  The IAASA or the director, as appropriate, shall publish the details of any agreement on its website as soon as is practicable.  The purpose of these agreements is to avoid lengthy and costly proceedings while ensuring the appropriate regulatory outcomes.<\/p><p> The purpose of amendments Nos. 3, 7 and 18 is to clarify that these agreements may be reached without the need to initiate an inquiry under section 933, or an investigation under section 934 or an investigation under Part 15 of the Companies Act 2014, as appropriate.  Amendments Nos. 4, 8 and 19 clarify that while the terms of these agreements may include the imposition of sanctions and the payment of costs, they are not limited to these terms.  Amendments Nos. 5, 9 and 20 are purely technical to allow for amendments Nos. 6, 10 and 21, respectively.  Amendments Nos. 6, 10 and 21 clarify that this type of agreement does not require the confirmation of the court, as provided for in section 941 of the Companies Act 2014 and in new section 957I, which is inserted by this Bill.  This is because the agreements are at the absolute discretion of both parties to them.  Amendments Nos. 10 and 21 also insert new subsections into sections 934E and 957E, respectively, to the effect that the IAASA or the Director of Corporate Enforcement, as appropriate, shall publish the details of these agreements on its website as soon as practicable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018022100002#B02800","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519224300,"counter":570,"content":"<p>The particulars of the relevant contravention and the relevant sanction will be published on the website.

Amendment No. 13 is purely technical to permit amendment No. 14 to be made.  Amendment No. 14 inserts five new subsections into the new section 936B which is concerned with the matters that the IAASA must communicate to the CEAOB.  The EU audit directive requires the IAASA to communicate immediately to the CEAOB certain sanctions imposed on statutory auditors or audit firms or directors of public interest entities.  As some of these sanctions may have been imposed by the recognised accountancy bodies, the IAASA will rely on those bodies for this information.<\/p><p>Accordingly, amendment No. 14 inserts a new subsection (3) to clarify that a recognised accountancy body must inform the IAASA immediately of any temporary prohibition imposed by it on a statutory auditor or audit firm that prohibits it from carrying out audits or signing audit reports, and from performing functions in audit firms or public interest entities.  Amendment No. 14 also inserts a new subsection (4) which clarifies that there is a similar obligation on the IAASA to submit this information onwards to the CEAOB immediately.  As well as this urgent type of information, the EU audit directive also requires the IAASA to provide aggregated information annually on all sanctions and measures imposed under the EU audit directive for publication in the CEAOB&rsquo;s annual report.  This amendment therefore  inserts a new subsection (5) to clarify that a recognised accountancy body must also give the IAASA annually all such equivalent sanctions and measures it has imposed.  Similarly, the amendment inserts a new subsection (6) which clarifies that there is a like obligation on the IAASA to submit this information onwards to the CEAOB as soon as may be.  Finally, the amendment inserts a new subsection (7) to clarify that with regard to sanctions in the case of the recognised accountancy bodies, these are the sanctions imposed by them on statutory auditors who are members of that body or in respect of whom the body has been designated oversight functions.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 23 is technical and related.  It inserts a cross reference to the EU directive to clarify that the obligation on recognised accountancy bodies to ensure that they can impose penalties on auditors includes the imposition of these temporary prohibitions as provided for in Article 30a(1)(c) and (e) of the directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018022100002#C02900","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519224300,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1519224300,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<\/p><blockquote>In page 41, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:&ldquo;(3) A recognised accountancy body shall immediately communicate to the Supervisory Authority particulars of any temporary prohibition referred to in point (c) or (e) of Article 30a(1) of the Audit Directive imposed by the body on a relevant person.<br \/><br \/>(4) The Supervisory Authority shall immediately communicate to the CEAOB particulars which have been communicated to it under subsection (3).<br \/><br \/>(5) Without prejudice to the generality of sections 1523 and 1556, a recognised accountancy body shall, as soon as may be after the end of a year, give to the Supervisory Authority aggregated information in relation to&mdash;<blockquote>(a) all sanctions equivalent to relevant sanctions imposed by it on relevant persons during the year in accordance with Part 27, and<br \/><br \/>(b) all notices equivalent to public notices of the sanctions first-mentioned in paragraph (a) imposed by it on relevant persons during the year in accordance with Part 27.<\/blockquote>(6) The Supervisory Authority shall, as soon as may be after it is given the information referred to in subsection (5), give the information to the CEAOB.<br \/><br \/>(7) In this section, &lsquo;relevant person&rsquo;, in relation to a recognised accountancy body, means&mdash;<blockquote>(a) a member of the body, or<br \/><br \/>(b) an auditor or audit firm in relation to whom, by virtue of section 930C, the body may perform functions,<\/blockquote>who is a statutory auditor or former statutory auditor.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018022100002#C03100","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519224300,"counter":600,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519224300,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Section 37, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519224300,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Section 38 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519224300,"counter":603,"content":"<p>SECTION 39<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1519224300,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p><blockquote>In page 41, to delete lines 27 to 31 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(c) by the substitution of the following subsections for subsections (4) and (5):<blockquote>&ldquo;(4) Subject to subsection (5), the Supervisory Authority may make regulations respecting the procedures to be followed in conducting enquiries under section 933 and investigations under section 934 or 935.<br \/><br \/>(5) There is no obligation to make regulations under subsection (4) with respect to a particular provision referred to in that subsection.&rdquo;, and&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>This amendment is technical to provide for transitional matters relating to hearings, privileges and procedural rules of the IAASA.

I have circulated an opening statement and I will try to get through it briefly.  The references to specific sections are just an aid to members.<\/p> <p>  The Bill has been proposed by me and Deputy Pearse Doherty.  The ability to bring about litigation of the kind alluded to in the legislation would be of very significant value to a wide variety of potential applicants.  It could increase access to justice significantly and open up avenues that did not exist previously for many affected by particular injuries and injustices.  In the first instance, I will note that there are forms of group litigation already in Ireland, but none of the kind proposed, and that all have some deficiencies.  In particular, the representative case model provides only injunctive and declaratory relief.  It is not possible to seek damages, which is a major deficiency.<\/p> <p>  An model on which our witnesses are likely to have considerable knowledge is the test-case model.  The option for persons involved is for a test case to proceed and related cases to follow subsequently on the basis of that precedent.  This is a real route that can realise damages and other remedies, and it has been used extensively in Irish courts.  This model has significant drawbacks, however.<\/p><p>Most significant, the person taking a test case faces the very significant consideration of costs being awarded against them and being liable for that amount on their own.  This is a disincentive to taking any case, particularly people who may be on limited incomes or dealing with debt already, such as someone in mortgage arrears.<\/p><p> The issue of legal representation and duplication of legal costs is also relevant.  It also means that the person taking the case has no direct responsibility to others in the same or similar situations and those persons do not have to be notified.  It is essentially a single case on a single set of facts, even if the Judiciary has creatively and pragmatically used the model to deal with groups of cases.  It is also not possible to calculate the potential overall liability of all cases in the class of cases under this model.  This is not ideal for plaintiff or defendant.<\/p><p> The Law Reform Commission, LRC, paper on which this Bill is based states, &ldquo;The test case approach encourages, even if it does not validate, the multiplication rather than the division of costs for the generic issue among the members of the group.\"  There is clearly a real need for such legislation.  It can, I believe, be of huge benefit to our legal system and to many citizens.  I am looking forward to engaging with this session to see how we can improve it and amend it.  I hope that this will be an evolving process.  I wish to say that I am very open to suggestions and amendments, not only from my colleagues on the Committee on Justice and Equality but also from the expert witnesses.<\/p><p> I want to offer some brief observations on the submissions I have received.  I was going to address some of the criticisms levelled by the Government during Second Stage, but I believe the submissions by Dr. Blennerhassett and by the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, address quite a number of those criticisms.  An issue about costs was raised by both Dr. Blennerhassett and FLAC.  I would be supportive of the idea of civil legal aid in principle, and I did note the draft Bill in the LRC paper.  However, as that would involve a charge on the Exchequer, it would not be possible for me, as an Opposition spokesperson, to have included that in the Bill and to move it.  It is certainly something to which I am very open.  Dr. Blennerhassett raises some very interesting points in her submission on changes to the manner in which costs are decided, especially where costs follow the event and in terms of conditional fee arrangements.  I would be interested in learning more about that.<\/p><p> A point was made in both the debate and in some of the submissions about tracker mortgages, and I note that Dr. Blennerhassett has identified that it could be complicated and that there may be better routes, although FLAC has submitted that it could be a viable route to seeking redress.  In any event, I have instanced that to a large extent as an example rather than necessarily the only circumstances in which it would be relevant.  There is a significant amount of discussion of other remedies, for example, alternative dispute resolution and ombudsman and regulatory redress.  They are areas of interest.  I also note that the civil law review will not consider those.  I would be open to hearing more about those solutions, but ultimately a route such as this legal route will be necessary.  There are also points concerning settlement, and I am open to views on that.  Dr. Blennerhassett makes the point well that tensions and differing expectations are inevitable within a group and that it may be necessary for a judge or regulator to approve a settlement.  Again, this is an area that I am open to considering further.  A point is also made about existing cases, and I am willing to take on board that it may well be the case that retrospection could be a difficulty, but that is a matter that we can discuss further.<\/p><p> Dr. Coleman's submission contains very interesting proposals.  I am particularly open to the idea that the register should predate the proceedings on the basis of cost reduction, and we can explore that further, and also the proposed redrafting of the points made on costs which relates to section 9.<\/p><p> I look forward to hearing the submissions and views of members.  I might ask Deputy Pearse Doherty to make a brief comment on the Bill in general before we open the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018022100002#G00300","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":664,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has outlined the contents of the Bill and its importance, and his own openness, as lead sponsor of the Bill, to take amendments from both witnesses and other colleagues across the political divide.

It is clear that we are not the only outlier in the European Union, but compared with our peers, we are an outlier in not providing this type of course of action to litigants.  I was prompted to look into the issue because of the tracker mortgage scandal, where victim after victim was left to argue and wonder if they had another kind of course of redress through the courts whereby they were able to take on the Goliaths of the financial institutions to get them to address the difficulties and the challenges they faced after having lost so much money as a result of the tracker mortgage scandal.  Their own personal assets were put on the line.  In those circumstances many wondered if they could have looked at a class action, multi-party type of suit.  When we scrutinised that issue, we found that the Law Reform Commission had indeed recommended this back in 2005.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has taken the time to pen this legislation based on those recommendations at the time and that the D&aacute;il has passed that legislation to this Stage.

We are also grateful to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality for giving detailed consideration to this access to justice issue, and we would like to stress that FLAC is very happy to provide any assistance it can to the committee on this and other issues.  We have submitted quite a number of detailed documents setting out the work of FLAC and its experience of multi-party actions, especially in the area of the implementation of the social welfare equal treatment directive and the recent collective complaint to the Council of Europe.  I do not intend to reiterate what is already before the committee.<\/p> <p>  While FLAC welcomes the Bill, our biggest concern at the moment is that there is no legal aid for multi-party litigation.  That needs to be addressed to make the Bill effective, particularly for people on low incomes or potential claimants whose potential damage may be just too low for a private firm to take on the risk.  The Bill clearly envisages that proceedings should be issued, and I welcome the suggestion that it may be possible to amend that to have a register.  Even if it was the case that a person could join the proceedings by simply joining the register, that person will still need legal advice as to whether he or she should or should not.  It is a critical issue that legal aid and legal advice would be available.<\/p> <p>  The LRC in its report addressed this issue in annex B with a very simple amendment to the Civil Legal Aid Act which provides that multi-party actions should not be excluded.  For the purposes of this oral presentation we have been invited to comment on the Government's criticism of the Bill, as expressed by the Minister of State, and that is what I will do.<\/p> <p>  It has been suggested that the Bill is technically flawed in that it seeks, inappropriately, to enact as primary legislation a scheme that was intended by the LRC to be in the form of rules of the Superior Courts.<\/p><p>The Superior Court Rules Committee has the power, exercisable with the agreement of the Minister for Justice and Equality, to make and change the rules of the superior courts.  It appears that the Law Reform Commission envisaged reform by way of the rules committee rather than primary legislation.  However, there is nothing in principle or law to prevent changes from being brought about by primary legislation.  We believe it would be constitutionally suspect if the Oireachtas were in some way to be disbarred from introducing legislation to seek to improve access to justice in the absence of the Superior Courts Rules Committee making such rules for whatever reason.  Nevertheless, it may be more appropriate to include in the Bill a provision that procedural rules would be adopted to give effect to the provisions of the Bill.  It is not necessary to exclude the Superior Courts Rules Committee and the Bill could be amended to provide that the committee would make procedural rules. <\/p><p> We have also been asked to address the issue of tracker mortgages.  The overarching point in that regard is that the tracker mortgage scandal was clearly the catalyst for publication of the Bill.  Irrespective of whether multi-party actions are an appropriate way to deal with the tracker mortgage issue or whether there is a more efficient redress system available, this does not take from the fact that we do not have formal effective procedures for multi-party litigation.  The Bill is a significant improvement and development in that regard.  There is no doubt that issues will arise in the future which would benefit from having this legislation in place. <\/p><p> It is not clear that the redress programme in place would achieve the resolution of all tracker mortgage cases, particularly the more egregious cases where repossession proceedings have been brought or family homes repossessed.  If the procedure provided for had been in place when the tracker mortgage scandal emerged in 2011-12, it is arguable and certainly possible that some of the issues could have been addressed by now through such litigation.<\/p><p> The Government's statement queried whether multi-party actions were a viable way to deal with tracker mortgage issues.  Clearly, there are different types of plaintiff, claim and lender involved and the losses incurred also differ.  However, the core issue of overcharging on interest creates a commonality.  While multi-party actions may not be the best procedure or even a necessary one for every claim arising from the tracker mortgage scandal, it is difficult to argue that they would not be a suitable vehicle for at least some of the claims. <\/p><p> The Government's statement noted that the report of the Law Reform Commission was relatively old and that it would be appropriate to consider developments that had occurred in the meantime, in particular, at European level and internationally.  While FLAC agrees that it is wholly appropriate to consider these developments, none of them suggests the current lack of provision for multi-party actions is in any way justified or should be maintained.  Most recently, the EU anti-trust damages directive which relates to damages under national law for breaches of EU competition law makes provision for collective redress.  It has also been suggested the matter will be addressed by the President of the High Court in the review of the administration of civil justice.  While it is welcome that the President of the High Court will consider this matter as part of the review, we hope his review will go beyond multi-party actions and examine other barriers to access to justice, for example, class actions, standing rules on costs and protective costs and other forms of resolution of matters.  It would be unfortunate if the review were, in some way, to inhibit the Oireachtas i legislating on matters related to access to justice.<\/p><p> Some technical issues were raised by the Government about the Bill.  FLAC is not overly concerned with a number of them.  It is correct that an element of the Law Reform Commission's proposal is admitted, namely, the requirement that any person joining a multi-party scheme agrees at or before the time he or she joins it to the terms of any settlement arrangement.  This matter could easily be rectified and I am not sure it is a critical issue.<\/p><p> Concern is also expressed about the designation of a lead solicitor under a Bill and whether this could, in some way, impinge on the right of access to the courts by an individual with a legal representative of his or her choice.  It must remembered that the parties are opting into this system which is in no way compulsory and that the High Court judge will have a key role in ensuring the lead case fairly and adequately represents the interests of all those on the register.  <\/p><p> A further concern is raised about whether it would be considered safer for any such Bill to apply to new proceedings only.  On my reading of the Bill, it is not immediately clear that it purports to apply to existing proceedings.  It is important to remember that it would not change substantive rights or even substantive remedies.  It is more a case management Bill than one which would change existing rights.  Again, that concern is not a critical issue.<\/p><p> The Law Reform Commission has subjected this matter to considerable scrutiny and analysis.  It is clear from its report that it considers the proposal to be an alternative rather than a radical one.  While the Bill clearly is not the solution to remove all barriers to access to justice, it attempts to deal with some of them.  For that reason, FLAC welcomes it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018022100002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Eilis Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":668,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Barry and invite Mr. Coleman to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018022100002#J00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":669,"content":"<p>While I am happy to make my contribution now, perhaps it might be more beneficial if Dr. Blennerhassett were to speak about the generality of the system and we were to discuss the empirical experience thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018022100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave Coleman"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":670,"content":"<p>Is Dr. Blennerhassett agreeable to that suggestion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018022100002#J00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":671,"content":"<p>Yes.

It is a pleasure to speak to the joint committee.  <\/p> <p>  I am a legal consultant and law lecturer with a background in practice as a solicitor.  I have been researching multi-party actions and the issue of collective redress for the past ten years.  My doctoral research entailed a comparative examination of multi-party actions in a number of common law jurisdictions and I also examined Ireland's procedures for collective redress.  I compiled my findings on the uses of multi-party actions in other jurisdictions and how they could potentially be of use here in a book which may be of assistance to the joint committee. <\/p> <p>  I propose to discuss Ireland's current system for delivering collective redress and outline the problems with it.  In my written submission I respond to the Government's criticism of the Bill, as outlined by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  Owing to time constraints, I do not propose to set out my responses in detai,l but I would welcome questions Deputies may have on them.  I also offer my assistance in any way I can with the legislation. <\/p> <p>  I will begin by examining the idea of mass harm, which is what multi-party actions, MPAs, are designed to resolve.  Mass harm is severe or widespread damage which usually causes harm to many victims.  We are all potential victims of mass harm which has become a feature of modern life.  Ireland needs a legal procedure that can respond to the legal challenge presented by this reality.  Thirteen years have elapsed since the Law Reform Commission published its report on multi-party actions, which is too long a period without change.  The matter needs to be addressed urgently.  For this reason, I am glad that the committee is examining legislation on the matter.<\/p> <p>  In the opinion of Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness, president of the Law Reform Commission when it issued its report on multi-party actions, the Irish methods of dealing with multiple cases have led to \"appalling situations because of the lack of multi-party actions\".  In recent years there have been numerous cases of mass harm in Ireland, including the Volkswagen emissions scandal, pyrite damage, contaminated blood products, Army deafness claims, asbestos-related ill health and the recent tracker mortgage rate abuse by banks.  Ireland is one of the few common law jurisdictions that does not yet have an effective mechanism for multi-party litigation.  Instead, the courts occasionally use a confusing array of alternative methods in cases where a multi-party action mechanism would have an obvious role.<\/p><p>It would appear that the MPA litigation is necessary as a remedy of last resort where the other techniques failed to deliver collective redress and where there is, therefore, no alternative but resort to the courts.<br\/><br\/>MPAs, by enabling victims of mass harm to combine their legal actions, can be a key tool in achieving access to justice.  Litigants can overcome many of the impediments that they face in taking legal actions individually.  It gives strength in numbers.  It allows them to pool their resources because very often they deal with David versus Goliath-type scenarios.<br\/><br\/>I will now discuss the current Irish mechanisms for dealing with mass harm, which I believe are inadequate.  These are private actions and multi-party procedures that currently fall short of MPAs.  They are rarely invoked because they are of such restricted use.  The first mechanism is representative actions.  The Irish courts have taken a very restrictive attitude towards them.  They are only allowed in very limited circumstances where parties have the same interest and where certain prerequisites are met.  They cannot be used for tort claims.  Most of the cases that I have talked about today are tort claims.  It is not possible to get damages and crucially, it is not possible to get legal aid.  <br\/><br\/>The remaining tools are joinder and consolidation, which are technical ways of joining cases, and finally we have test cases.  These are commonly used and are unduly costly.  They also result in procedural inefficiency, as well as unnecessary duplication.  In addition, the risk of adverse cost awards, on which my colleague, Ms Barry, has spoken, and potentially ruinous costs make them very unfavourable. <br\/><br\/>I will examine a few of the cases that exemplify the problems of mass harm litigation in Ireland.  They show the problems that can occur when some of these procedures I have just mentioned are used and there is no MPA procedure.  There is huge inefficiency in terms of financial terms and delay.  By proceeding on the basis of these fragmented and piecemeal procedures, access to justice is impeded, there are gross procedural inefficiencies and there is procedural unfairness.<br\/><br\/>We have had the social welfare equality cases, the Army deafness claims, and the best recent example is the pyrite construction dispute.  The latter ended in 2011 and ran for more than two years with claims of more than 550 homeowners.  It was the longest-running case in the history of the Commercial Court and one of the most expensive court cases in the history of the State.  Each plaintiff had to take a separate action and they all had to instruct their own lawyers.  This case typifies the problems inherent in the current procedures whereby plaintiffs must initiate separate and individual claims and seek damages at huge cost, delay and causing wasteful inefficiencies.  I believe that these examples show that it is in the interests of the State, litigants and of justice to embrace some form of multi-party action procedure to avoid these anomalous cases.  Such a procedure would enhance access to justice and help overcome the obstacles such as the high litigation costs faced by individuals.  Another key factor is that it would make mass litigation more manageable and allow case management.<br\/><br\/>There are particular difficulties with multi-party litigation in Ireland, as my colleague, Ms Barry, has mentioned.  Funding cases is a crucial problem, in particular in respect of legal aid.  We do not have an effective system for legal aid.  As the Irish scheme specifically excludes test cases and multi-party actions of any sort, it is not available for representative actions.  In order to avoid the risk of ruinously expensive legal costs, litigants commonly proceed by using the device of men of straw.  That means litigants will have no assets and nothing to lose financially in an action.Second, litigation insurance is generally not available in Ireland because professional third party funding is not permitted in Ireland as it offends against the rules on maintenance and champerty.  Third, and also crucially, costs follow the event.  That means that the loser of a case usually has to pay the entire amount of the costs.  It is a double financial burden to be obliged to meet both sets of costs in the action.  Were multi-party actions to be introduced, there would have to be changes as to how costs are currently decided.<br\/><br\/>The Law Reform Commission report in 2005 cited Professor Hodges of Oxford University and his call for &quot;a managerial mechanism to move forward resolution of all the individual claims&quot;.  The commission recommended that any reform in this area should be based on principles of procedural fairness, efficiency and access to justice.  In particular, it recommended that there should be active case management by the courts, which I think is key in dealing with large-scale cases.  <br\/><br\/>Let us consider what happened in Europe.  In January, just a few weeks ago, the European Commission published a report on the implementation of its 2013 recommendation on collective redress.  At present, 19 member states in total have implemented collective actions across various sectors.  The report states:<\/p><blockquote>In the Member States where [collective redress mechanisms] do not formally exist there appears to be an increasing tendency of claimants attempting to seek collective redress through the use of different legal vehicles ... This may raise issues concerning effective prevention of abusive litigation.<\/blockquote><p>That particularly applies where there is a lack of safeguards, as provided for in the European Commission's recommendation.  Ireland remains one of eight member states that still do not provide for any possibility to collectively claim compensation in mass harm situations.  <br\/><br\/>In conclusion, it is clear that cases of mass harm and multi-party litigation occur in Ireland.  Due to the lack of an appropriate MPA mechanism, other methods are used by way of improvisation thus causing appalling delays, costs and injustice.  The experience of the victims of Thalidomide, for example, shows that this current practice is causing much difficulty.  The MPA experience in other jurisdictions shows that they can enhance procedural justice in appropriate cases.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that collective actions alone are an outdated approach for dealing with mass harm because they are not the most efficient route to justice.  As we know, the courts are not the only forum in which to resolve legal disputes.  We must also learn lessons from emerging new techniques of collective redress.  We need to adopt a modern holistic approach.  This requires a combination of legal tools, including regulation, alternative dispute resolution, the courts and ombudsmen.<br\/><br\/>In summary, MPA litigation is a necessary remedy of last resort to deal with mass harm where other techniques fail to deliver collective redress.  Mass harm affects a huge number of people, particularly consumers.  Professor Hodges also talked about needing better ways to manage the unmanageable.  Mass harm litigation can become unmanageable and MPAs offer a way of dealing with this.  <br\/><br\/>I believe the current procedures are hugely flawed and cause injustice.  There is no perfect solution to meet the challenge of delivering collective redress.  After 13 years we finally have this legislation that could help manage the reality of mass harm litigation.  The MPA procedure is what the Law Reform Commission recommended after extensive research and consideration.  This Bill is the best option we have at the moment for creating a procedural mechanism to deal with multi-party litigation.  Therefore, I suggest that we do our best to work with the legislation.  It might need some fine tuning, as most legislation does, but let us not lose momentum.  Let us not get left behind in the Dark Ages without an effective multi-party action procedure.  The law is dynamic and we can always incorporate changes and collective redress techniques as they evolve and become available but at the moment they are very limited.  Without doubt, Ireland needs to finally overhaul its collective redress procedures and introduce an MPA procedure to remedy what I see as a severe gap in its legal mechanisms.  I thank the committee members for their attention. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018022100002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne Blennerhassett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Blennerhassett for her presentation.

There is nothing that has been said in this room today that I disagree with and I will continue on from what has been said.<\/p> <p>  I am the founding partner of Coleman Legal Partners and I have specialised in group litigation for the past 30 years.  <\/p> <p>  The use of any judicial system by a group of citizens, and their advisers, with common purpose in the absence of formal court rules to guide them necessarily means a journey by all parties, be they plaintiffs or defendants, that is fraught with risk and exposure to risk that often, in practice, precludes large numbers of people, and their rights have been taken from them without ever being vindicated.  I do not say that from a subjective point for view.  I say it from an empirical point of view as this has been my experience.<\/p> <p>  I have received a copy of the Bill.<\/p><p>While I apologise for having tracked and changed it, I felt it was a way to show the committee that there may be another way to look at the Bill.  While I apologise for the damage I did to it, it was the best way to explain myself.<br\/><br\/>Later in the Bill, there is provision for a judge to decide on more than one lead case, but that is not stated in the definition of the lead case.  The definition refers to a case which may be chosen as representative of the class or group.  In so far as it goes, that seems very logical but already at this point the massive disparity between a plaintiff and the defendant in any case has reared its not too pretty head.  What one sees is not so much what the lead case is but rather who the lead plaintiff is.  That is a massive difference when it comes to the citizen and his or her right of access to justice.  A simple answer is that it is the case which best represents the set of circumstances the court is tasked with deciding.  That is the simple answer.  The practical answer is that the person in the plaintiff case who is the best person in the best position to carry out this case to its ultimate destination must have certain attributes from a practical point of view.  I will explain what they are.  The plaintiff must be willing to go forward as the lead plaintiff and, in effect, do the heavy lifting on his or her own behalf and on behalf of many thousands of others.  In respect of the day-to-day management of the case, he or she must follow absolutely everything.  He or she must be up for it and know what to do, including how to do affidavits and know what that means.  Ultimately, the plaintiff could have the responsibility of carrying the costs where the value of the case being discussed may run to tens of millions of euro.<br\/><br\/>I have done these cases and, thankfully, been successful in most of them.  However, I can speak to the risks that individuals face in this country when seeking to vindicate their rights.  I can speak to the bank cases and the pyrite cases and, by my experience, shed some light for the committee on what this legislation ought to achieve.  The circumstances of the lead plaintiff must be such that the facts of his or her case govern those of the group.  It is a fact of life that not every case will be <i>ad idem<\/i>with its next neighbour.  One is going to try to distil some basic principles out of all of the cases which are enough to decide the group.  There will be a degree of subjectivity, such as the extent of damage etc. on an individual basis.  The last circumstance of this person is the one which everyone has spoken about here.  That is that he or she must be such that he or she can withstand any and all negative costs orders made against them.  It is not just the costs of the case.  During the course of the case, it has been my experience that certain judges have made interim costs orders against lead plaintiffs in respect of late filing of papers, etc.  One might blame the solicitor for that but when one is running a mass tort, one may have several thousand people to deal with and it is not always possible to get it right according to the timeline the judge sets out.<br\/><br\/>We have had to deal with interim costs orders against plaintiffs in those circumstances.  Something should be done about that.  This rule allows any defendant, most of which are large corporations or, indeed, the State, to adopt their first defensive strategy, which is to play the man and not the ball.  They will pick the test plaintiff as the man who has the means to pay their costs or a large portion of them should they win.  If they succeed in getting him nominated, the defendant can, under the current system, apply to the High Court to have its chosen cases in the group litigation taken.  That plaintiff is now on notice and he will worry throughout the case, which gives the defence its first advantage.  One has to ask at this point who in his or her right mind would place what could be the result of his or her life's work on the line to incur the massive liability on behalf of others whom they most likely have never met save with the common interest of a loss they blame others for?  What solicitor would advise someone to take on that risk?  That is a rhetorical question in the sense that the answer highlights immediately the problems any plaintiff and his or her advisers have.  In a case I successfully concluded several years ago on behalf of 300 plaintiffs, the defendants paid out an eight-figure sum.  I cannot name the case or the parties because of the terms of the settlement.  One of the lead plaintiffs was a man of considerable wealth.  He joined the case as an ordinary plaintiff and placed himself in harm's way, knowing a loss would cost him many multiples more than the loss he was complaining of in the first instance.  Notwithstanding the clarity of the advices as to the nature of an adverse costs result, this man stood his ground.  Eventually, he and his fellow plaintiffs were vindicated.  To say his belief in justice caused him and me many sleepless nights is an understatement.  He remains a friend today.<br\/><br\/>No one, including me, wants to see the courts system with any legislation enacted to guide it used for rampant litigation which clogs up the arteries of the system in order to vindicate minor rights of individuals.  We understand this.  This is not what we see as the intention of the legislation.  Neither does anyone want to see citizens precluded from availing of the right of access to court for fear of a draconian costs order, which might ultimately be his or her ruin.  The job of the legislator is to pick through this issue and assist in any process which treats all protagonists equally.  The old costs rule of costs following the event has an exponential effect in multi-party litigation on the single individual who is saddled with the costs of a case taken on behalf of thousands.  This was never intended to be the result of that rule.  The rule demonstrates the stark difference between the realities of the protagonists where the plaintiff is a minor individual, whose opponent is often a multinational or, indeed, the State.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, the appointment of one solicitor, or more than one depending on the size of the case, is a thing to be desired.  The proper execution of a multi-party action requires action by a solicitor with three attributes.  The first is that he or she must have the necessary experience of litigation of this type.  The second is that he or she must have the capacity to administer a case which may have thousands of parties.  The third is that he or she must have the necessary resources to execute the case from inception to conclusion.  The third is interesting and I will speak to it later.  I have often seen and met solicitors in smaller firms who are swamped by a case that has grown legs from its initial birth with one client or so.  The applicability of the facts to a larger cohort has made that solicitor unable to adequately and properly deal with the numbers involved.  Given the adverse nature of a costs order, it may be prudent advice for other solicitors with similar clients in similar situations to wait and see what happens with the lead case.  Everybody is now on the ditch.  It means the resources are limited and applied to a lead case and there is no cohesive strategy to vindicate the rights of people in the most efficient way.  This will compound the lead solicitor's problems if the clients do not come to the case to allow it to be adequately resourced.  We will speak to resources later.<br\/><br\/>The administration of a case is important to all, in particular the clients.  There is of course the lead plaintiff about whom we have spoken but everyone who has suffered as a result of a mass loss has the same right as the lead plaintiff.  However, they must follow on, which means having to be educated in the progress of the case and in its nuances as the defendants often bring forth information or material which heretofore has not been available to plaintiffs and which can change the nature and style of a case.  We will talk about that coming up in the process of discovery later.  In deciding an issue, the court will rightly want to know that those affected by a case are suitably informed of its progress.  Technology has greatly assisted this administration but individuals in the current system all carry a fear of having to pay their own and others' costs.  The majority of queries may have to be dealt with by the solicitor on a one-to-one basis.<\/p><p>People are genuinely scared because of the nature of the current system which involves joint and several liability costs.<br\/><br\/>After allowing for the first two requirements, namely, experience and capacity, the resource most necessary to execute a case is money.  In the multi-party section, there is a reference to the High Court stamp duty of &euro;190 and an Injuries Board application fee of &euro;45.  Taken together, this comes to &euro;235 which might not appear like a large sum which would act in any way as a barrier to entry into a case with a larger group.<br\/><br\/>Recently, outside Leinster House, the wives of serving soldiers protested at the pay and conditions of their partners.  Not wishing to enter that debate and the merits of their protest, it is fairly obvious these women did not stand in the manner they did because they had nothing better to do.  Rather, like many others in our society, they have been put to the pin of their collar to make ends meet.  I mention this group because my firm advises more than 300 ex-soldiers who took and were affected by the anti-malarial drug Lariam.  The merits of the case are not for this room but, respectfully, the mathematics are.  To ask the wife of a soldier to provide &euro;235 for membership only of a case which has a long journey with both the causation of the case and the personal effects on each individual soldier to be proved is something which ranks well above the day-to-day priorities of this particular cohort.<br\/><br\/>From a defendant's point of view, the absence of the &euro;235 per case means that this cost is avoided at the end of the case, should it be successful.  One does not have to issue proceedings to be part of a multi-party action under this Bill.  Instead, one creates the register outside of the court and then joins it.  For example, in the case of Lariam, the defendant, being the Department of Defence and the State, will know whether somebody was a member of the Defence Forces and whether they were given the drug.  Accordingly, the membership, or otherwise, should not necessarily involve these costs incurred.<br\/><br\/>The Injuries Board will not deal with these cases because it cannot do so.  The &euro;45 charge is spent finding out something we already know, a point which we have been told in our discussions with the Injuries Board.  This is a typical example of how this goes.<br\/><br\/>If there were 500 people in this cohort, the total saving is &euro;117,500.  To my mind, that is a significant saving.  The size of this figure in the overall cost of the case may appear small to a defendant.  However, that highlights the inequality between plaintiff and defendant.  To find &euro;235 can be a lot harder than finding &euro;117,500.<br\/><br\/>The requirements to fund a case do not stop at the entry point.  The cost merely allows for entry.  The management and the proving of the case, as well as its execution to its conclusion, can be massive.  A typical expert witness in a banking case will cost &euro;50,000 to brief, report, respond to discovery and attend a trial.  There may be many expert witnesses.  Who will pay them?  Will it be the clients, private funders or the solicitors themselves?  No expert, be it in a medical negligence or financial matter, will work for nothing.  Somebody has to pay him.<br\/><br\/>We already have shown that not everybody can meet &euro;235.  If one has 500 people to run a case, brief counsel, hire people to deal with massive discovery - sometimes one has to hire up to 20 barristers to deal with discovery - one can be faced with a bill of up to &euro;1 million.  One can say it is fine with &euro;2,000 per man.  However, that &euro;2,000 is a bridge too far for so many people.<br\/><br\/>This legislation has to be able to the deal with a hybrid of all types of funding, be it that people can opt to fund themselves, partake of finance if it should be beyond them, or the solicitor can deal with the costs.  Few solicitors would be in a position to carry these costs but it can be done.  The adage of n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile comes to mind.  It is possible for everybody to come together to do this.  However, it is not always the case.  What does a lead solicitor do when he knows some of his 500 people have not paid because they simply cannot?  Does he tell them they cannot come in?  Does he carry the cost himself?  Does he not tell the others?  These are the practicalities of dealing with these cases.<br\/><br\/>I have never had a multi-party case - I have run more than 20 of them - where everybody paid up.  They did not because they could not.  We just had to suck it up.  That is no way to deal properly with people's right of access to justice, particularly in this day and age.  Normally, it is the poorest who are most affected by these cases, not the richest.  Those are the people who need to be minded most, in my respectful view.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 covers the day-to-day issues concerning the size of the particular cohort.  The Bill states it should be an application to the High Court to expand the register.  In my respectful submission, there is no need to do that.  One can create the register first and then let the solicitors deal between themselves.  I am doing a case in France where there are 11,000 people in the cohort.  All discussions are not in the courts but between the plaintiff and defendant lawyers, spending hours poring over the list, deciding who is in and who is out.  That is the proper way to do it.  To have these differences aired in court, when it is quite clear to both parties as trained lawyers that somebody is in or out, is a waste of the court's time.  It will certainly clog up the system, a system designed to simplify the process and to make it less expensive.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 deals with the publication of the existence of the register.  During the establishment of the Residential Institutions Redress Board, ads were taken out by the State all over the world for the whole diaspora to see this was happening in the home country.  People who had often left for the very same reason the redress board was established had to be contacted and identified.  It is to be hoped we will never have the dark time of such a redress system again.  I mean that because I was actually involved in the negotiation of the Act itself.  There should be a provision in this legislation to allow for the inclusion of the existence of the register in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>.  In turn, this will notify it to people and it can be picked up by the media and so publicised.  Otherwise, the cost falls once again on the plaintiffs to do so because the defendants will not do this.<br\/><br\/>The adverse costs order is one of the main parts of the Bill which I feel needs to be thought through carefully.  There will only be one shot at this and it is incumbent on everybody to understand who the legislation affects.  We can start with the most vulnerable in society, wards of court.  For example, if a person is responsible for a ward of court and believes those rights have to be vindicated through some loss which has affected this person, he or she has to consider carefully the effect of an adverse costs order against that ward.<\/p><p>If provision has been made, perhaps in a familial setting, to provide for that person, the money that is set aside for the person is at risk if the person is part of a case.  That is a huge barrier to entry for anybody who is prudent in their advice to a plaintiff on the basis that an adverse costs order is joint and several in fairness to all.  One can also include vulnerable people from a socio-economic perspective in our society.  One can show that the people who are most affected are the people who have the liability of the people who cannot pay foisted onto those who can pay.<\/p><p> I have a clear example of those who can pay.  Since 2010 many families have struggled in middle class Ireland to get back to a place where there is some element of security in their personal lives.  I was approached by a group of 200 people who claim, in my view rightly, that they suffered at the hands of a particular financial institution in a bespoke matter.  There was a finite number and the issue was quite clear.  I had previously taken a case against another financial institution on the same grounds and won it.  This time, however, because it was after 2010 and people had been sharpened by the losses most people suffered in the downturn, they could not find a lead plaintiff among themselves and they would not put themselves forward as party if their improved lot, based on the sacrifices they made in those years, was once again put at risk for a court case.  They could not go forward, so they had to go back.  In reality they were denied their access.  We have great theoretical access to justice here, but the reality of it is completely different.  These cases must be funded and people will lose twice if there is an adverse costs judgment - what they put in and what they will have to pay up.  On the other side, the defendants might say that is fair, given that they have incurred those expenses in vindicating themselves.  However, to take it against one party when the benefit of the case runs to their defence of many cases is incorrect.  In my view this Bill should not allow the targeting of rich or richer people with the expense of those who cannot afford to pay their way but yet have the equal right of access to the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018022100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave Coleman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":678,"content":"<p>We will have to bring it to the concluding points.

I very much enjoyed their presentations.  We had an opportunity to debate this in the D&aacute;il on Second Stage and on that occasion Fianna F&aacute;il indicated it would support the Bill.  It is worthwhile legislation.  From my point of view and knowledge of the courts, it is refreshing to have a discussion about facilitating access to the courts.  On many occasions when we discuss legislation it is about restricting access through reducing limitation periods or restricting people's access to the courts by sending them to some statutory body.  It is important that people recognise that access to the courts is a good thing.  People must be facilitated in gaining access to the courts.  There is a big problem in this country in terms of certain people feeling excluded from the system because of its expense.  We must take steps to ensure that this does not happen.<\/p> <p>  The core advantage of this legislation, and I will be interested to hear Mr. Coleman's comments on this, is that multi-party actions will have the effect of reducing costs in the long run, not just the legal costs of the plaintiff but also the legal costs of the defendant being sued.  Consider, for example, some of the major actions where the State has been wrong, whether it was the infection of women with contaminated blood products or the Army deafness cases.  The State spent a fortune defending those claims.  Does Mr. Coleman think that the cost to the State even of the legal fees would have been reduced had there been a multi-party action scenario for those situations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018022100002#N00500","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":682,"content":"<p>There are two parts to it.  Let us remove the word \"State\" and replace it with \"defendant\".  In my experience, the multi-party action in the limited form we have it at present is one where one signs up the plaintiffs, they will sign up to the agreed questions between the plaintiffs and the defendants that are given to the court, and in so answering that binds the group.  That is far more efficient than having 300 or 500 individual statements of claim and having to go through all the procedures before the court for each one, which creates a massive amount of work and effort to no avail because everybody in the room will know that the points to be decided are being decided in the main cases and that all other cases should be, in effect, stood up.  I agree that considerable savings can be made by having this system.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the State, and I hope I am not overstepping the mark, sometimes there is not much commerciality in dealing with these problems.  In a typical medical negligence case the apology is given at the very end.

It is very much part of a bigger picture.

It is not only about access to the courts, particularly where the State is responsible as the defendant.  There has to be a change in culture.  This circling of the wagons most definitely exists.  Not only does this put pressure on people but there are tremendous amounts of money involved.  Looking at the detail on Army deafness, nearly &euro;300 million was paid out.  Some &euro;100 million of that went on legal costs, not to mind what people were put through.  The Lariam example is teed up for that.  The present situation suggests we will have tortuous one-by-one litigation - it has already started - which does not do anybody any good.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Ms Barry's point.  This is a modest Bill.  It will leave many matters unaddressed.  However, it is an important opportunity to discuss some of the bigger issues and it is better than what is there.  From that point of view, even from the point of view of efficient court management, it is probably better.<\/p> <p>  I do not have a large number of questions.  The biggest gap in the Bill is the issue of champetry and the lack of provision in it for third party funding.  I would like to know the panel's opinion on that.  The prohibition in Ireland is out of kilter with nearly everywhere else in the world.  The Supreme Court upheld it in May 2017.  Ms Justice Denham stated it should be perhaps looked at as a separate law.  This is where a person not related cannot fund a case.  It has come up on many occasions with persons with whom we have been dealing.  I refer to groups of people, some of whom are involved.  Those who are not might be family members.  They might want to use GoFundMe online where many people throw in &euro;20 because they see an injustice and they want to help, but they cannot do that.  The Government has stated this has to be done in separate legislation and one cannot include it in this.  If we do not address that, we will not advance these issues.

In practice, however, there is no civil legal aid to represent defendant borrowers in those cases.  The Abhaile scheme is a start in terms of people getting legal advice and vouchers to access the advice of personal insolvency practitioners.  There has been a lot of talk about strategic default and people not responding to proceedings or engaging and so on but the simple fact of the matter is that most people go unrepresented or are expected to turn up in a county registrar's court on their own to fight their corner.  Ten years after the bust that, in and of itself, is a ridiculous situation.  That is a broader point.<\/p> <p>  On the point made earlier, there is a tendency to say that we do not want to lawyer up the system but sometimes that leads to people's basic right of access to the courts being infringed in some way.

In other words, if one were to succeed, X number of people with that institution would not be excluded or removed from their homes.  It therefore does have a value other than the monetary compensation.  We did not speak to that here today but it is true that more than just monetary compensation can be achieved by stopping something.  I know there is a precedent value in the common law system as it currently stands which has a limited effect also.

A total of 112 people were in the cohort.  An offer of settlement was reached.  As a result of that, each person had to sign up to it.  Of course, some people were recalcitrant and reluctant.  However, we agreed with the other side that there would be a 95% uptake and that would allow for it to be put before the court.  One can imagine when one must negotiate 95% of one's cohort.  Similarly, in all the other cases, in order to settle a case because one is not settling for full value, one is settling to de-risk a case because one will not always win 100%, one must take into account the risks the case faces before the law as it is.  We have agreed these \"as you go\" ways.  I do not think it is really acceptable to have that type of system in place if one is going to legislate for multi-party actions.  There must be a more structured method of dealing with this even if one must enshrine it in legislation that once certain criteria are followed, the case is deemed to be settled.  We could speak to that probably on the basis of other types of issues.  For example, if 95% of the plaintiffs for whom I act want to settle, what happens to the other 5%?  Do I act for them and continue?  Clearly, I cannot do so if I have recommended a settlement.  They are almost in effect cast out other than for the settlement that has been foisted upon them.  It does create quite an issue and a tension with people who will, ultimately, blame their lawyer when, in fact, one is trying to look for the common good and is doing perhaps what a judge would rule if appointed to do so - not the judge hearing the case or creating the register but an application to another judge to hear the pros and cons of the settlement and not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018022100002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave Coleman"},{"type":"speech","time":1519203600,"counter":752,"content":"<p>Do either Ms Barry or Mr. Joyce wish to add anything?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018022100002#R00700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519203600,"counter":753,"content":"<p>The Law Reform Commission's report seemed to distinguish between a case where an individual might wish to settle and the group settlement.

I am very honoured by the proposal to extend my appointment as chairperson of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, for a further year and to have this opportunity to present my credentials to the committee this morning.  I grew up and attended primary school in Saudi Arabia.  I returned to Ireland for my secondary education and boarded at Rathdown School, Glenageary, County Dublin and subsequently at King&rsquo;s Hospital School, Palmerstown.  I graduated with a bachelor's degree in business and legal studies from UCD in 1996.  I completed a certificate in marketing and French and moved to the United Kingdom where I was employed by the British Potato Council in Oxford as an export marketing executive and subsequently as export manager.  The British Potato Council is a semi-State body funded through levies from the potato industry.  My main responsibility in those two roles was the management of external international consultants who assisted in the management of the public image of British seed and consumer potatoes through media management, trade shows, seed growth trials and Government relationships.  Our target markets were mainly in Europe and the Middle East.  I represented the British Potato Council on a number of committees, including the Department for the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs export industry committee which facilitated the exchange of ideas and co-ordination of international activities for a diverse range of British food and cultural promotional bodies.  I completed my employment in the British Potato Council in a consumer-marketing role promoting the industry to consumers in association with retailers and potato processors.  In all of these roles I had budgetary responsibility, ensuring that limited resources were applied to gain the maximum or greatest result.<\/p> <p>  I moved back to Ireland and in 2005 I graduated from the Honorable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns with merit and was called to the Bar.  I completed my practical training as a barrister while devilling in 2005 and 2006, first with Ms Caroline Cummings in criminal law and judicial review and then with Ms Marian Moylan and Ms Carrie Jane Canniffe in both family law and commercial law.  I currently practice at the Bar and have a civil law practice based in Dublin.  One of the cornerstones of the Irish Bar is the fact that barristers are independent, notwithstanding who they represent or have represented in the past.  Over the past 12 years, my practice has included judicial review proceedings where I have advised members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na challenging the procedures in disciplinary investigations.  I have also provided legal advice to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office on challenges by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to decisions regarding disciplinary matters and the Garda compensation scheme.  I regularly advise on contractual and negligence disputes and have represented injured persons and insurance companies in a range of personal injuries actions, including physical and psychological injuries.  I have also advised clients on bullying and harassment claims and employment contract disputes.  I have also managed a team of barristers in a large electronic discovery process for a commercial funds dispute.  I was a member of the family Bar working group tasked with exploring the role of alternative dispute resolution in family disputes in December 2007.  This included assisting in the drafting of a response to the report of Dr. Carol Coulter on the family law courts.  <\/p> <p>  In 2008 I was appointed by the arbitration committee of the Bar Council to two working groups to assist in the preparations for the International Council for Commercial Arbitration , ICCA, conference and the young arbitration practitioners conference.  The working groups were established to market and promote the involvement of practitioners in the conferences and to promote alternative dispute resolution in Ireland.  Following an interview process I was selected by the arbitration committee to intern at the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, ICDR, in New York.<\/p> <p>  During my time at the Bar, I have taught law to a range of students who have varying levels of, and requirements for, legal knowledge.  I currently tutor on the legal studies diploma course and the barrister-at-law degree course, which is a vocational course concentrating on practice and procedure.  Both courses are provided in the Honorable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns.  I have also developed and delivered a basic introduction to law course for final year engineering students in UCD<\/p> <p>  My experience, while diverse, shows some of the key skills that are required in the role of chairperson of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, particularly objectivity, independence and a focus on fair procedures.  As the committee knows, the MCIB was set up pursuant to the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000 and SI 276 of 2011, the European Communities (Merchant Shipping) (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations 2011.  Its function is to carry out investigations of marine casualties involving Irish vessels or that take place in Irish waters.  The result of those investigations is to ascertain the cause of the incident in order to enable the MCIB to make recommendations to the Minister, particularly safety recommendations.  While the reports can, at times, make for difficult reading, the recommendations aim to assist in preventing the repetition of those incidents.  The paramount focus of the MCIB is to assist in the promotion of a culture of safety in the water and on vessels.  The assignment of blame or fault does not fall under the remit of the MCIB and it is important that this essential feature continues to be promoted.  It is necessary for the efficient management of investigations that people interviewed in the course of it understand that the purpose is purely to ascertain the cause of the incident and not to assign blame or fault.  This promotes openness, which could otherwise be a difficulty.  It is important to keep in mind that with some incidents a whole village or community will have been touched by that incident.  In that context, it is very important that we are seen as promoters of a safety culture.  <\/p> <p>  A further key statutory provision is the independent nature of the MCIB, which enables it to address appropriate safety recommendations to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport where appropriate and if required.  Independence in respect of a relationship with the industry is also important.  I have no connection with the marine industry and in the five years that I have been chairperson of the board, I have never been conflicted in a situation or unable to deal with a particular report..<\/p> <p>  I was appointed to the role of chairperson of the MCIB in January 2013 for a period of five years.  In that time I have had the pleasure of working with dedicated members of the secretariat who underpin the work of the board and without whom we could not function.  They are our only full-time employees.  At the moment our secretary to the board is Ms Margaret Bell and she is supported by Ms Monica Quinn and Mr. Patrick Leonard.  I have also had the pleasure of working with very committed members of the board.  When I was originally appointed the board comprised two independent members, Mr. Brian Keane and Mr. Miche&aacute;l Frain, as well as Mr. Brian Hogan, who is the chief surveyor and Mr. Jurgen Whyte, the nominee of the Secretary General of the Department..  In 2016 and 2017 the two independent members completed their terms and we welcomed two new members on to the board, Ms Dorothea Dowling and Mr. Frank Cronin.<\/p><p>Towards the end of 2017, Nigel Lindsay replaced Jurgen Whyte, after 12 years, as the nominee of the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p> During my time as chairman of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, we have made several changes to protect confidentiality, for example, through the anonymising of published reports, and to ensure the focus is on the safety recommendations.  We underwent an audit by the European Maritime Safety Agency to assess the implementation of EU Directive 2009\/18\/EC, implemented in Ireland as SI No. 276 of 2011.  We are undergoing preparations for the implementation of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  Obviously, we hold much data in respect of families and others involved in marine incidents.  It is important our systems and processes protect personal information held in the MCIB as a structure.<\/p><p> The MCIB has a panel of investigators and knowledgeable board members.  I see my continuing role as providing independent leadership and guidance to ensure fair procedures are followed in the course of investigations.  The prompt and accurate publication of reports is essential to the work of the MCIB.  It will remain a key focus of the agency's work into the future.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for their time and patience this morning.  I look forward to continuing to ensure the MCIB is run in an efficient manner and the paramount requirement of safety in all waters in Ireland is promoted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Cliona Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519205400,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I am honoured to have been nominated for a second term as chairperson of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.

I joined the ESB from college.  I worked for five years as an engineer and received training in Switzerland and the UK.  I was then promoted to run the section which performed economic analysis and efficiency studies in power stations.  In 1987, I moved to KBC Bank NV's Irish subsidiary.  I worked initially in corporate banking and international aircraft finance.  In the early 1990s I was appointed as head of KBC's project finance operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  The team had 30 project financiers split between Dublin and Brussels and was responsible for several billion euro worth of project lending for infrastructure, energy and telecommunications.  I worked on a large number of European road, tunnel and bridge projects.  I was also involved in rail projects in the UK, Australia and the Benelux countries.  The funding of these projects involved a myriad of financing structures, including public private partnerships, PPPs.<br\/><br\/>In 2000, I returned to ESB International as investment director and worked on major projects in Northern Ireland, Spain and Poland, where ESB was the investor.  I am fortunate to have worked for a major semi-State, which has a disciplined and highly sophisticated approach to developing major infrastructure projects both in Ireland and abroad.  In 2003, I moved to Goodbody Corporate Finance.  Since then, I have advised many semi-State and private companies on mergers and acquisition in energy, infrastructure and health care, as well strategy and fundraising.<br\/><br\/>When I was appointed as chairperson of the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, in 2013, the most difficult challenge the organisations faced was the merger of the two entities to become TII.  TII is now a single organisation in a single location with good cross-fertilisation of ideas between people with diverse engineering backgrounds.  During the merger and afterwards, Luas cross city, Gort to Tuam, the N11 extension, Newlands Cross and other major and minor projects were completed.  The staff of TII are to be commended on keeping their focus on delivering all these projects, while bedding in a new organisation.<br\/><br\/>At the time the merger was first mooted, the estimated savings were &euro;3 million per annum.  The actual outturn was approximately &euro;10 million per annum.  The largest savings have been in personnel numbers and premises.  In terms of personnel, the savings have probably gone too far, particularly in terms of being able to undertake long-term planning.  This is a matter on which we are engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<br\/><br\/>TII's mission is to provide high quality transport infrastructure and services, delivering a better quality of life and supporting economic growth.  It is responsible for the Luas in Dublin, as well as 5,306 km of national roads.  The Luas carries over 100,000 passengers per day, almost a third of the number of passengers carried by Dublin Bus.  The national road network transports people, goods and services between the country's major cities, towns, airports and ports.  It is fair to say that TII's activities impact on almost every citizen in the State.<br\/><br\/>The board of TII oversees an authority which directly employs approximately 260 people.  TII also funds 11 national roads offices, NROs, with 200 local authority technical staff.  The NROs' management of projects and local knowledge are invaluable.  Larger PPP projects are managed directly by TII.<br\/><br\/>Since 2000, TII has moved from a developer of roads and light rail to become a major operations manager.  Most operations are outsourced.  In total, 1,250 km of high-speed motorways, motorway service areas and tunnels are operated by a combination of PPP concessionaires and specialist operators.  TII manages all PPP procurement directly and outsources commercial operations such as the M50 eFlow, Dublin Port tunnel and Luas services.  Overall, some 2,000 people are employed on the operations side, with over 1,000 employed on the construction of major road and rail projects last year.  I have included a diagram with this presentation, which I hope gives an appreciation of the scale of TII's activities.<br\/><br\/>Safety is a key concern for all who work for TII.  The board is acutely aware that building, operating and maintaining roads and light rail are inherently dangerous activities.  Monitoring safety on sites and on roads and light rail operations is a key part of what we do.<br\/><br\/>Last year had the lowest number of road deaths since records began.  While this is welcome, we must strive to do better.  TII monitors accidents on the national road network using road traffic collision data collected by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and validated by the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  We try to prioritise improvements in areas where collisions are most prevalent.  Further information is provided in the appendix to the written statement on our progress with safety schemes.<br\/><br\/>Luas safety is a key issue and a combination of education campaigns and red-light infringement cameras have improved our safety statistics.  Luas safety statistics compare well internationally, but again we must do even better.<br\/><br\/>Congestion is clearly a growing problem.  While I know that it is no comfort to those stuck in traffic jams or feeling squashed on the Luas, it is worth pointing out that congestion is a symptom of economic success.  However, I believe that as a country we have consistently underestimated growth and have failed to plan for success.  In the 20 years since the 1996 census, the population in Ireland rose by 1.1 million people.  The national planning framework expects an additional 1 million people by 2040, essentially in 22 years.  A recent ESRI report, however, indicated the population could increase by up to 1.1 million people by 2030, ten years before the national planning framework.  TII is a looking again at the national transport model to see if we need to update it for these latest projections.<br\/><br\/>TII has conducted a detailed analysis of the chronic underspend on road maintenance.  The results are stark.  The annual spend on asset renewal of the national primary routes has been well short of the required investment level of &euro;140 million per annum.<\/p><p>Continued under-investment in pavement renewals for a period of 20 years will result in extensive repairs costing over &euro;600 million per annum.  This is more than twice as expensive in real terms and in no way represents value for money.   I am grateful for the commitment from the Department that this funding gap will be phased out by 2020. <\/p><p> In 2016, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council noted that depreciation on public infrastructure was approximately 2.1% - the same level as spending.  A benign interpretation is that Ireland is standing still.  In 2017, the World Economic Forum ranked Ireland as 38th in the world for infrastructure.  Our National Competitiveness Council's analysis the same year stated that Ireland was spending less than the EU average on infrastructure.  This means that as a country, we are going backwards compared with peer countries.  When we consider the rapid growth in population, which is not the case in many European countries, Ireland is going backwards quite quickly compared with our peers.  In its 2014 report on advanced economies, the IMF showed that spending an extra 1% of GDP on infrastructure leads to an immediate 0.4% increase in GDP with a permanent increase in GDP of 1.5% four years later.  This information is not new.  These results are almost identical to those produced by Professor John FitzGerald in the ESRI's medium-term review back in 2003.  The ten-year national development plan published last Friday is very welcome and TII looks forward to playing its part in building out those projects we are tasked with.  <\/p><p> A word of caution regarding the delivery of future infrastructure is probably appropriate.  The board of TII is very concerned at the small number of major schemes that it has ready to go for planning or construction.  Funding has not been provided during the recession to develop such schemes.  The committee will be aware that a typical timeline for a major project is eight to 13 years from start to finish - assuming that there are no legal or planning challenges.  Unfortunately, these challenges happen all too often in Ireland.  TII is in the business of long-term planning and I welcome the indications that TII will be allocated funding to put more projects through planning.  The cost of planning permission is a small fraction of the cost of the project but it provides optionality value.  Once planning permission is in place for a significant number of projects, they can be scheduled as and when money becomes available.  Without planning in place, we and others may not be in a position to take up available funding.  TII is actually delighted that this issue has been addressed comprehensively in the national development plan.  <\/p><p> Whether a person needs to travel from Sandyford to the Dublin Institute of Technology at Grangegorman or between Limerick and Galway, our job in TII is to provide a safe and efficient user experience.  We invest money on behalf of the taxpayer to enable access to jobs and for goods and services in the most efficient manner possible right throughout the country.  I acknowledge and pay tribute to the leadership of Michael Nolan, CEO of TII, and his very strong management team.  Theirs is a difficult and demanding job at the best of times and they do their job with commitment, dedication and good grace.  On behalf of my fellow board members and TII, I can assure the committee that we will continue to work closely with the Oireachtas, the Department, the National Transport Authority and our local authority partners in meeting the transportation infrastructure needs of Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I call on Mr. John Mullins, chairman designate of the Port of Cork, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#E00200","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519205400,"counter":788,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; an-s&aacute;sta a bheith anseo maidin inniu chun cuntas Phort Chorca&iacute; a thabhairt don choiste.

I would like members to go through the document because it is in presentation format.  I would like to present my credentials and vision for the Port of Cork at this session this morning.  I stand before the committee seeking re-appointment to the position of chairman of the Port of Cork Company for a period of three years from 1 March.  I will firstly introduce myself to the committee and then present the salient challenges and opportunities facing my intended stewardship of the board of the Port of Cork.<br\/><br\/>I was born in Cork nearly 50 years ago in 1968 in the south inner city to Patrick and Maureen Mullins.  My father spent his life as a painter-decorator for Cork City Council and my mother was well occupied with five boys of which I am the eldest.  I was educated in North Monastery primary and secondary schools and then went on to study electrical engineering in University College Cork.  I completed a bachelor's degree in 1989 and was awarded graduate of the year in UCC in 1989.  I also studied a master's degree in electrical engineering.  In 1997, I graduated from the Smurfit Business School in UCD with a first-class honours MBA.<br\/><br\/>I started my career with ESB - Mr. O'Rourke is a former colleague of mine - and am very thankful for the very fine career foundation I received there.  I worked as a senior consultant in PwC in London specialising in the communications, energy, water and transport division.  In 2000, I returned to Ireland to work with ESB International where I worked with Mr. O'Rourke on projects in Poland and project managed and commercially negotiated ESB's largest external investment in Amorebieta in the Basque region of Spain.  In 2002, I joined NTR and worked with all of the companies in the group - Toll Roads, Greenstar, Celtic Anglian Water, Bioverda and Airtricity.  I left NTR in 2007 to take up the position of chief executive officer in Bord G&aacute;is Eireann.<br\/><br\/>My time in Bord G&aacute;is Eireann was immensely enjoyable and challenging.  My period was marked by significant diversification of the company, in particular into electricity with the Big Switch.  The company has since split in three and significant parts were privatised and now trade as Centrica's Bord G&aacute;is Energy and Brookfield Renewable Energy, which I am proud to say is now based in Cork and is the head of Brookfield's pension fund out of Cork for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.<br\/><br\/>Along with partners, I founded Amarenco Solar in 2013 and since then, we have grown the company to over 50 employees in Ireland, the UK and France.  With partners, Amarenco has invested over &euro;300 million in solar technology in France.  I hope to invest well over &euro;100 million in Ireland, primarily in the Cork region, by 2020.  I am a fellow of Engineers Ireland and the Academy of Engineers of Ireland and hold board positions with Heneghan PR, Mainline Group and Wisetek.  I am involved in the Cork Foundation, Anam Cara and Co-operation Ireland charities in the Cork region.  I am a former president of the Cork Chamber of Commerce and received the title of <i>Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur<\/i>in 2016 from the French President for services to French renewables.<br\/><br\/>I will deal with trade in the first instance.  The Port of Cork has achieved throughput growth from 2013 to 2017 of over 10%.  This is charted at the top of page 2 of the presentation.  Regrettably, Lisheen Mine closed in 2015 leading to a 350,000-tonne reduction in throughput per annum which came through Tivoli in addition to a decline in Bantry tonnage in 2016.  That was due to oil strategies in Zenith, which it took over from Phillips 66 in 2015.  The total traffic volume is 10 million tonnes.  We should be aware that the Port of Cork is responsible for about 20% of all the trade through ports in Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>We have achieved significant growth with regard to financial performance over the five years.  Turnover is now close to &euro;30 million, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation is about &euro;9.5 billion and operating surplus and dividends paid to the Minister total <i>circa<\/i>&euro;3 million.  In fact, the dividends have increased by a factor of 60% in that period annually.  Our operating surplus has moved from &euro;1.7 million in 2013 to &euro;5.7 million in 2017.  The closure of Lisheen Mine resulted in a loss of about &euro;1 million worth of annual revenue in 2016 and 2017.  These five-year trends are graphed in figure 1 on page 3.  <br\/><br\/>The port has achieved significant growth in container traffic in particular primarily because of the upturn in the economy.  In particular, there is a lot of industry in the Cork region that exports but we also have quite an amount of importation for domestic consumption as well.  Measured in 20 ft. equivalent units, TEUs, we have an increase of about 28% in the period from 2013 to 2017 in TEU trade.  In addition, the container-handling facilities at the Ringaskiddy deepwater terminal were also improved to enable the Port of Cork and the global shipping company Maersk enable a direct deep-sea transatlantic service to Ireland from South America and Cuba every Saturday to deliver practically all Fyffes bananas and pineapples for this country.  It used to go through Rotterdam and then come by short-sea service to here so it now comes directly to Ringaskiddy in the only Panamax size container ship that arrives in Ireland at any time.  <br\/><br\/>The Port of Cork has achieved significant growth in the number of cruise line calls in Cork.  When we started in 2013, there were 61 calls.  This year, we will have 96.  This is replicated right across the country in all harbours and ports.  Progress has also been made with cruise line calls to Bantry.  I am proud to say that we will have eight calls in Bantry in 2018 - a mixture of Glengarriff and Bantry port.<\/p><p>We have had significant capital additions, including the Ringaskiddy development advanced works, costing &euro;9.7 million.  Regarding Bantry inner harbour development, we completed a brand-new marina and leisure area and we upgraded the pier for all the fishing, aquaculture and leisure activities and for the operation of the ferry to Whiddy.  This cost approximately &euro;9 million.  The development was launched in August 2017 in west Cork.  We put a new Liebherr LMH 550 crane in Ringaskiddy in 2014, costing about &euro;3.6 million.  We implemented a new automatic truck gate system, primarily because of congestion in the Tivoli area.  That is a critical issue.  Considering that container traffic has grown by 28%, there is significant truck movement on the Tivoli and the lower road.  That is one the main reasons we are moving down to Ringaskiddy with the container terminal.  The Cobh cruise terminal has been upgraded.  We are now able to take the largest cruise liners in the world because of the natural water depth in Cobh.  The largest cruise ships, which have about 6,500 passengers, are expected to come to Cobh in the coming years.  Surfacing works at the existing container terminal at Tivoli had to completed.  We have purchased cargo handling equipment. <br\/><br\/>The limitations of the facilities in Tivoli, which facilities have served Cork well, concern water depth, the width for vessel swinging, and landside terminal capacity.  These limitations require the relocation of the container business downstream to the lower harbour at Ringaskiddy, where the depth of water is approximately 13 m, as opposed to approximately 6 m at Tivoli.  Maritime traders want to enter and exit the harbour as quickly as possible.  This will reduce the carbon footprint in the context of cruising up the harbour into the river.  All the goods will be dispatched at Ringaskiddy and thus there will be no cruising through Passage West and past Blackrock into Tivoli.  The port redevelopment will be beneficial to the port, port customers, the city, the wider Cork community and the region.<br\/><br\/>Full planning permission for critical-infrastructure port redevelopment at Ringaskiddy was granted in May 2015 by An Bord Plean&aacute;la following an efficient strategic-infrastructure oral hearing in September 2014.  Revised phase-1 amended planning permission was granted on 8 June 2017.  The company has therefore achieved planning permission for phase 1 of the Ringaskiddy development, which includes an optimised 360 m single berth, a straddle carrier operating system, and a new maintenance building for straddle carriers.  Phase 1 will see the port relocate its container business from the current city centre Tivoli location to a new facility at Ringaskiddy.  Figure 2 of my submission illustrates the difficulty associated with turning a ship in the River Lee.  Dredging to keep the River Lee going costs around &euro;500,000 per year.  That is a significant cost to the port of Cork.<i><\/i>The Ringaskiddy phase 1 development will be operational by 2020 and will include an optimised 360 m single berth, a straddle carrier operating system and some new maintenance buildings.<br\/><br\/><i><\/i>At a European level, the port of Cork is included within the new TEN-T regulation as a &quot;core&quot; port on the North Sea-Mediterranean corridor, along with being identified as a tier-1 port in the 2013 national ports policy.  In line with this TEN-T designation, the port has secured funding under the TEN-T and the Connecting Europe Facility grant aid schemes for its Ringaskiddy developments. <br\/><br\/><i><\/i>PoCC was successful in 2013 with its funding application made under the acceleration or facilitation for the implementation of TEN-T projects.  Grant aid of 50%, amounting to &euro;1.8 million, was made available to obtain statutory consents for the Ringaskiddy development, complete financial and economic appraisals, detailed designs and communication plans, and prepare tender documentation.<br\/><br\/><i><\/i>PoCC submitted an application for TEN-T transport section CEF funding to the European Commission's Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport during 2015 following Department of Transport ,Tourism and Sport endorsement.  The European Commission notified PoCC on 29 June 2015 that it had decided to allocate &euro;12.74 million &ndash; or 17.5% of the eligible expenditure - to fund the construction of the proposed Ringaskiddy development. <br\/><br\/><i><\/i>Unfortunately, the February 2016 application made under the Motorways of the Sea scheme, in partnership with Dublin Ferryport Terminals and Belfast Harbour authorities to try to secure EU funding assistance for ship-to-shore cranes, straddle carriers and the gate operating system was unsuccessful.  Re-engagement with Europe on BREXIT restructuring should be a policy priority so such applications will be positively viewed in the future.<br\/><br\/><i><\/i>In 2017 the company agreed a funding structure for the Ringaskiddy port redevelopment with the European Investment Bank, worth &euro;30 million, with AIB, worth &euro;30 million, and with the Irish Strategic Infrastructure Fund, worth &euro;18 million.  The company received the borrowing consent from the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Public Expenditure and Reform on 14 December 2017 to proceed with the Ringaskiddy development.  Legal documentation was then finalised, on 20 December 2017, in Dublin and the three facility agreements, the common terms agreement and the inter-creditor agreement were signed by all parties on that date.  PoCC was then in a position to issue a letter of acceptance to BAM on 20 December 2017.  We expect the commencement of works soon.  It should be noted that we are engaged in a legal dispute with BAM as a contractor in this regard.<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>The Whitegate oil refinery accounts for over 55% of the port's overall cargo tonnage figures and accounts for 28% of the tonnage and goods income of PoCC.  PoCC was very pleased to learn on 3 August 2016 that an agreement was reached with Irving Oil, a Canadian family-owned business, to purchase and secure the future of the Whitegate oil refinery.  There were threats that it would close but we were very much part of the process of ensuring it would remain open.<br\/><br\/>The company entered into a joint venture with Lanber Holdings to purchase and redevelop Marino Point.  Ownership of the joint venture company is split as follows: 60% Lanber Holdings and 40% PoCC.  The purchase of Marino Point was completed on 2 June 2017.  This site has lain fallow for the best part of 15 years.  I refer to the old IFI site.  There are significant specific projects intended for the site that will free up lands in the docklands of Cork for future infrastructural development.<br\/><br\/>On<i><\/i>Bantry Bay port, the amalgamation and consolidation of the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners' assets with PoCC was completed on 1 January 2014, and a 100% subsidiary, Bantry Bay Port Company DAC, was created to manage the Bantry Bay operation.  Following the unveiling of plans to develop Bantry Harbour in 2015, phase 1 of the Bantry inner harbour development, costing in the region of &euro;9 million, was completed.  The official opening ceremony of the Bantry marina development took place on 11<sup><\/sup>August 2017.  Completion of the Bantry inner harbour blueways kayaking trail was completed in 2016.  This trail is the first of its kind in Munster.<br\/><br\/>PoCC secured planning permission in December 2014 for upgrading the cruise-berthing facilities in Cobh as part of a cruise vision to accommodate the cruise vessels of the maximum size.  This investment of &euro;1.5 million allows us to take in those vessels.<br\/><br\/>In 2017, the company purchased a site on Lynch's Quay in Cobh, as tenant in common with Cork County Council, for the purpose of future development to accommodate tourist and cruise-ship traffic and particularly to provide a new ferry terminal for tourists to visit the Spike Island facility.  It is also to provide incremental opportunities for two cruise liners to arrive at Cobh at the same time.<br\/><br\/>I am chairman of the pension fund in PoCC.  I inherited a deficit in the fund.  In May 2014, we agreed with the Pensions Authority a funding programme to 2023 to make sure the defined-benefit pension fund stays whole, at a rate of at least 100%, for all past and present employees of the port.<br\/><br\/>In August 2017, PoCC welcomed to Cork a delegation from NextDecade Corporation, a liquefied natural gas, LNG, development company based in Houston, USA.  NextDecade and PoCC had previously signed a memorandum of understanding to explore a joint development opportunity for a new floating storage regasification unit, FSRU, and associated LNG import terminal infrastructure in Ireland.  NextDecade focused on one area within the harbour, west of Whitegate jetty, for this development.  As an entry point into the Irish energy market, the port of Cork is an attractive location for an FSRU-based LNG import terminal.  Surrounded by existing marine infrastructure and industrial facilities, the proposed site is less than 2 km from the Gas Networks Ireland grid at the Bord G&aacute;is Energy plant in Whitegate.<br\/><br\/>Let me refer to the International Shipping Services Centre, or Cork city docklands.<i><\/i>PoCC maintains its support for the Cork docklands redevelopment and intends playing a full role in ensuring that the development potential of the area is realised.  PoCC management is in continual discussions with Cork City Council, assisted by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, regarding the future operation of the city quays.  The company is currently chairing a stakeholder group, including developers, the council, IDA and chamber of commerce, in proposing the concept of the international shipping services centre which would be, in the context of Brexit, an opportunity to provide back-office maritime, financial and IT support in the development of significant office blocks within the inner docklands area.<br\/><br\/>Following a detailed review of Ringaskiddy redevelopment funding and office options, the directors of PoCC decided that the Custom House property located at Custom House Quay in the centre of Cork docklands would be advertised on the open market for sale.  One party expressed a keen interest in purchasing the property and the PoCC board of directors agreed to proceed with negotiations.  An agreement for the sale of the Custom House to Tower Development Properties Limited &ndash; Time Square Construction and Development &ndash; was signed on 20 April 2017, subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of planning permission.  Two buildings are listed.  There are heritage clauses within the agreement to ensure the building will be open to the public and that there will be no changes internally or externally to the Custom House.  It is appropriate for the port to have its people close to where it operates.  That is the same in Dublin, Galway, Waterford and elsewhere in the country.  We cannot be 20 km from where we operate.  The reality is that this is an operational issue as much as a financial one for the company.<br\/><br\/><i><\/i>In anticipation of the future redevelopment of the Tivoli site, PoCC commissioned the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland to consider the potential future uses of this estate.  The design review &quot;New Perspective for Tivoli&quot; was completed in early 2017.  PoCC is satisfied that this review has created a series of innovative ideas for a site of 160 acres, demonstrating urban design based on brownfield regeneration projects in benchmark cities, and raised the potential of Tivoli among key stakeholders.<\/p><p>The final draft document was presented to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund in July 2017.  The future redevelopment of the Tivoli estate has the potential to play a key role in the financial security of the Port of Cork Company.  It will also be key in the population 2040 drive in Cork city and will also be a brand new village on the north side of the river.<br\/><br\/>On Tuesday, 16 January 2018, Brittany Ferries announced a new route direct from Ringaskiddy, Cork to Santander in Spain using a new ship, <i>MV Connemara<\/i>.  The service will make two return sailings a week and will be the first ever ferry service directly linking Ireland and Spain.  This announcement came as Brittany Ferries celebrates its 40th year in Ireland.  The popular Cork-Roscoff route opened on St. Patrick's Day in 1978 and has been serving Irish holidaymakers and haulage companies ever since.  It has also brought millions of French passengers to Ireland, boosting the local and national economy.  Discussions with Brittany Ferries this week indicate that the early bookings on that new ferry service are very strong.<br\/><br\/>The Port of Cork Company celebrated the 200th anniversary of Cork Harbour Commissioners in 2013 and published a book on the history of Cork Harbour Commissioners, <i>Portraiture of Cork Harbour Commissioners<\/i>.  The Port of Cork Company and Cunard hosted a commemoration ceremony led by President Michael D. Higgins on 7 May 2015 in Cobh to mark the centenary of the sinking of the <i>RMS Lusitania<\/i>off the Cork coast.  During this five-year period the Port of Cork Company has regarded constant engagement with key customers and stakeholders including the local community as a key priority.  Additionally Port of Cork Company is identifying and planning for the challenges and opportunities associated with Brexit.  Likewise, Port of Cork Company is considering the implications of the full implementation of the European port services directive.<br\/><br\/>The key strategic objectives for the next three years are: complete the Ringaskiddy redevelopment; produce a Marino Point master plan; move port operations from the river to the sea; emphasise efficiency of service to all customers; prepare a master plan for Tivoli; and continue to grow the business for the betterment of the south of Ireland and the State.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have worked with - the former Minister and now Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister, Deputy Ross.

I will start, as requested, by introducing myself and setting out my background as it relates to the role of chairperson of Galway Harbour Company.  I thank the committee for letting me follow Cork.<\/p> <p>  My name is Maurice O&rsquo;Gorman.  I am married to Jacinta, and we have three wonderful children.  I am applying for appointment as chairperson of Galway Harbour Company.  I was first appointed as a director in October 2017.  My career spans both the public sector and the private sector, predominantly in financial services.  I graduated with a BA (Hons) in leadership and management and have obtained additional qualifications in business information and industry professional qualifications.<\/p> <p>  I started my career with the London Stock Exchange in the regulatory division.  I undertook work for the exchange projects in various countries and trained at the SEC in the USA.  My work took me to Saudi Arabia and in 1992 I joined the Central Bank in Riyadh reporting to the deputy governor with responsibility for capital market development.  This work included the establishment of the regulatory framework, the stock exchange, the regulatory authority and large-scale infrastructure projects such as the King Abdullah Financial District, a 32 million sq. ft space in the centre of the city.<\/p> <p>  In 2006 I joined the National Commercial Bank and within the financial group I was a founder, chief operating officer and head of strategy of NCB Capital, which is an investment bank managing approximately &euro;15 billion in assets.  During my time in the Middle East, I was an active member of the Irish Business Association, regularly welcoming Irish businesses and Ministers, and was an active member of the Global Irish Economic Forum.<\/p> <p>  I returned to Ireland full time in 2015 and focused on building our new house, which we are planning to move into within the next few weeks, and voluntary work.  I currently hold the voluntary positions of president of Galway Chamber of Commerce, chairperson of the Galway City Innovation District and a board member of a special fund, NDRC@PorterShed GP Fund 1.  I am also an unpaid non-executive board member of a technology company, called Altocloud.<\/p> <p>  Within the chamber I have been involved in various projects including preparing an economic development plan for Galway and various economic submissions including those on the national planning framework 2040.  I was a founder and now chair the Galway City Innovation District, with the aim of supporting and nurturing start-up companies.<\/p> <p>  In September 2015, we started the renovation of the former Guinness storehouse owned by CI&Eacute; and in April 2016 the PorterShed opened its doors to start-up companies.  Since opening we have held over 300 events and welcomed 6,000 visitors including 23 international delegations.  The PorterShed currently houses 32 companies employing over 100 people.  Additionally over 100 jobs have been created by companies that have graduated from the PorterShed.  In May 2017 in a joint venture with NDRC we launched the first accelerator programme outside of Dublin.  Nine companies have thus far graduated.  Our initial aim is to launch 30 companies over a 24-month period.<\/p> <p>  As part of my voluntary work I have developed strong links with our local authorities, NUIG, GMIT, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the Marine Institute.  <\/p> <p>  Throughout its long history the Port of Galway has developed, thrived and changed, supporting the free movement of people, and the trade in goods and commodities, which is the basis for our prosperity.  As travel and trade have changed over time, and as ships and their cargoes have developed in size, character and technology, so the nature of ports has changed, creating new opportunities for local and regional growth. <\/p> <p>  The need for safe harbours, with built defences interacting with and changing the natural environment, providing unimpeded access, with water deep enough for the largest vessels, still remains.<\/p> <p>  Revenue for the Galway Harbour Company has been trending upwards from a low in 2009.  Pre-audit figures for 2017 show revenue in excess of &euro;4 million and operating profits in excess of &euro;800,000.  Revenue is split fairly evenly between shipping, leasing and parking.  The board and management will continue to focus on growth through improved competitiveness and investment.<\/p> <p>  An immediate priority in accordance with applicable legislation and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies will be the recruitment of a chief executive officer.  Our incumbent CEO will be retiring on 1 March.  Of equal priority is to ensure the smooth transition from State ownership to local authority ownership.  The company has commenced working with the Department and the council management to undertake the due diligence required for an effective share transfer.<\/p> <p>  Good governance is an area in which I have been involved as both a regulator and as a practitioner.  The goal of the board and management is to ensure that resources are directed in accordance with agreed policy, that there is sound decision making and that there is clear accountability for the use of resources in order to achieve desired outcomes. <\/p> <p>  The planning application for the extension of the port is under consideration by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The board of the Galway Harbour Company must ensure that the process is managed appropriately, in terms of cost and time.  The board must ensure that there are plans in place to ensure continued operation of the port, subject to a successful or unsuccessful application.  Assuming planning permission is granted, the Galway Harbour Company will need to prepare a funding model that attracts private-sector investors and lenders in order that the required capital is available and that the port operates profitably on an ongoing basis. <\/p> <p>  Sufficient resources will be required to ensure that contracts for the extension of the port are entered into in line with State procurement requirements, are managed appropriately to ensure value for the State and deliver the expected outcome. <\/p> <p>  As travel and trade have changed over time, and as ships and their cargoes have developed in size, character and technology, so the nature of ports has changed.  This creates new opportunities and challenges the Galway Harbour Company.  <\/p> <p>  I take this opportunity to thank the outgoing chairperson, Mr. Paul Carey, for his dedication and commitment and to Mr. Eamon Bradshaw, the CEO, for the considerable work he has undertaken to develop and grow the Galway Harbour Company.  <\/p> <p>  I am honoured to be designated as chairperson.  I will do my utmost to meet the obligations of the role.  I thank the committee for its time.

Once they are published our reports stand alone.  They can be used in the courts system, by coroners, by families or by companies.  We are very clear that our statutory provision is to focus our investigations not on apportioning blame or fault.  Notwithstanding this, we have a provision that if facts go to some indication that steps were not taken or processes or protocols were not followed that should have been then we must state this.  The anonymising of our reports focuses on the fact that it is not the person involved at the time, it is ascertaining the cause of the incident and attempting to see whether or not any safety recommendations can be made to avoid it happening in the future.  We do not have a role or statutory provision to allow the board to follow up the safety recommendations.  If one looks at some of our previous reports, our safety recommendations tend to focus on matters such as requesting that marine notices be issued, for example to remind people of their obligations in the use of recreational craft and to not take alcohol on board prior to using fishing vessels.  We direct safety recommendations to particular companies that may have been involved in an incident.  We do not name the company but obviously the company is aware that the incident relates to it.  We would recommend, for example, that the company review its navigation systems, its training procedures and its protocols in respect of man overboard procedures for fishing vessels.  Many of these recommendations, even though they are directed, can be taken as general recommendations across the industry.  If the board directs a safety recommendation to large cargo vessels to review their navigation systems and training around navigation systems, we hope that other large shipping fleets will also look at the recommendation, maybe take it on board and review their procedures and see if the report contains any element that may cause them concern.  Many of our safety recommendations are directed towards the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and they include recommendations on issuing of marine notices.  Where we believe that certain statutory provisions should be expanded we also recommend this.  They are quite broad, but we do not have a role in following up on whether the recommendations are done.

Obviously there are a lot of new projects in the pipeline now but Mr. O'Rourke seems to be quite critical of the lack of maintenance put in to the transport infrastructure.  This is at variance with what the Minister might say.  Will Mr. O'Rourke also expand on that?<\/p> <p>  The Port of Cork report is very comprehensive so I will not go in to any great detail.  With regard to Brexit and transport, Mr. O'Rourke referred to TEN-T.  This was designed based on the UK being part of the EU, which looks certain not to happen now.  What effect will this have on the Port of Cork?<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. O'Gorman for his presentation which explains how Galway Port is, obviously, in a different space.  He refers to the pending planning permission and the funding model.  The tier status of the port has been a critical issue, and will be going forward.  Hopefully there will be a positive result from the planning application.  What is Mr. O'Gorman's view on what will happen next?  Will it be more difficult to put the funding model in pace as a result of the tier status of the port?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#H00800","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman for allowing me to come in on this question.

Mr. O'Gorman is bringing a lot of previous experience to the role as president of Galway Chamber and in outlining an economic development plan for Galway.  We are aware that the harbour and its development is key for Galway and the western region.  It is of strategic importance.  For too long the city of Galway has turned its back on the water; our waterways, the canals and the sea.  As my colleague has said, the planning application for the extension of the harbour is under consideration by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

I welcome them all to the committee today.  Three of the four are seeking reappointment.  As part of the reappointment process could they confirm if they have had to apply through the independent Public Appointments Service?<\/p><p>A new process was established a number of years ago through the independent Public Appointments Service.  Did the chairpersons have to apply through that?  Ms Cassidy said she had no experience of the marine when she was appointed in 2013.  Did she feel that affected how she conducted her job and does she feel she has more experience and expertise having served as chairperson of the board for the past five years?  She said one of the key roles of the board is to make safety recommendations in the marine area.  During her time as board chairperson could she indicate how many recommendations she proposed to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and how many of them were adopted?<\/p><p> Ms Cassidy said an audit of the Marine Investigation Board was carried out by the European Maritime Safety Agency during her term as chairperson but she did not share with us the findings of the audit.  Were the findings positive or were issues of concern raised?  If so, could she share them with me?<\/p><p> Mr. O'Rourke is chairperson designate of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII and he too is seeking reappointment.  He referred to the savings made following the merger of the NRA and the RPA, which is welcome.  Increasing savings from &euro;3 million to &euro;10 million is very welcome.<\/p><p> The Luas is a relevant and current issue in the transport sphere.  The Luas cross-city is a fabulous development in the capital's infrastructure involving significant investment of &euro;370 million but it is causing major disruption.  What level of engagement or interaction did TII have with the relevant stakeholders in terms of the proper planning for the roll-out of such key infrastructure in the capital city?<\/p><p> Mr. O'Rourke referred to the national planning framework up to 2040 and how we expect the population to increase by 1 million in the next 24 years.  He also mentioned a recent ESRI report indicating that the population could increase by 1.1 million by 2030, which is much faster.  It may be an unfair question but does he consider we are adequately prepared in the shorter term for such a major population increase in terms of transport infrastructure, be it roads or light rail?<\/p><p> It was also mentioned by Mr. O'Rourke that in a discussion with his CEO he confirmed that due to a lack of funding provided to TII in the past five years it has not been in a position to plan for major structural investments, and because of that he suggests any major timeline will be eight to 13 years.  Based on the ESRI report that the population will increase by 1.1 million by 2030 does he believe the capacity is there to roll out the infrastructural investment that is needed?  Mr. O'Rourke referred to a lack of funding.  I was recently part of a delegation that met with the EU Commission transport office and it informed us of the availability of the Juncker fund.  Why has this country not applied for one cent of funding from that fund for public transport infrastructure?  The lack of infrastructure is hindering our ability to invest.  I think we are the second worst in Europe in terms of the level of investment we put into infrastructure.<\/p><p> Is there any update on the amount of money TII is spending on security in unopened motorway service stations?  The CEO was before a committee in recent weeks and while I did not attend the meeting I heard that in excess of &euro;1 million has already been spent on such security and that there is potential for the situation to continue for another 12 months.<\/p><p> Mr. Mullins gave a very comprehensive overview and outlined some very ambitious plans.  There has been significant development and growth and that must be acknowledged and complimented.  The national development plan refers to moving the Port of Cork.  Could he elaborate a little further in terms of the timeframe and cost?  Could he also speak about the current status of the sale of a building, which I understand is under dispute.  He can correct me if I am wrong.  I am not from Cork but I was contacted by a colleague on the issue.  Is it called the Common Building?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#H01000","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519205400,"counter":804,"content":"<p>It could be the Custom House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Mullins"},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":805,"content":"<p>It was sold last year.<\/p> <p>  I had one other question.

I see from the national development plan that there will be an increase in the reliance by the Government on PPPs for infrastructural projects in the future.  As a manager of such contracts does he consider PPPs to be best practice going forward, given that most countries are moving away from them?  There is sufficient evidence to show that they do not offer value for money.  I would welcome Mr. O'Rourke's opinion on that.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about the criteria for managing conflicts of interest at TII.<\/p><p>Does Mr. O'Rourke consider his current position a conflict of interest with his position as chairperson of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, given that he advises on infrastructure and Government?  According to his curriculum vitae, Mr. O'Rourke advises Departments on procurement options.  If he becomes the manager for the contracts, how would he manage that conflict of interest?  Does he accept that there may be a conflict of interest there?  <\/p><p> The witness also mentioned that savings in personnel have gone too far and may hamper long-term planning in the future.  He has stated that TII is in the business of long-term planning.  Is Mr. O'Rourke saying that TII is short-staffed?  To what extent is it short-staffed?  How will Mr. O'Rourke manage TII's objectives if there are not sufficient staff to plan?  I refer to the funding gap that exists regarding roads maintenance.  Has Mr. O'Rourke met the Minister on this issue and can he expand on that?<\/p><p> I have two other ceisteanna.  Does TII have plans to ensure that new works or remedial works in cities and towns on the national roads feature wheelchair-accessible bus stops?  We have been meeting disability groups of late and this issue has been flagged time and time again.  While there appears to have been some movement on the issue, there does not seem to be any concerted effort or real plan.  Can Mr. O'Rourke outline TII's plan for that in detail?  If he does not have details, perhaps he could furnish the committee with that plan.  I refer also to new motorway service stations.  There is a need for changing rooms in these facilities, particularly for mobility-impaired persons who require a carer to be with them.  Will TII insist that new service stations are fitted with changing rooms?<\/p><p> I also have a question concerning the Galway Harbour Company.

It concerns the Cork-Limerick motorway that was signalled during the week as part of Project Ireland 2040.  Can Mr. O'Rourke tell us whether that motorway will be built through a public private partnership and can he tell us whether it will be tolled?  If he cannot give members a definitive answer, can he give them an indication as to the likely position?<\/p><p>I had a number of questions about facilities and services for people with disabilities but as those questions largely have been asked by Deputy Munster, I will await the replies to them with interest.  <\/p><p>The next question is for the chairpersons designate of the ports and I will start with a quote stating:<\/p><blockquote>This is a smash-and-grab raid, redolent of a bankrupt Government philosophy.  It is one thing to consider selling off the family jewels when, at least, the householder would still have access to the house.  To sell off the ports is akin to the householder selling off the driveway, porch and front door to the house, then having to pay for the right to use them to enter the house in the future.<\/blockquote> <p>The subject matter is clear and concerns the privatisation of the ports.  What is interesting is the identity of the person who made that point.  While one might think it was a member of the national committee of my own party or something like that, it was actually Mr. Maritime himself, Mr. Tom MacSweeney.  The witnesses should give their view to the committee on that particular quotation, which has a lot of substance to it. <\/p><p>My final question is for Mr. Mullins.  It relates to the relocation of the port to Ringaskiddy.  The commencement of the work, the provision of tax clearance certificates, the provision of evidence of insurance and the guarantee that the work is going to get done in time were all matters that came before the court two weeks ago.  I believe they are due to be heard before the commercial court in July.  The witness is aware that there is another controversy in Cork at the moment, surrounding a project for which a bid was placed by BAM.  Initially, &euro;20 million of State investment for that project was discussed.  We are now contemplating a figure of &euro;30 million or arguably &euro;40 million, because apparently the State is being asked to provide so-called infrastructural support to the event centre, apart from another &euro;10 million paid directly.  These are two key projects in Cork for which this company won the tender.  It turns out that for the event centre, an extra &euro;10 million is being asked for, plus &euro;10 million in infrastructure support.  The costs for the ports run to an extra &euro;12 million.  I believe the firm told the commercial court that there was an arithmetic error when the tender was submitted.  <\/p><p>In my opinion this is wholesale profiteering.  Perhaps Mr. Mullins cannot go into the detail with a court case coming up but I am asking him to give us an idea, as the public have a right to know.  What kind of delay this is likely to cause to the relocation? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#K00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":809,"content":"<p>I have some questions for Mr. O'Rourke.  Under the heading of efficiency, he said in his opening statement that congestion is a symptom of economic success.  He qualified that by noting that we have failed to plan for success.  There has not been a gigantic increase in the population of Dublin city centre.  Over three censuses, the increase has only been 13%.  Most of the movements are generated in County Dublin or in the outer counties.  That is under the national spatial strategy.  The national spatial strategy is still in place, and very large amounts of land are being rezoned as we sit here.  We are now moving in another direction with the national planning framework.  One must diagnose the problem correctly.  Land use and transportation planning must be in sync with each other.<\/p> <p>  What input into the national planning framework did Mr. O'Rourke make concerning the transition between those two very different strategies?  Growth has mainly been in the suburbs.  I do not refer to Dublin only as one should consider the growth in Cork, which has mainly been in the suburbs and in Limerick, things are exactly the same.  Galway has bucked the trend, in that it is more consolidated in the centre.  There are, however, major traffic problems in that city which have not been properly planned for and solutions have not been developed in a timely way.  What input did Mr. O'Rourke have into initiatives like the national planning framework?  What transition arrangements did he discuss?<\/p><p>For example, I would have thought the DART underground was a critical component in knitting in what has happened for the past 20 years and what will happen.  That went all the way to railway order and then was pulled.  Obviously it was a political decision that it was pulled.  Would Mr. O'Rourke have prioritised that?  We can see that the shared road space is causing all sorts of problems.<\/p><p> My next question is for Mr. Mullins on the Port of Cork.  The Port of Cork is much bigger now and Mr. Mullins has described Cobh and Ringaskiddy.  He spoke about there being future infrastructural development and I presume these are the locations he is mainly speaking about.  What role will Cork harbour play in this?  Will it have a central role?  Who owns the land?  It is very close to the city centre and is obviously a key location.<\/p><p> Can the Port of Galway succeed in the absence of transport solutions?  Will investment be attracted where there is an inability to move goods to the port?

My first question is for Ms Cassidy.  She stated the Marine Casualty Investigation Board can make various recommendations.  From what I understand, they may or may not be adhered to.  She has said recommendations can be made to owners but they do not seem to have a legal standing.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Mullins.  It is great to hear the Port of Cork has the capacity to deal with cruise liners with 8,500 people on them.  Obviously it is a deep-sea port.  What is the situation with the export of calves?  I know there is difficulty down south with boats.  Will he enlighten me on what the Port of Cork has done to help the agricultural sector, particularly in the export of Friesian calves to get them out of the country?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. O'Gorman.  I note Mr. O'Gorman spoke about the national planning framework.  How important is it, because if we look at the new national plan, Galway Harbour Company is not in the TEN-T funding?  This was the first thing I looked for when I was trying to do a deal on the programme for Government.  It was said it would apply immediately.  A statement was made here earlier to Mr. Mullins about the loss of TEN-T.  Let us be clear that whether the British stay in or go out, TEN-T funding can be obtained even if a country is outside the EU because it has been done already.<\/p> <p>  It is great to see what the Port of Cork can do and we need to do it in Galway to be able to bring in the likes of those ships.  It is a category two port.  What do we need to do to bring it up to a category one port?  How valuable would it be to put in place the TEN-T funding?  An effort has been made on this but the planning debacle in Galway port has been going on and on.  I wonder if we will ever get an answer.  What has gone on is disgraceful.

With the best will in the world, the Port of Galway has gone to planning and is doing as much as it can.  Mr. O'Rourke is looking for reappointment.  What is being done on this saga?  For a port to survive and get better it needs infrastructure.  The Galway outer ring road will take ten more years if we are being honest.  Is that success or failure?  In my opinion it is failure.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Rourke spoke about safety.  Reviews were done on transport and speed limits throughout the country.  Certain towns made submissions to the councils that were completely overruled by TII.  They wanted to reduce the speed in those towns.  The word we have got back very clearly from the councils, and we have seen what TII has said, is that it would not agree with reducing the speed at the entrance to some towns.  I am astonished at this when we speak about safety.  It was stated there were 500 km or 600 km where safety features would take priority, but these are dragging and decisions need to be made more quickly.<\/p> <p>  Can public private partnerships be done over 20, 25 or 30 years?  What rate of interest is paid on them?  Are design, build and operate contracts used?  We are injecting a large amount of money into getting consultants to do all of this.  I have seen a lot of building work done under design, build and operate contracts, which may cut costs.  I looked at the new national planning framework and the capital plan, and the N4 and N5 are in it and there is a bit between Longford and Mullingar.  There is also the M20, which is welcome.  There is vague mention of Tuam to Sligo.  I do not know whether Letterkenny even exists at this stage.  Why is there not a view that we try over the next ten to 15 years to bring our national routes to dual carriageway status at least?  Why have we not even looked at an idea other countries have looked at, namely, the two and one with a mile of double lane where people can overtake and then a single lane where it may not be possible to put in the two lanes.  Why have we not done more of this?  If we travel in other countries we see it is done.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. O'Gorman give his vision of where he sees the Port of Galway going?  What help does he need from politicians?  It is looking at the largest sea facing us.  It is great that Foynes will be a deep-sea port and it is great to hear about the Port of Cork.

With regard to the safety recommendations, it is correct they are recommendations which may or may not be adhered to but they have been incorporated into the maritime safety strategy.  They have been taken on board, we know, by particular companies in respect of recommendations that have been made and even by individual skippers and owners of vessels who have been involved in incidents.  In these circumstances we do not have a stick to beat people with, and I am not sure that is an appropriate role for us.  We are there to find the cause of an incident and develop the safety recommendations.<\/p><p>The safety recommendations should be broad enough to allow individuals or organisations to make sure they are appropriate for their purposes and indicate how they need to change something or introduce procedures and protocols.<\/p><p> Deputy Robert Troy's first query was about the new process.  No, I did not go through the new process for this appointment.  The extension is only for one year.  We were in the process of looking for a new chairman.  Last year the board changed a lot.  It is a five-member board and last year three members changed.  In addition, the secretariat comprises three members and we had two new members.  There are a number of challenges facing us in terms of a number of reports received and also the incoming general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I made the offer to the Department that I would remain on for one year to allow for a staggered change in the board, rather than have wholesale changes, and my offer was accepted.  I only sought an extra year in my appointment as chairperson designate.<\/p><p> Deputy Robert Troy asked whether my lack of experience affected my ability to do the job.  I may not have provided the committee with sufficient information to enable members to understand the role of chairman.  Obviously, I do not investigate any incident.  We have a panel of investigators who are marine surveyors and engineers who are trained investigators.  We provide them with training courses that allow them to investigate and prepare reports, of which the board has oversight.  We come with the safety recommendations arising from investigations.  It is not the case that I have no experience of maritime matters.  As I have no connection with the maritime industry, I do not see myself as conflicted.  In fact, my role is to ensure there are natural justice, fair and constitutional procedures in place for investigations and the manner in which they are undertaken and reported on.  We also ensure we generate focused recommendations.  My role does not have an awful lot to do with experience of the maritime industry or investigations but more with the reporting element and ensuring there is independence, confidentiality and fair procedures in place. <\/p><p> Deputy Robert Troy asked how many safety recommendations had been directed towards the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.

I understand reappointments are made directly by the Minister.<\/p> <p>  On the question on savings, the original estimate of &euro;3 million came from an bord snip nua, the group chaired by Mr. Colm McCarthy.  It was he who suggested the merger of the Railway Procurement Agency and the National Roads Authority.  Let us say &euro;3 million is the baseline figure and compare it with the figure of &euro;10 million.  When the merger took place, there were just over 300 staff in the two organisations.  We were in the depths of the financial crisis at the time and the employment control framework set the figure at 250.  We have got the number down to 260 and the employment control framework has not been changed since.  However, we can make business cases to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and have done so successfully for the appointment of staff outside the employment control framework.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that the Luas cross-city service has caused major disruption in the city centre, which is regrettable.  We had very significant engagement with the National Transport Authority and Dublin City Council.  We had a public office on Dawson Street which was a drop-in centre and many people availed of the opportunity to make representations.  There has, therefore, been extensive engagement.  It is fair to say a lot of work was done before we started the process on what it would take to transit the city centre.<\/p><p>Our original simulations showed a journey time from St. Stephen's Green to Broombridge of approximately 21 minutes.  That was probably over-optimistic in optimising the sequencing of traffic lights, which is matter for Dublin City Council, rather than Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  There are also issues with motorists' behaviour.  In one well publicised case a Luas tram blocked O'Connell Bridge because a motorist had failed to clear a yellow box.  The Garda is policing the yellow boxes at the junctions of Burgh Quay and O'Connell Bridge and Hawkins Street and Pearse Street.  We hope motorists will change their behaviour over time and not enter yellow boxes unless they can clear them.  <\/p><p> The other issue causing slower journey times is a temporary 10 km\/h speed limit imposed by the Commission for Railway Regulation.  This safety measure which we had not anticipated was introduced at the last moment.  The speed limit on O'Connell Street equates to a slow jogging pace and is only a little faster than a reasonable walking pace - 6 km\/h.  We have realised the behaviour of pedestrians, cyclists and motorists improves over time.  If we go back over the past 12 years, we will find that the number of people walking out in front of trams, the number of cyclists getting in the way of trams and the number of collisions between trams and motorists have reduced significantly and we are hopeful this will be repeated over time.  We estimate that the journey time from St. Stephen's Green to Broombridge will reduce from the current 26 or 27 minutes to approximately 23 or 24 minutes.  On the first day of operation the journey time was approximately 30 minutes.  We are making progress, albeit slowly.<\/p><p> In terms of population increase, I am an engineer who has worked in finance, rather than as a demographer.  As such, I am not qualified to comment on the projection models.  The ESRI model was based on the 2016 census and I understand the national planning framework data were based on the 2011 census.  We are examining what would be the effect of faster population growth.  To assess journey times throughout the country, we need to drill down into small cell data, rather than the overall population. <\/p><p> As to whether we will have the capacity to roll out the major infrastructure, the short answer is yes.  We will manage and can add additional staff.  We also use outsourcing.  If we do not have the ability to do design in-house, we will outsource it to consulting engineers.  <\/p><p> I was surprised by Deputy Robert Troy's comment that we had not applied for the Juncker funds, as they are known.  It is my understanding - I may be incorrect, but I will revert to the Deputy on the matter - that the bulk of the &euro;20 billion made available for infrastructure was in debt.  We received considerable support from the European Investment Bank for the M17-M18 and Luas cross-city projects.  The bank was highly supportive at the time when the country was struggling to raise money on international markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":825,"content":"<p>According to the European Commission, Ireland did not secure any transport funding from the new &euro;500 billion fund announced last year.

It is tricky for someone such as me to comment on these matters because, under the Roads Acts, I am precluded from criticising policy, while also being required to provide advice for the Government, the Department and the joint committee.  No one has ever provided any guidance on how to deal with these conflicting instructions.  The best I have managed, where policy is concerned, has been to try to put independent reputable research, where it is available, in the public domain.  Members should be aware, however, that I am precluded from criticising or commenting on policy.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of an update on the provision of service stations, we continue to spend &euro;20,000 per month in securing the half-built stations, but I do not expect this to continue for a period of 12 months as we are in active discussions with the winning bidder.  As members will be aware, we were held up by a court case which was eventually withdrawn.  We hope we will be able to start construction in the next few months. <\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Imelda Munster, public private partnerships are complicated.  The issue is that it is clearly more expensive to fund a project through a public private partnership.  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice asked what was the relative cost.  Our most recent refinancing - the figure is in the public domain - shows that we refinanced the M17-M18 project at a rate of about 2.5% over 27 years.  The comparable Government gilt rate at the time was approximately 1.5%.

The cost-benefit analysis of the project was a multiple of four, in other words, the benefits equated to four times the cost.  It was a very important project which was completed using a public private partnership and which could not have been undertaken at the time.<\/p> <p>  While the cost of funding under public private partnerships is clearly more expensive, they sometimes allow projects to proceed which would not otherwise be possible to do.  They also include maintenance, which means that at the end of the 25 or 26 year operating period, the road is delivered as good as new.  Roads in public ownership have not always been properly maintained and this must also be taken into account.  The evidence from the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada is that in terms of cost overruns and delays, PPP projects have a better record than conventionally procured projects.<\/p> <p>  To answer the questions on value for money, it depends because there is no free lunch.

I too have adopted the policy adopted by my predecessor where the first item of the agenda at meetings of the TII is conflicts of interest.  In a country as small as ours, they do arise.  I have never worked on road projects in Ireland, but as the Deputy pointed out, I do work a lot with other semi-State bodies.  I have done work for the port of Cork and Mr. Mullins, for other ports, and for other semi-States.  If there is a conflict of interest, the strict policy is that I remove myself, another board member takes over as chair, the item is discussed, I am called back in and told the result.

We could probably make a case for having a greater number of projects under consideration but we do not have the personnel to do that at the moment.  That was the concern I was expressing.  <\/p> <p>  On the funding gap on maintenance which Deputy John O'Mahony also raised, the requirement is approximately &euro;70 million for small maintenance projects, and is about &euro;140 million in terms of capital maintenance, such as resurfacing.  As the management team will have outlined to the committee last week, the this year we are in receipt of about &euro;36 million for small scale maintenance works which is not sufficient to do it.  The capital maintenance figures have come back up from about &euro;70 million to &euro;100 million and the Minister has assured us we will meet both targets by 2020, which is welcome.  I always worry about cutting maintenance at a time when money is in short supply.  It does not always represent good value for money but it is not something we are in control of.

As with everything related to roads, the answer is quite complicated.  Traffic on motorways seems to grow much faster than the traffic elsewhere and seems to be driven primarily by GDP levels.  The other national roads grow more slowly, and the national secondary roads do not grow either with GDP or GNP, they seem to track employment levels.  We are trying to figure out in our modelling what is driving it, but there are different growth rates for the different roads.

Buses can carry approximately 2,000 to 3,000 passengers per direction per hour.  Bus rapid transit, BRT, can carry up to 4,000 per direction per hour.  The Luas can carry up to 8,000 per direction per hour.

I mentioned in my opening statement that we worked with Brittany Ferries on the development of a new route from Ringaskiddy to Santander via a new bridge - a motorway of the sea type route.  We have been working hard for the past 15 months to get that up and running.  The feedback so far is very positive.  For example, previously the fishermen in Castletownbere would have travelled through the land bridge through the UK to the Parisian markets and the Madrid markets but they now have the option of getting to Santander in 26 hours and on to Madrid within four hours.  This is part and parcel of the opportunity for aquaculture and agriculture to get to Spain and for Spanish operators to come to Ireland.  We hope there will be more of this in the future.  In regard to motorway of the seas routes, the reason we did not get finance for equipment upgrades in respect of the Dublin-Belfast-Cork route is because funding in that regard is subject to competition and at that particular time Brexit was not a real issue.  It is now a real issue for Ireland in terms of our imports and exports.  Over 90% of our product is exported through our ports.  When Commissioner Hogan visited the port last month I raised with him the need for a public service obligation fund to support new motorways of the sea routes out of Ireland, whether from Dublin, Galway, Cork or Waterford, to France and continental markets such as Spain.  If there is a hard Brexit and it leads to major queues in Holyhead or in Fishguard this will create an enormous issue for the supply chain.  We need to undertake an audit nationally of the supply chain costs of a hard Brexit for our exporters and importers and to seek recognition in that regard from Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#P01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Mullins"},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":865,"content":"<p>When the European Commissioner for Transport appeared before the committee she indicated that TEN-T was not due for review until 2020 but that that would probably change owing to changing circumstances from the Commission's point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#P01700","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519205400,"counter":866,"content":"<p>To be fair, the Commissioner did mention to me that that should be considered and that we should engage with Europe in that regard.  In the vein of not understanding what Brexit currently looks like, if it hardens then there is a greater case for greater funding.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Troy's question, I did not seek reappointment through the Public Appointments Service.  I was asked if I would consider staying on for another three years and I agreed to do so.  Given the infrastructural changes and projects in hand the view was that continuity would be useful.  There had also been a number of board changes at that juncture.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of timeframe, we expect to be in Ringaskiddy by 2020.  The total cost of Marino Point and all infrastructures in Ringaskiddy is &euro;90 million.<\/p><p>We have full funding for that and I made that commentary in my deposition to the committee.  <\/p><p> The Custom House is a fabulous building and warehouse which is dilapidated.  It is in the heart of the city, the centrepoint of future docklands development.  We already have cranes on Albert Quay, we expect more on Horgan's Quay and the Custom House Quay gives a full loop around the inner city where there are plans for significant development of office space etc.  <\/p><p> In terms of the port services Directive, we are mindful that we are both a regulator and a provider of services.  The committee should be aware we are not the only towage service in Cork Port.  The Doyle Shipping Group provides a service and we compete with it.  Most of the stevedoring in the port is done by the private sector.  <\/p><p> In response to Deputy Barry's comment about privatisation.  I will not give a Port of Cork view but a personal view, and I am well-travelled.  National ports should be never privatised.  They are too important to our infrastructure as an island.  It would be inappropriate to privatise.  In all of my utterances with the Department over five years there has never been an indication that would ever be considered.  <\/p><p> In respect of the relocation to Ringaskiddy and the issue with BAM, we are in the High Court and I need to be very careful.  I will say what is in the public domain, which was cited by Deputy Barry.  After the offer was made to the Port of Cork in a fitting contract, European standard tender, it was claimed a mistake was made by a very large construction company.  The port and I take the simple view that we were given an offer which we accepted and we want to make sure this port is built at the best price on behalf of the State.  The figure of &euro;12 million is not appropriate for us.  On the legal advice we have been given we are taking it very seriously to the point that we have taken BAM to the High Court.  We expect a hearing in July.  Our door is open to the contractor to see if we can speed up that process.  The impact of a year's delay will not be worth &euro;12 million. <\/p><p> In response to Deputy Fitzmaurice, the agriculture sector is vitally important to our region, as the committee knows and the Vice Chairman is very much aware of it.  We have regular interaction with the dairy sector in particular, with Dairygold, Glanbia, Kerry and Danone, which are big manufacturers.  We have had to provide refrigerated capabilities on containers for transportation of proteins etc.  That has been a big investment in the region.  Warehousing is a big issue in the context of inventories for dairy and whey protein product.  We are working with all the main providers on that.  Livestock primarily goes through established roll-on roll-off routes.  Our only current roll-on roll-off route operates during the summer to Roscoff.  That will change with the Connemara ship to Santander also providing a year round link to Roscoff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#P01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Mullins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":868,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mullins.

That was very important.  Mr. Mullins mentioned that 20% of national port activity goes through Cork.

We believe the finance could be made available. To answer Deputy Barry, again there is no plan to sell the port.  There would be no plan whatsoever to sell any part of it.  The plan is to develop it on a build-operate-transfer basis.<\/p> <p>  I did apply through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  It was very good, very quick, much quicker than I thought it would be.  The interview process was excellent.  I have many people to thank for motivating me to apply but I will not go through the list.  I was encouraged by people in Galway.  <\/p> <p>  On planning for Brexit, I agree with Mr. Mullins that when there is a strategy and something changes radically it is necessary to go back and reconsider ports policy to see how this impacts on all these issues, particularly ports because 90% of our goods come in and out by the ports.  We definitely need to re-examine that.  I understand from the Department that the scheduled review is not due to take place until 2021.  It would be appropriate to review the ports.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Murphy's question about traffic, I would say, having come here by taxi today, the problems in Galway are very limited compared to those in Dublin.  It took an incredible length of time to get across a small part of the city this morning.<\/p> <p>  The plans for the port would be to move most of the freight by rail.  There is a rail link adjacent to Ceannt Station.  We plan to bring the railway line to the end of the port, parallel with the berths.  Goods could be unloaded directly onto the freight trains and move off.  We hope tourists coming in on cruise ships will walk across because the port is in the centre of Galway city and they could enter the medieval area there.  Our plans are not for increased road traffic but we have drawn plans for a new road which could go out through Renmore and link up with the motorway.  We could not build the road but we have drafted plans around that, should we see a need for increased traffic on it.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice, Galway Port is a key part of infrastructure for Galway and for the west of Ireland.  If we do not secure planning permission for it the port will decline because ships are getting bigger.  The port can support ships of up to only 5,000 tonnes and many companies do not have ships of that size.  We import petroleum and the petroleum shippers have said they want to scale up to 12,000 tonnes.  If the port declines that will affect any future plans for aquaculture and anything to do with energy on the west coast.  It is vitally important and we submitted our planning application in 2014.<\/p><p>We have a long process ahead of us.<\/p><p> I hope I have responded to all the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":871,"content":"<p>What about TEN-T?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#R00200","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519205400,"counter":872,"content":"<p>We cannot access TEN-T at present although one of our board members, Mr. Frank Greene, has had several meetings in Europe to see how we could access different EU funding which is not under TEN-T.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice O'Gorman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519205400,"counter":873,"content":"<p>Deputy Catherine Murphy asked an important question about land.

It provides emergency rescue services for people in the home and on the road, as well as insurance for more than 200,000 customers.  It specialises in home, motor and travel insurance and attends in the region of 130,000 car breakdowns every year, 80% of which are fixed on the spot.  It is also a campaigning organisation.  From its heritage of representing motorists to its 21st century role, the AA researches and champions consumer needs.  It employs 550 people across Ireland in its growing team.  It has its headquarters in central Dublin where it has approximately 400 staff.  It has been in the broader College Green area since its foundation more than 100 years ago.<\/p> <p>  The College Green traffic management issue has received a great deal of attention recently because of the opening of the Luas cross-city line in December.  The arrival of Luas trams into the mix has revealed how unsustainable the arrangement is, but the traffic problems on College Green date back further than that.   In June 2009 a rush hour ban on private cars using College Green was introduced.  Almost a decade later we are still talking about traffic chaos at that location.  The AA has made the point previously that it frustrates motorists when they find themselves being blamed by default for every planning and transport error, as if the sole cause of the city's problems was selfish motorists who are too snobby to use public transport.  All of the evidence we have demonstrates that the opposite is the case.  Given good public transport services, no motorist has to be forced to use them and no driver chooses Dublin traffic jams if he or she can avoid it.  The \"selfish lazy motorist\" is a fiction; a pantomime villain that Dublin City Council and others choose to blame instead of addressing their own failings.  The traffic problems on College Green deprive the council of that excuse.  Cars have been gone for almost a decade, but the traffic jams are worse than ever.  Bizarrely, the choice now seems to be to blame taxis, which does not make sense.  There is no room for both buses and trams on College Green at current and future Luas frequencies.  As the tram tracks are not going to be moved, the buses will have to.  This needs to be done now or we will be complaining about delays for years to come.  Provision of the College Green plaza will certainly require buses to be removed.  This could have been foreseen and perhaps there are some justified criticisms in that regard, but that is not important; what is more important is getting it right for the future.  Most citizens support the concept of the College Green plaza and when it happens, a change in the traffic arrangements will be required.<\/p> <p>  The primary users of the existing space are the five main transport modes: the Luas, Dublin Bus, taxi drivers, cyclists and pedestrians.  The latter two are modes of transport we should encourage.  In particular, cyclists have reported College Green as being problematic.  In recent months taxi drivers have seen themselves being pushed into the firing line.  A ban on the use of taxis in the area is being heralded as the solution, but we need to face reality.<\/p><p>Taxis are public transport and are very important, especially for tourists and business visitors to the city.  In any case, we do not believe the impact of taxis at that location is the primary cause of the problem.<b><\/b>I repeat that we cannot accommodate buses and trams across the pinch point at Trinity College.  The trams cannot move so the buses will have to move, even if Dublin Bus does not like it.  Pushing the taxis out will make little or no difference.  They will have to leave anyway when the pedestrianised plaza is introduced so they may as well get used to that idea now. <br\/><br\/>The AA has often spoken in praise of Dublin Bus and I will do so again on the record at this forum.  It is the mainstay of our public transport system and the city would be lost without it.  Dublin Bus is arguably under-respected and it is certainly under-funded.  It deserves greater support.  Even so, Dublin Bus must accept the reality that buses cannot stay on College Green.  As it stands, too many routes pass through College Green and there is no good reason for that.  Not everyone needs to get off a bus at Trinity College.  <br\/><br\/>AA Roadwatch obviously observes traffic every day.  One can see queues of buses waiting to access College Street during peak rush hour, from 8:20am to 9:20am.  It is not uncommon to see literally dozens of buses stuck in the queue with nowhere to go.  College Street is also very vulnerable.  It would not take much to block that location, causing tremendous delays to the buses and to the Luas.  From wherever our fascination with as many bus routes as possible serving College Green came, we now need to move beyond it.  We also need to think beyond the day-to-day commuter.  We know we need to make public transport journey times better, especially for commuters.  Important as that is, however, it is not the only measure of success in a city and participants in the debate, including Dublin City Council, often seem to forget this.  Too often the measure of success seems to be how many cars were forced out rather than how much business is brought in.  Dublin needs to succeed not only for its commuters.  Tourists are mentioned a lot but it is local people and local businesses who deserve more support.  Dublin city&rsquo;s traders feel they have been ignored in this debate and I have some sympathy for them in that regard.  Measures designed to make Dublin hostile to cars have been given disproportionate time and attention while measures to support Dublin&rsquo;s businesses do not get anything like the same amount of air time.  Retail customer footfall has not recovered in the city&rsquo;s shopping streets since the financial crisis.  It has fully recovered in places like Dundrum, Blanchardstown and Liffey Valley but not in the city centre.  Grafton Street looks greatly diminished and is quite a distance from the prestige retail street it once was.  When we are thinking about the commercial heart of our city, we need to think not only about transport - important as that is - but also about business and general commerce in the city centre.  It would be of poor comfort to us all if we completely solved Dublin's traffic problems but in so doing we killed the commercial life at the heart of the city. <br\/><br\/>College Green is not the only traffic black spot in Dublin.  We need to take a more holistic view of transport in the city.  We had major delays on the M50 again this morning, which is almost an everyday occurrence.  We need to thoroughly review how we are managing transport and demand in Dublin city.  In so doing, however, we must not take as our only measure of success how well we manage to make buses and Luas trams move.  We must also remember why we want them to move and think about the commercial heart of the city.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Faughnan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":891,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Faughnan.

Dublin City Council, DCC, welcomes the opportunity to address the committee on the issue of traffic congestion at College Green.  Since the launch of Luas Cross City, LCC, on 9 December 2017, there has been significant congestion at College Green which has impacted adversely on the journey times of buses and taxis travelling between O'Connell Street and Nassau Street and on roads that access this corridor, especially during the morning peak traffic period.  In addition, during the initial weeks of LCC operation, in an effort to keep traffic moving, pedestrian priority at College Green was greatly reduced with the result that average pedestrian waiting times more than doubled.<\/p> <p>  The impact of the introduction of LCC on bus journey times for southbound buses travelling through College Green, that is, between O&rsquo;Connell Street and Nassau Street, is set out in the paper submitted to the committee.  If one takes the worst hour, between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., we estimate that before the introduction of LCC that journey would have taken ten minutes on average but after its introduction the same journey was taking 23 minutes.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that major traffic management changes were implemented in the city centre area by DCC prior to the launch of LCC on 9 December 2017 to facilitate its operation.  These changes included the introduction of double bus lanes on stretches of the north and south quays, a ban on general traffic turning right from the north quays onto O&rsquo;Connell Bridge and a range of junction and traffic signal changes.  These changes had a positive impact on bus and taxi journey times. <\/p> <p>  It was always recognised by the council that College Green, which has only one lane in each direction, would not be able to accommodate the same number of buses and taxis following the introduction on LCC.  In order to address this issue, the council developed a separate proposal for a new civic plaza at College Green, which provides for the elimination of all traffic through College Green on an east-west axis.  Under the proposal, the current complex sequence of traffic signals would be replaced with a single pedestrian crossing from the front entrance of Trinity College across to the new plaza.  The plaza proposal would have allowed taxis to use the high quality north-south public transport corridor.  In my paper I have given an example of the conflicting traffic movements on College Green that are the cause of the congestion problems.  The council is of the view that the plaza proposal, with the elimination of east-west traffic, removes those traffic conflicts.  The council is satisfied that the benefits of the plaza as a civic amenity for pedestrians and in terms of greatly improved bus, tram and taxi traffic flow on a north-south axis through College Green due to the elimination of conflicting traffic movements will far outweigh any negative impacts on those bus and taxi services which will have to divert as a consequence of the elimination of east&ndash;west axis traffic through College Green. <\/p> <p>  The College Green plaza proposal, including the associated traffic management arrangements, was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in May 2016.  It had been anticipated that a decision on the proposal would have been made in advance of the opening of LCC.  This would have allowed DCC to implement the required traffic management arrangements.  Unfortunately, there have been delays in the planning process for the civic plaza development.  I have included for member's information a detailed timeline of the planning process.  In deference to the separate statutory procedure for the civic plaza proposal and mindful of the threat of legal proceedings from a city centre business group, DCC and the NTA held off making any other traffic changes pending progress on the plaza application.  An oral hearing on the application, which had been scheduled for 9 January 2018 was postponed on 4 January 2018.  Following this postponement, DCC and the NTA agreed to initiate measures to reduce the volume of traffic travelling through College Green in order to reduce the level of congestion and improve traffic flow.<\/p> <p>  On Monday 29 January 2018, eight bus routes, which previously travelled through College Green and College Street but did not stop there were re-routed and a further nine Xpresso routes were also re-routed away from that area.  The combined effect of these changes has been to reduce the aforementioned 23-minute delay in the worst hour to a 16-minute delay, a significant improvement.  While these measures have reduced journey times in the morning peak, it is very clear that a further reduction in the number of vehicles travelling through College Green is required, particularly given the need to accommodate higher frequency and longer LCC services.  Following further consultation between DCC, the NTA and Dublin Bus it has been agreed that an additional ten bus services will be re-routed away from College Green, effective from Monday, 5 March.  Those measures will be evaluated and if required, DCC will implement further measures in consultation with the relevant parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Owen Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":893,"content":"<p>Thank you.

In the past 18 months I have had the privilege of addressing this committee on Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath's vision for public transport and on the accessibility of our services.  I welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee on congestion and its impact on our city.<\/p> <p>  In October 2016 I outlined to the committee that an efficient public transport system is key to delivering positive economic and social development in our country and in the case of Dublin Bus, to Dublin and its hinterland in particular.  An economically vibrant Dublin is also of benefit to the wider economy.  In 2017 Dublin Bus carried 139 million customers.  We achieved this through strong growth in both our commercial and public service obligation, PSO, network of services.  Dublin Bus customers account for 39% of all retail spend in Dublin city and 62% of all public transport users in Dublin are Dublin Bus customers.  This demonstrates the importance of the bus as a mode of transport in delivering retail spend into the city centre.<\/p><p>Creating an integrated, customer centric, well-functioning and efficient public transport network will assist in delivering economic benefits.  This cannot be achieved in a congested city. <\/p><p> Congestion during the morning and evening peak commute times is a significant problem in Dublin.  Our city&rsquo;s roads are not designed for large volumes of vehicular traffic.  There are many users competing for the limited road space available, including private transport, public transport, cyclists, taxis, delivery vehicles and pedestrians.  As economic growth continues, congestion levels will further increase unless significant mitigating measures are put in place.  Congestion limits a city&rsquo;s ability to achieve its full potential in economic, environmental, social and cultural areas.  Research by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's economic and financial evaluation unit in 2017 estimated the cost of aggravated congestion across Ireland&rsquo;s transport system at &euro;350 million per annum and forecasted this to rise to &euro;2 billion per annum by 2033.  This is not sustainable for transport operators, Government or the public.   <\/p><p> Dublin is positioning itself as a modern European capital and a congested city does not fit with this vision.  Our network speed at peak times is in the region of 14 km\/h, with substantial variations on all public transport corridors.  Despite the significant roll-out of quality bus corridors, private transport remains extremely competitive in terms of journey times to the city, and in many cases is faster than the bus.  <\/p><p> A customer-centric public transport system must have, after safety, three basic fundamentals in place.  These are frequency of service, reliability of service provision and competitive and consistent journey times.  Thereafter, information and price are key for customers.  Congestion is the main barrier to achieving all three fundamentals, while also negatively impacting on price.<\/p><p> One of the key advantages of bus transport is the ability to adapt and accommodate additional customer demand more quickly than other modes.  This is due to the ease and speed at which Dublin Bus can adjust alignments in keeping with a changing, growing city.  The bus network today is far removed from the network that existed prior to 2011 and will continue to evolve in 2018.  Similarly, the road infrastructure and priority in the city has also significantly changed over the past two decades.  These changes have provided tangible benefits for our customers through increased service levels and reduced subvention requirements, allowing for further reinvestment in service provision.<\/p><p> During the construction phase of Luas cross city, significant adjustments were made to the Dublin Bus network to minimise the impact on our customers and assist in the delivery of Luas cross city.  As we transition from construction to operation, Dublin Bus continues to adjust services to benefit our customers, other public transport operators and the city as a whole. <\/p><p> In January 2018, following engagement with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Dublin City Council, 17 bus routes were realigned to improve congestion levels in the College Green area.  Following further engagement between parties and an assessment of current operations, Dublin Bus will realign a further eight routes away from College Green on 5 March, again to enhance the customer experience and to benefit other public transport users and the city. <\/p><p> Unfortunately  the customer experience on some journeys continues to be impacted by congestion, which is not confined to College Green.  Dublin Bus and the economy are growing strongly but it is vital that we do not leave this recovery at our bus stops and stations.  Additional capacity introduced now will benefit our city in the long term and introduce new customers to public transport, mitigating the impact of congestion.  This additional capacity must be matched with continuous improvements to on-street priority throughout the network.  Failing that we will simply be moving congestion from one area to another, rather than what is intended by recent initiatives, which is improving the operating environment for all users of the city, from pedestrians and cyclists to public and private transport users. <\/p><p> Consistent service delivery in the areas of punctuality and reliability is required to deliver a multi-modal mobility solution for public transport in Ireland.  An integrated network of services, information and payment will provide a platform to achieve significant increases in public transport use.  A new bus route is proposed to connect Broombridge Luas and train station to Finglas, Ballycoolin and Tyrrelstown, providing alternative transport modes to our customers.  The NTA continues to support public transport with increased service frequency at both peak and off-peak times added to our bus network since November 2017.  These measures are vital steps in the bid to tackle the congestion currently affecting the city.  <\/p><p> Some key decisions will be required to maximise the use of the finite road space in our capital city.  Congestion has the potential to stagnate economic activity in the city now and over many years to come.  Increasing the use of the public transport network is the best way to tackle congestion.  The implementation of further measures that ensure public transport is a better alternative than the car would enhance our ability to tackle congestion.  At a minimum, our public transport network speed at peak times must increase from approximately 14 km\/h to at least 18 km\/h.  This will provide for a more efficient public transport network, delivering the key requirements of increased frequency, more reliable services and consistent and fast journey times.  With the above improvement in journey times, significant efficiencies would be realised and reinvested in the network, effectively increasing fleet capacity within existing fleet resources.  Underpinned by a commitment to multi-year funding, additional current and capital funding would also be required.<\/p><p> The significant challenges experienced in our operating environment have not reduced customer support for public transport.  We have increased customer numbers on our services every year since 2013.  In December 2017, Dublin Bus recorded double-digit growth on our services.  We are already seeing strong growth in 2018 with 6% organic growth achieved in January.  The introduction of bus priority measures on the north and south quays and the Rosie Hackett public transport bridge have contributed significantly to our growth figures.  The NTA-sponsored BusConnects programme of work will see &euro;750 million invested in the bus network for the greater Dublin area over the next five years, and I welcome the commitment from Government to support this project through the national development plan.  BusConnects will significantly enhance the customer experience in the city in the short term, while providing long-term benefits.  If all aspects of the NTA&rsquo;s BusConnects programme are implemented, it will have a beneficial impact on congestion levels.<\/p><p> In the fourth quarter of 2017, Kantar Millward Brown carried out customer satisfaction research on behalf of the NTA.  Dublin Bus recorded the highest percentage of customers in the &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; category, at 54%, with a score of 92% satisfaction overall.  This is a wonderful testament to our employees and our stakeholders, who continue to recognise the importance of the bus to the economy.  It is also a strong reflection on our service delivery, aided by continuous improvements to bus priority.<\/p><p> Dublin Bus will continue to assist key stakeholders as it seeks to reduce congestion in the city.  College Green is one component of this and addressing one area does not readily solve other areas.  Having a public transport system that is a better option than owning a car is a vision that is achievable and will enable our city to fulfil its potential in many diverse areas.  These include enhanced urban living opportunities, reduced congestion, improved air quality and reduced noise pollution.  It will enable the economy to prosper and provide a platform for a vibrant social and cultural city scene.  It will increase the capacity to deliver people to and from the city with reduced road space, increase the pedestrian environment in the city and enhance the safety for all road users.  Congestion is a barrier to achieving this vision. <\/p><p> The bus is the most flexible mode in delivering significant movement in public transport and will be with us for a long time.  It has the potential to drive the growth in public transport in the short to medium term.  This will lay the foundations to implement priority measures on key corridors with bus rapid transit, BRT, standards, increased frequency levels on corridors to continue customer growth, and provide the space for the implementation of further light and heavy rail over the medium to long term.  Many initiatives announced in the national development plan, Project Ireland 2040, are aligned with this view.  We must act now for the future.<\/p><p> Should the committee have any questions I would be happy to take them as they arise.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519205400,"counter":896,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation to attend today.  I am delighted to be here because I have been managing director of Transdev, the Luas operator, since June 2017.  I have previous history with Luas and Dublin as I had a small part in the original Luas mobilisation team, as operations manager, back in 2004.  I have spent the intervening years as chief executive officer of Seoul Metro in South Korea.<\/p> <p>  For the benefit of the committee members I would like to give you a brief overview of Luas and Transdev's involvement with it since the launch in 2004.  Luas is a state-of-the-art light rail transit system that provides an accessible, attractive and unique mode of public transportation in Dublin.  Transdev is contracted by the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to operate the Luas.  The contractual arrangement within Luas effectively requires the NTA and TII to provide the infrastructure and the trams and Transdev to deliver the operation using these assets.  Transdev is a worldwide organisation with expertise in operating transport systems, including light rail, metro, buses, shuttles and taxis.  I wish to stress that we consider Luas in Dublin as one of our flagship light rail operations.  Transdev has been operating Luas since the commencement of services in 2004 and successfully renewed the operating contract in 2014.  In 2005, the first year of full operation, Luas carried approximately 22 million passengers.  In 2017 Luas carried 37.6 million.<\/p><p>This increase emphasises the remarkable success the light rail system has had in the Dublin area.  In fact, there has been a further 16% increase in passengers from January 2017 to January 2018.<\/p><p> We believe that light rail is an integral part of transportation in Dublin.  Transport planning is critical to achieving growth in public transportation and crucial for the medium and long-term development of Dublin city.  The definitive plan, design and construction of the College Green and how it is integrated within a functional Dublin city is not within Transdev's scope or control.  Luas is only one factor of this complex equation and we work in partnership with all the city stakeholders, including Dublin Bus, NTA, TII and DCC, to achieve the optimal travel times around College Green and across the red and green Luas lines.<\/p><p> However, crossing Dublin city centre in a tram linking north to south is a transport option to be welcomed.  The challenges that are being posed require some refinement and alignment for all stakeholders to address.  While there remains some issues at present, I am convinced these issues can be addressed soon.<\/p><p> This concludes my short statement.  I also am happy to take questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Lunden-Welden","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":898,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lunden-Welden.

Do we have an indication as to when it will be introduced, what the exact route will be, what the frequency of the service will be and how it will be promoted?  I am conscious that sometimes new routes - this one will be beneficial and will be exactly what we want to see, which is integrated public transport between Dublin Bus and Transdev which is great - are not promoted correctly and die on their feet.  I am not saying that is the recent experience but certainly in the past, that has happened.  I would be curious to hear about the promotion piece in particular as well and when it will be introduced because we could be promoting it right here and right now if we had a date for introduction.<\/p> <p>  The city centre fare was abolished recently.  What was the rationale behind that?  We may come back later to Mr. Coyne's own views on whether the rerouting of ten buses at College Green will make a substantive difference to the experience there.<\/p> <p>  Finally, for Transdev, I seek Mr. Lunden-Welden's views on what has been proposed in the Project Ireland 2040 plan regarding the potential expansion of the operations, in particular to Finglas, which I understand is to be the prioritised line of the four potential expanded lines.  I would be curious to hear whether Transdev has ongoing consultation with the NTA in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, what are Transdev's views on O'Connell Street and the Luas operations there?

One would not necessarily walk down to Marlborough Street speculatively to get on a tram and then have to walk back to get a bus.  What are Mr. Lunden-Welden's thoughts on whether there should be real-time signs installed on O'Connell Street to get the most out of College Green?  Right now, there is congestion on College Green but we may not be getting the optimum number of passengers going south.  I have certainly noticed that and I imagine the data bear it out as well.

Some of them have been redirected already.  I looked at the figure for the number of buses and the areas from where they are originating and they include Monkstown, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Bray, Ashtown, Clondalkin, Dundrum, Lucan, Blanchardstown, Malahide, Balbriggan, Swords, Leixlip, Maynooth and Celbridge.  Some of them are city speeds.  That tells us that it is not just buses that are being discommoded; it is people.<\/p> <p>  Part of the reason some of the termini were selected was because there is an inadequate amount of kerb space for buses in the city, so people have got used to this route across city.  As far as I can recall, when the Luas line was being selected, Dublin Bus had a lot to say about this being a potential problem for it.  This is not a teething problem, therefore; it is something that was foreseen.<\/p> <p>  What modelling are the various organisations doing, even at this late stage, to do it not just on a piecemeal basis but to examine the likely scenarios if some of the buses are redirected?  It is very difficult for people to get used to different routes.  They will be fixed on a public transport route.  They select it because it gets them to their destination, and the destination is not always a terminus; sometimes it is somewhere in between.  That discommoding of a very large population that, generally, is on the periphery of the city is likely to lose market share for Dublin Bus.  What modelling is being done to deal with that?<\/p> <p>  Going back to the Dublin transportation initiative, Luas would have been part of that, but so also would other initiatives, for example, the DART underground.  In the provision of public transport, is there surface room for what we need if those type of alternatives to public transport are not provided?<\/p> <p>  With regard to Dublin City Council, Dublin is our capital city.  I represent Kildare North, but I am a Dubliner who has gone in the other direction.  I do not have anything negative to say about Dublin, but there is a mindset that is about looking at the city centre as though it is a functional area as opposed to it being a capital city that has, whether we like it or not, a sizeable amount of the population in the greater Dublin area that requires to be taken into account when changes in the city centre are being considered.  What networking is done with regard to the greater Dublin area?  The College Green issue definitely translates as though it is a city centre issue but if we are to discommoding people, we are discommoding people who are travelling into the city rather than people who are living in it.  What networking is done to consider people from outside of the functional area of Dublin?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#X00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":920,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy John Lahart who will be followed by Deputy Eamon Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#X00400","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome all the attendees.  I appreciate them giving their time here and the contributions they have made.  There is no action without an equal and opposite reaction is a dictum that can be applied to this issue, but we have to live with it.  We have to be practical in terms of what has happened.  In many ways, in terms of what has been happening in recent months and also the witnesses' presentations today, for Dublin Bus and the taxi drivers it is a little bit like a variation of the prodigal son.  Taxis and Dublin Bus, and I thank them on behalf of Dubliners for keeping the city moving, particularly in the midst of all the Luas cross city construction, have been the loyal, hard-working labourers serving in the vineyard for the past 40 years.  Luas is the new kid on the block.  It has a big advantage.  It has rails in the ground and it is not going anywhere, and that is reflected in the contributions.  I warmly welcome Luas and Luas cross city.  Luas cross city is the only immovable force; it is the only immovable object.  We have to accept that everybody else will have to be flexible because Luas is not going anywhere.  Ultimately, despite all the criticisms that have been made of it, any new transport initiative will have to be given a period of time to bed in.  I believe everybody accepts that, but I have questions for Transdev Ireland.  It is solving some of the problems with real time and so on, so I will give it the benefit of the doubt on that.  Passenger safety is a real concern, as is overcrowding.  The witnesses might address that briefly.<\/p> <p>  I do not know, but I accept Mr. Owen Keegan's bona fides as chief executive officer of Dublin City Council on this issue.  It is an elected body that has decided to pedestrianise a plaza that is part of the centre traffic spine of the city.  I accept that is what it intends to do, and I believe we have to bite the bullet on that.  We cannot have a lot of public transport moving through that space if it is to be a pedestrian plaza.  I am sorry for the clich&eacute;s, but we cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs.  I am assuming there are things that can be done, and that need to be done, to alleviate the situation for taxi drivers in the context of that.  One of those is that taxis, which are an essential part of public transport, ought to have access to some of the bus corridors to which they do not currently have access.  I have noticed that in terms of some of the routes taxi drivers have to take around the core of the city, the amount they add to a fare is considerable.  For example, their inability to access the bus corridor on St. Stephen's Green does not make much sense to me.  There are a number of things that need to be done regarding public transport.<\/p> <p>  For Dublin Bus, the witnesses are all disparate voices here.  When did they all last meet together as a group to discuss this issue, or did they meet?  Has the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport called them and all the other stakeholders in to discuss it and to hear their individual views, not just on the plaza issue but the Luas cross city issue?  Where are the representatives of the Garda traffic corps, which has an essential role to play in this, particularly in the bedding in of the Luas?<\/p> <p>  The central spine of Dublin Bus has been taken away.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, Dublin Bus is serving the people who are not served by Luas, DART or trains whose landing points and terminal points when they come into the city are getting further away from where they used to be able to locate and get off.  There are certain issues on which we have to make decisions.  Luas cross city is here.  It is immovable, so everything else will have to work around it in terms of transport solutions.  The longer trams are longer because they have bigger capacity.  It is too late now, but what particular consideration was given to the fact that O'Connell Bridge is 45 m long and the trams are 55 m long?<\/p><p>The tram will always have its way but, as far as I understand, at peak time the tram will cross the bridge every three minutes.  It takes 50 seconds to 90 seconds to cross the bridge and it must clear it, which leaves a minute and a half for taxis, bikes, commercial vehicles, buses and everyone else coming up and down the quays.  The city manager must provide us with some kind of insight into this.  If 300 buses are taken out of College Green every hour, 3,000 every day, where will they go?  We do not want this patchwork quilt of responses.  This is not directed at the chief executive.  He is only part of the strategy, and I accept that.  It may take a little time - for example, six months - to come up with an overall master plan.  A point I made yesterday is that the transport map of Dublin is being rewritten and redrawn before our eyes and this cannot be done in a patchwork way; it must be done in a comprehensive way.  The witnesses may have to take some time to do this in order that they and all other stakeholders come together, except Luas because it is immovable and everything now must work around it.  Luas is in a very happy position and it is justified because of its passenger-carrying capacity, but Dublin Bus's passenger-carrying capacity is significantly in excess of that of Luas.<\/p><p> My big bugbear is that there is no one person accountable, elected or appointed who can pull all these voices together in one room.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport can, but there is no Dublin authority that can pull together every single one of the witnesses' organisations as stakeholders in this debate.  They will have to be pulled together regularly over the next year or so in order to thrash this out, sort it out and come up with a solution.  This is not London.  We do not have an underground.  I hugely, wholeheartedly welcome Luas cross-city but I am thinking of the emasculation of taxis and Dublin Bus from the spine of the city.  Anyone could have seen that this was coming.  Again, this is not aimed at Mr. Keegan.  He is just part of the tapestry of solutions.  The National Transport Authority is not represented here today even though it is the responsible body.  I think Dublin Bus is getting the brunt of all this and sucking up an awful lot in this process.  In fairness to Dublin Bus, it is adapting, but someone must pull all this together.  Dublin Bus cannot be penalised regarding all the big gaps of the population of Dublin that are not served by rail of whatever variety.  Dublin City Council is just in charge of the city, and this is impacting the suburbs and the other four Dublin local authority areas.  No one has a big plan.  No one even has a big plan as to how to devise a big plan.  Dubliners and Dublin commuters deserve much better than this.  We need someone to pull ideas together and come up with a vision that everyone can buy into.<\/p><p> I have a question directed at Transdev.  It concerns serious overcrowding and security.  Does Mr. Lunden-Welden agree with the notion of public transport police, particularly regarding the city centre, because the kind of passenger-carrying capacity Transdev has?  I have one final question on behalf of all the shift workers who either come into the city to work or live in the city and go out into the suburbs to work.  They rely after a particular time exclusively either on their own cars or on taxis to get themselves to work.  Does Transdev have any plans regarding Luas cross-city to expand the hours to serve an increasingly mobile population?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#X00500","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":923,"content":"<p>Before I move on to Deputy Ryan, to clarify, the NTA was not invited.

I was very involved in the Platform for Change plan in the late 1990s and early 2000s, up to 2001.  I remember with such clarity discussing the options and coming down on the metro because of the clear modelling which showed that if we did not do so, we would not be able to make the numbers work and would have bus jams on D'Olier Street, and, hey presto, we now have bus jams on D'Olier Street.  This is not new but we must sort it out now big time and quickly.<\/p> <p>  I commend Mr. Conor Faughnan.  I agree with the simple analysis he gave.  He said one cannot accommodate the buses and trams across the pinch point at Trinity College.  The trams cannot move so the buses will have to.  It is a tough reality, but he hit the nail on the head when he said that.  I wish to ask three questions, if I may, and I appreciate the opportunity to contribute.  First, I agree with what was said about Dublin Bus.  I am not surprised about what Mr. Coyne said about Dublin Bus's customer satisfaction ratings because that is my experience of talking to friends, family and others.  Dublin Bus services have improved.  The Wi-Fi services, the real-time information, just the overall service in Dublin Bus is good in very difficult circumstances, and we commend the company on that.  However, I have a real concern.  We had the chairman of TII before the committee earlier.  I know TII is not in charge of the BusConnects project but, informally chatting to him afterwards, we kind of agreed nothing seems to be happening.  Where are we in delivering the big BusConnects project, which might help us to ramp up and improve Dublin Bus services?  When can we expect them to go to tender and come into operation?<\/p> <p>  Second, regarding light rail, I know my colleague, Deputy Catherine Martin, was asking for a representative of Transdev to come before the committee so I am very glad Mr. Lunden-Welden was able to come today to respond to these questions.  I have two immediate questions.  I am a light rail customer and, like so many customers on the green line, I now face a situation whereby three, four or five trams pass by before I can get on one.  It is like the Tokyo underground at present at Milltown, Beechwood, Windy Arbour and any of the other stations.  We are squeezing on like the Tokyo underground.  In the old days there were photos of people pushing passengers onto the trains.  That is what we need.  In these circumstances, what is Mr. Lunden-Welden's advice to someone in a wheelchair who is looking to access light rail on pretty much any Luas service, particularly at peak hour on any inbound or outbound train?  We heard from Dublin Bus of the concern about public transport speeds being 40 km\/h.  I was talking this morning to a friend who goes from Broombridge to Adelaide Road every day, a perfect customer for Luas cross city.  He says he is quicker walking from Broombridge to Adelaide Road.  I am interested to know Luas's times, particularly because Mr. Keegan said in his presentation that we may have to look at losing some of the priority for Luas in the city centre.  Given it is so slow, it seems, and the current situation, I am interested in Mr. Lunden-Welden's views on losing priority in terms of Luas's speeds.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I know Dublin City Council is hampered here because it is operating within the constraints given that we did not proceed as we should have done with the metro.  I agree fully with what was said earlier about the need for a mayor for Dublin.  My experience of those 25 years - I do not know about Deputy Murphy's - is that inevitably there was inter-agency rivalry and too many different authorities.  We really need someone to pull this together.  I am very interested to hear from Mr. Keegan some specific details on cycling because I am also a cyclist.  Who designed the cycling elements of this scheme?  It is not just College Green; what has happened in Stephen's Green is a travesty for cyclists and a missed opportunity to provide all sorts of counter-flow and other measures.  I have several friends who, particularly at College Green, have come off their bicycles, some with broken arms, others with various other injuries.  I myself have cycled on College Green.  I am a very experienced cyclist, very comfortable on streets and very well able to cycle in Dublin but I am terrified coming from Pearse Street direction going right up Dame Street.  It is incredible that anyone designed that facility with cyclists in mind.  Cycling is part of the solution here.  The experience we have had when we put in high-quality cycling corridors, like along the Grand Canal, is, I understand, an almost immediate 50% increase in the cycling numbers.  The answer to this problem we have of how to get everyone into the city and around is surely to provide the key cycling networks we need such as the Liffey Valley cycle route.  The canal cycle route has been upgraded further and works have been carried out on the College Green plaza.  Does Mr. Keegan have the necessary funding to make this happen?<\/p><p>Does he have the necessary staff resources, the design teams and the in-house expertise to address the fact that cyclists are completely forgotten about in the Dublin transport system?  We are the most vulnerable but are being left behind and this has to stop.  Dublin can and should be a brilliant cycling city and there is huge pent-up demand for someone brave enough to create a safe space on our streets.<\/p><p> If we followed Mr. Conor Faughnan's advice and did what the city council has always planned to do, which is to do the plaza with the introduction of the cross-city Luas on College Green, is there a preferred route?  Has a decision been made as to whether the reorientation of buses would mean using Parliament Street, Christchurch or Westland Row?  I know that Dublin Bus has to ensure that this works with BusConnects but I think it can do so, given the priority afforded to buses on the quays.  Where is the alternative north-south crossing point in the city centre?  Garrett FitzGerald was right that Trinity College presents a fundamental problem in the middle of the city and limits the scope for crossings.  How do we cross over if we do not cross College Green?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#Y00800","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":931,"content":"<p>I apologise to witnesses for being absent for the past few minutes but we were accepting a petition relating to a minimum passing distance for cyclists of 1.5 m.  Cycling can play a huge role in preventing congestion.  The number of people who cycle in our capital city has doubled in the past two years but the funding allocated by the Department for cycling projects has decreased by almost 50%.  I am interested in what Mr. Keegan has to say about the capacity to roll out a greater cycling infrastructure in the capital.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Faughnan was right that congestion is not exclusive to the Luas crossover although it has compounded the congestion problem.  Congestion has been getting worse in recent years and there has been a lack of preparedness on the part of key stakeholders in regard to the crossover.  We are failing our citizens miserably and robbing them of their lives as they are spending more and more time commuting to and from work.  It affects other local authority areas in Dublin and not just the city centre, and it also affects areas such as my own constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  People are now getting up at 5.30 a.m. to come to work in the city and they do not get home until after 7.30 p.m. or 8 p.m.  They do not get to see their children getting up in the morning and they do not get to put them to bed in the evening.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Keegan said he had hoped that An Bord Plean&aacute;la would have made a decision on the College Green crossover before the opening of the cross-city line but why had Dublin City Council not submitted its application in plenty of time, to enable it to get a decision?  Instead, it lived on a wing and a prayer and it hoped that An Bord Plean&aacute;la would reply in time.  This is a massive investment of public money in infrastructure in the capital city.  Mr. Keegan also said he did not have responsibility for the rerouting of buses and that is correct, as the NTA has that responsibility.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking and it is not okay for one arm of the State to blame another arm of the State for the fact that this has not been done.  Planning permission was submitted for the Luas cross-city in 2010, almost eight years ago, and it did not come up overnight like a mushroom.  I am sure the plans were prepared many years in advance of 2010 but we have not responded correctly at all.  In correspondence sent to us two days ago, eight additional bus routes were referred to as being rerouted but last night the news stated that ten were being rerouted.  It appears that it is being made up as we go along.  Why was it eight on Monday but ten on Tuesday evening?<\/p> <p>  There is a finite amount of road space in the area of which we are speaking.  Is a decision going to be taken?  Some &euro;380 million's worth of tracks are in the ground and are not going to be taken up.  What is the overarching plan to deal with this?  One third of Dublin Bus traffic goes through this area.  That is one third of the 140 million passengers who use the service on an annual basis.  Is the plan to remove buses altogether from the area?  If it is, let us be upfront and honest with people about it.<\/p> <p>  Dublin Bus is agile and has the ability to respond.  Can Mr. Coyne tell us how many additional buses there have been in the fleet in recent years?  It was said that there were 100 but my understanding is that a significant percentage of those are replacement buses and not new buses.  What do the witnesses think about the possibility of the establishment of one body with overall responsibility for traffic management in our capital city?  It is not good enough for one side to blame the other and to shift the responsibility to someone else and it does not wash with the general public.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the two taxi representatives.  They have a pivotal role to play, particularly for the business community visiting Dublin and for tourists, who may not be aware of the various public transport options and hail a taxi because they have confidence that the taxi can get them to their destination with relative ease.

We are banning east-west traffic and reinforcing the north-south axis for all modes of public transport.  We believe that by removing the conflicts associated with catering for east-west traffic, it will work for all modes.  We can send the committee details of this.  In developing the plaza plan we believe it will work for all modes.  It will be possible to service all hotels in the area.  Taxis can access close to College Green.  They cannot pass through College Green, east-west, but they can certainly get close, almost as close as Foster Place.  We believe the plan caters adequately for all modes.<\/p> <p>  It is important to appreciate that there is no solution that would allow the successful operation of the Luas without some impact on the other modes.  We are also dealing with other sustainable modes as cars have long gone.  We do not like to discommode bus passengers or taxi users.  However, there is a bigger prize in ensuring the successful operation of the Luas.  That is why we developed a proposal which allows for the successful operation of the Luas with the minimum inconvenience to other modes.<\/p> <p>  The plaza plan proposal has been held up.  In the meantime, we are working well with Dublin Bus and the National Transport Authority, NTA, to address the congestion issue.  There was no intent on my part to blame the NTA.  It was just a factual statement.  We have been working closely with the NTA and Dublin Bus on the changes needed to deal with the congestion issue.  If further changes are required, we will work with the other bodies affected.<\/p> <p>  We are conscious of the role of the city centre in the use of transportation services which originate in outer areas.  Getting the city centre working is important for everybody.  It is just as important for routes which commence outside the city council area.<\/p> <p>  A technical issue was raised as to why taxis were not given access to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  The legal position is that we cannot give access to contraflow bus services such as the one on St. Stephen's Green.  We would welcome if the position was reviewed.  However, that is the legal position and the arrangement in which we must operate.<\/p> <p>  We are committed to improving cycling infrastructure.  The cycle elements associated with the Luas cross-city line were designed by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and clearly there are issues with them.  A solution mooted was that we ban cyclists, but we held up against it.  We will have to revisit elements of it because it is not satisfactory.  We have sought to improve the position on College Green by introducing a new two-way cycle track.<\/p> <p>  Our difficulty with funding is getting political support at council level.  We were delayed in providing a cycle route on the north quays because we could not get the agreement of members to bring forward a scheme.  We have approved a cycle route from Clontarf to the city centre, but members are seeking independent legal advice to stop it.  We are running into political difficulties in getting the council&rsquo;s support.  We are enthused about cycling and realise the contribution it makes.  It is the fastest growing mode of transport in the city and we are keen to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Owen Keegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519205400,"counter":936,"content":"<p>On the time savings that will be made with the additional measures, the original measures removed 60 buses at peak hours and saved 20% in journey times.

Once a week we meet representatives of Dublin Bus to review all of the data accumulatesd from the whole of the city to see where there are particular pinch points and where changes may be needed.  According to these data, we will implement some changes.  An example of how it worked was on the north and south quays.  The data analysis showed that was the single worst route for Dublin Bus in the city and a plan was drawn up to deal with it.  We are grateful for the way we work with Dublin Bus in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Once a week we also meet Transdev to go through particular issues which arise throughout the entire Luas network.  We regularly meet the NTA, Dublin Bus and TII, particularly to discuss the College Green aspect.  This afternoon I am due to meet TII again.  That shows the level of co-operation.  Every single vehicle in the Dublin Bus fleet transmits information to the city council every 20 seconds on where it is, if it is at a stop, the route it is serving and if there is congestion.  We use data analysis to track what is happening.  Dublin Bus also has dedicated staff working on the issue.<\/p> <p>  The particular proposal to introduce a plaza in the College Green area was examined in both the NTA's eastern regional model and by microsimulation.  The latter also took into account cycling and so on in the area.  The reason there is such emphasis on College Green is the number of routes which currently pass through it.  We submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la a list of routes for Dublin Bus, as well as other bus services, and proposals for how they could run through Winetavern Street, Parliament Street, with additional routes on Dawson Street and the use of Westland Row.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":937,"content":"<p>What is involved in a microsimulation model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#AA00400","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519205400,"counter":938,"content":"<p>Normally, when carrying out modelling work one is looking at demand, complex land-use and census data.

When we looked at the north and south quays and implemented public transport measures in August, we introduced two specific measures.  One was a bus priority measure by which we could control the volume of general traffic that made it to Bachelors Walk to give priority to public transport.  The second measure, which was the key one, was the introduction of a right turn ban on cars turning on to O'Connell Bridge.  That was designed to allow public transport to smoothly flow through that area.  The Deputy is correct that there was an issue with the longer trams and the Luas crossing smoothly from the south side to the north side without stopping on the bridge and interfering with traffic.  When we looked at maintaining the current traffic flow, it simply was not going to work.  Introducing those measures has alleviated many of the concerns.  Now that the longer trams are starting to go into service, we have worked through how we make sure they go across the bridge but we have to put in an important caveat, which is that there is shared running.  The Luas does not have its own dedicated space on O'Connell Bridge; it shares with other modes of transport.  If a bus or a taxi is stopped in front of a tram and does not allow it to proceed, the tram from time to time will block the south quays or if that happens on the Rosie Hackett Bridge, it will block the north quays.  We have tried to minimise that by placing the emphasis on public transport and reducing the volume of traffic entering the D'Olier Street-College Green area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#BB00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":948,"content":"<p>According to what Mr. O'Brien said, the city council ignored the consequences of 55 m Luas trams.

The tram cannot stop on O'Connell Bridge or the Rosie Hackett Bridge without blocking either the south or north quays and, therefore, our response, which we put in place last August, was to make sure that public transport could move.  The stated objective we had at the time was to remove some of the bottlenecks for public transport in the area and to make sure that the introduction of the tram on O'Connell Bridge did not cause problems for public transport on the north and south quays.  Those measures have been successful.  Originally, we had examined whether we needed to remove cars from Bachelors Walk completely but we did not do that.  They can still travel down Eden Quay and the south quays.  We, therefore, took appropriate measures to safeguard public transport in the area.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect of this is cycling and we have always steadfastly said, as Mr. Keegan pointed out, that we need to accommodate cycling in the city centre because that is the growth mode currently.  The measure we took, particularly on the north and south quays, to introduce more public transport priority assisted cyclists in large numbers.

There were a couple of key drivers in the decision made last year to abolish the city centre fare.  One was the value of the Leap card.  The city centre fare was not there when the card was introduced and that gives significant value to our customers, with discounts for more than 25% versus cash fares.  There is capping as well and many free journeys are gained by regular users.  The rationale, therefore, for a city centre fare is significantly diminished.<\/p> <p>  We have also embarked with the NTA over the past five years on a fare simplification programme with a view to the long term.  We are improving services and making it easier for customers to understand.  The complexity of fares was a significant barrier and we set out on a programme of reducing complexity and removing the city centre fare was part of that.  The final issue in this regard is the removal of the ten buses.  Mr. O'Brien addressed that in terms of the expected improvements but some of the changes - northwards of 30% on some alignments - will be monitored over the coming weeks but we expect to see similar improvements.<\/p> <p>  I do not have the specifics on the 40L route.  We have a planning framework for new services.  The proposal is moving along through the framework with the NTA and, therefore, I am not at liberty to give the final alignment.<\/p><p>The frequency is in or around a 30-minute headway, which would be matching in with the Broombridge Luas end.  As for marketing, we will be lending our expertise to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to do that.  We have a significant team in our marketing department that has significant knowledge and expertise in the direct marketing of bus routes, and we use a lot of social media in that area.  It has proven to be successful in the past and we will make sure that is done in this area as well.<\/p><p> The College Green area was raised a number of times and it has been discussed for many years.  It is a key area of Dublin city.  It is a transit corridor.  My predecessors 20 years ago were probably arguing the same point I am arguing, namely, that it is a transit corridor in Dublin city, people are transported to that area and they then disperse.  Not everybody travelling into the city gets off a bus at College Green and has a two-minute walk to their office or to the retail store or leisure facility to which they wish to go.  They may have significant walk distances.  If the College Green bus gate was removed, the walk distances involved for commuters could be excessive.  The Trinity College area was mentioned.  The next access point would be a long way down Westland Row and if people want to get to Grafton Street, Nassau Street, Stephen's Green North and such areas, it can be a long distance to walk.<\/p><p> Dublin Bus has been engaged in planning with Dublin City Council and the NTA.  As was rightly stated, we knew this was coming down the tracks.  In 2011, Dublin Bus implemented the largest network redesign in Europe.  Some Deputies may recall that at that time we removed on-street termini from the city centre.  If we consider the Luas alignment that is in place now and the previous termini for bus routes in the city centre, it is what it is.  Parnell Street West, Parnell Street East, Parnell Street North, Marlborough Street, Hawkins Street, Pearse Street, Fleet Street and Aston Quay used to be bus termini but they are no longer are.  That was done in 2011.  The reason it was done then was that we were undertaking the largest network review in Europe and we said we would plan for the future and the Luas cross city project was to happen.  We thought there was no point in coming back in 2017 and being asked that as we knew this was happening, why did we not make the changes?  Consequently, we made those changes.  The network we have today is totally different from what was there previously.  <\/p><p> The College Green bus gate is the single biggest benefit to bus users in the city over the past 20 years.  There are complementary bus lanes throughout the city which are welcome, but that bus gate is a massive boost to public transport.  I commend the councillors at the time on implementing that bus gate.  Many bus lanes operate from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. during which time priority is given to buses but that period needs to be extended.  We need to get more people using buses.  Bus lanes giving buses priority need to operate for a longer period.  The College Green bus gate facilitated a network review and our growth of having up to 139 million customers.  <\/p><p> We need bus priority, reliability, punctual consistent journey times and to bring customers where they want to go.  It is not where the bus wants to go but where customers want to go.  If we can get that working in our city centre, that would be brilliant.  We need to realign our services around that.  However, at this point in time there are not many alternatives.  That is why it is such a complex area.  We discuss this with Dublin City Council and the NTA and we have not been found wanting in our readiness to adjust our services.  In January we adjusted 17 services and we will adjust ten services on 5 March.  We will monitor that and if there are further requirements, we will do what is best for our customers but also what is best for the city.  We are so vital to the economic vibrancy of the city that we need to make sure that is maintained.  We do not want a city where buses can all the priority in the world but nobody is travelling into the city on the buses because the shops are closing. We are very conscious of our role in ensuring that the economy in Dublin city is vibrant and continues to progress.  The College Green bus gate has been in place for 20 years because it is such a key area in the city and the confines around it.  We in Dublin Bus have shown our willingness to move and preplan, which we have done during the last eight years, and we will continue to do that bearing in mind the interests of our customers, the city and all our stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#BB01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":953,"content":"<p>Mr. Coyne mentioned that there are not many alternatives but what alternatives are there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#CC00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519205400,"counter":954,"content":"<p>Deputy Eamon Ryan asked a question on area.  If we consider route buses travel in the city, and Deputy Ryan mentioned a wide area of Dublin city from which people travel into the city.<\/p> <p>People travelling from Blanchardstown in the city benefit from the College Green bus gate.  Many people do not use it but the consistency of the bus journey time benefits them as they are travelling in from further out of the city.  The consistency of the journey time and the fact that it is not variable also makes our services more frequent.  We used to have 40-minute spikes but the College Green bus gate wiped much of that out in its early phases.  If we were to remove the College Green bus gate, the next location, as essentially it involves crossing the Liffey, would be Parliament Street, which is the next bridge.  I would not consider Parliament Street having regard to how it operates today.  From a planning point of view, there is traffic on Parliament Street, there is a bridge and this turn and that turn but we would need to examine it to ascertain what would be possible in that context.  In its current state it is not a suitable alternative because one cannot turn left off the quays on to Parliament Street.  Buses go through College Green to go up George's Street, but if the route was down the quays, I believe the next left-hand turn would be down at Church Street and how would buses get back to go up George's Street?  As we view it, Parliament Street is one side while the other side is essentially Westland Row at the back of Trinity College.  Those are the two edges of it but many people are travelling north of that and consequently, one must try to get the buses back there.  If we were to send people down to Bridge Street and then send them back into town, that would not be suitable.  There is the issue of our customers' experience but there is also the matter of a responsibility for the economy of the city.  We need to attract customers on to buses and to bring them into the city centre for work, retail purposes and social and cultural life.  If we were to make the restrictions so stark that it turns people away, we would end up with increasingly fewer people using public transport.  That would be a downward spiral.  I would suggest Parliament Street is the next closest alternative and it would need significant adjustments in traffic movement within those areas.  <\/p> <p>  I do not believe it is a zero-sum game.  College Green is a multi-modal area at present and I am sure it will remain so after whatever decisions are made and it should remain so.  I am not speaking only in the context of buses and the Luas.  It is not the case that if there were zero-sum buses, the problem would be solved.  We need to consider wider issues.  We are not the only provider operating in that area along with the Luas.  There are many vehicle movements in it and that needs to be taken into account in any future decisions.  We have been consistent on that, particularly since 2016.  We have advocated for a multi-modal approach.  We know the city certainly is not about Dublin Bus but from my perspective, it is about having integrated public transport.  That is what we need to work towards.  It is complex.  If there was an easy resolution, it probably would have been addressed 20 years ago but it is complex.  A significant portion of the economy in Dublin city is at stake.  Therefore, moving buses tomorrow from that area is not an option for the economy.  Buses can move anywhere but in terms of maintaining public transport and contributing to the economy, buses are crucial and we need to consider that.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Ryan for his kind comments, which are a great reflection on all our employees.  I will make sure that is fed back to our employees.  They do tremendous work in delivering our services bearing in mind we have had a significant increase in passenger numbers.  <\/p> <p>  The BusConnects plan is an NTA programme of work funded by the Government.  It comprises a suite of nine initiatives, some of which will be long term with regard to integrated ticketing, cashless ticketing, account based ticketing and fare simplification, which I mentioned earlier.  We are progressing some of those issues as we proceed.  Significant infrastructural improvements are required, including park-and-ride sites and significant interchange in areas.  The NTA is working on that.  Dublin Bus will feed in its expertise into that.  We have a long history of expertise in managing, planning and implementing bus networks, which have brought ancillary benefits for our customers.  We will feed our views to the NTA.  One of the earliest indicators in this respect is that BusConnects provides for increased frequency and increased service levels.  We have been adding buses to our routes during the last year.  During the past three years, we have added north of 20% to services.  BusConnects will be part of that.  We have started to introduce the services.  There is a network redesign in BusConnects and we did the largest one in Europe in 2011.  We are feeding our information into the NTA.  At present, it is in charge of this and is leading it.  I understand there will be a consultation period, which will commence in the second quarter of this year.  That will be a full redesign of the total bus network in Dublin.<\/p><p>We have significant experience of doing it successfully and we will feed that into the NTA.  I believe the public consultation will take place in the second quarter.  Initiatives are occurring in the background, but we will put a BusConnects brand on that at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":956,"content":"<p>We already know the cross-city BRT plans for Tallaght and UCD have been agreed.

We can look to recent improvements in Drumcondra where there was a compulsory purchase order on land.  BusConnects provides a huge amount of that and it is necessary.  What was done on the Stillorgan Road 20 years ago is the exemplar.  There was a lot of angst about the plans at that time.

We also operate a direct-award contract.  At present 100% of our services are direct award, outside our commercial services.  An integrated network requires just that - integration.  We would be strong advocates that a direct-award contract provides the integration required.  We have increased our bus fleet by more than 20% in recent years.  We have done that within our direct-award contract.  Any decision to tender further bus routes is out of the hands of Dublin Bus; it is a Government decision and a policy decision of the NTA.  Dublin Bus will make a decision at the time as to whether it would tender from that point of view.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy made a fair comment - eight changed to ten.  We made the decision the other day that we could change another two routes; there are only two trips on them, but nonetheless it comes out as two routes.  I knew I would be asked the question today.  It is certainly not that we were making it up.  We just made the decision that we could possibly do another two and decided to go after that.  That shows Dublin Bus is progressive in making adjustments to assist in addressing the congestion in the city.  If it gave that impression, I am sorry it did.  It is certainly not that we are making it up.  As I said, since 2011 we have been planning route realignments related to Luas cross-city.  We will look at route realignments over the next week and in the following two weeks.  We will continue to do that.<\/p> <p>  I hope I have explained about the traffic through the area.  The Deputy correctly mentioned that one third of Dublin Bus customers use the area directly.  It is correct to say that not everybody gets off in the area, but everybody who travels through College Green in a bus benefits significantly from the priority it gives.  Some 82 million customers would benefit, but directly approximately 20 million customers benefit every single day from College Green.<\/p> <p>  On the 20% increase, by the end of March this year we will have added approximately 40 buses to our fleet.  All our vehicles are procured by the NTA; we do not fund any of our vehicles.  We have an ideal replacement cycle of replacing a bus every 12 years, given its economic value lifetime cycle.  Therefore, one-12th of our fleet should be replaced every year to be most efficient.  That equates to nearly 100 buses.  Any growth will require extra buses.  Between last year and now we have added about 40 buses to the network.  The NTA funded 102, of which 62 would have been replacement vehicles for older vehicles that went out of the system.  We get significant benefits from them and they show on our customer experience numbers.  The Deputy mentioned Wi-Fi.  We also have USB charging points.  Every bus is wheelchair accessible.  They have Euro 6 standard engines.  Replacing a 16-year old bus with one that meets the Euro 6 standard has a significant impact on the environment.  In addition the vehicles are much nicer inside, which also attracts customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#DD02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne"},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":975,"content":"<p>While I appreciate that, I was just trying to ascertain the additional capacity Dublin Bus has, as opposed to simply replacement buses.

There has been a significant increase in the number of vehicles that have been put into services there.  We have also introduced additional vehicles because as congestion returns, buses are slower in completing their journeys.  Some vehicles are added because of congestion or longer journey times while others are deployed to increase capacity.

As with all things, one plans but one does not know exactly what will happen.  The network that is there today is radically different from what was there previously.  We moved a lot of services during 2011 and 2012.  We also reduced the totality of our network by 20%, which would have had a significant impact on the bus levels going through.  We moved services away from College Green a number of years ago during the construction phase of LCC; they have been permanently moved and no longer exist.  At this stage, we have moved close to 30% of vehicles through the area.  We have moved a significant amount but there may be a requirement to move some more.  We will consider that, if necessary.  It is very difficult to see into the future but we did make a lot of changes.  I would also point out that January and February are traditionally the worst months for congestion in the city.  There will be a natural easing of traffic congestion in the city as we head into March, April and May.  What we have now is the worst of the worst but we have seen significant improvements in recent weeks.  Bus operators plan all of the time and we have moved routes, both before and since the introduction of LCC.  We will move more if we need to and Dublin City Council is making adjustments too.

As a foreigner who is here for the first time, it is a little strange for me to be appearing in the parliament of a foreign country, even though I feel very much at home in Ireland and in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  The first question I was asked was about my views on the extension of the Luas to Finglas and whether there had been any consultations with the NTA on same.  Transdev has been operating here since 2004 and in partnership with various Government bodies has supplied four extensions to the network so far.  All of these extensions have been enormously successful and have widely exceeded passenger number expectations.  If the Government and the NTA decides to go further with plans for new Luas extensions, we will support it as we have always done to date.  At the moment there is no consultation taking place because it is too early in the process.  I would love to see an extension to Finglas but any programme of building new tramways will take some time.  <\/p> <p>  I was also asked about Dublin Bus changes and my colleague from Dublin Bus has already spoken a lot about the process involved.  Since I came here and prior to the opening of LCC, Dublin Bus and Transdev have worked very closely, not only at senior level but also and especially at control room level.  We have had an exchange of operators in an effort to understand each other's problems.  We have built up a lot of personal relationships between staff at Dublin Bus and Luas in recent months and that has created a better situation than would have been the case otherwise.  Regarding the detailed question as to whether we could have a Passenger Information Display, PID, on O'Connell Street directing people to Marlborough Street, I will forward that to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which is the responsible body for that kind of infrastructural implementation.  With the three minute headway we have, which is five minutes off-peak, more people will go over to Marlborough Street to take the Luas.  Today the number of passengers going from St. Stephen's Green to Parnell Street is almost double what we anticipated for this stage of the operation.  A few trams can even be full all the way to Parnell Street or to Upper O'Connell Street.  <\/p> <p>  Senator O'Mahony and Deputy Catherine Murphy asked whether work is ongoing on this.  As my colleague from DCC has said, we are meeting on a regular basis, discussing and going into great detail.  Transdev staff, together with DCC staff are looking at each signal to determine if we can make improvements for all modes of public transport, including taxis.  We are not looking at this only from the perspective of Luas or Dublin Bus but in terms of how to improve the situation for everyone.  We have a common interest in terms of moving commuters as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lahart asked a lot of questions about congestion.  Since the opening of LCC the number of passengers on the green line has increased by 24%, while on the Luas system as a whole we have seen an increase of 16%.  This is evidence of the success of the Luas.  Whatever we put in place in terms of Luas services, it seems it will not meet the demand.  If we increase the number of trams, the demand will be even higher.  As members are aware, we are introducing seven new trams all of which will be in service by the first week in May.  The next step after that would be to extend the existing 26 trams, depending on the political process in this House, to become 55 m trams.  The third step would be to buy another eight trams.  My prediction, however, is that none of that will solve the congestion problems because with all of that will come even higher demand for Luas services, especially with the ongoing development in the Brides Glen area, for example.  I was very pleased when I saw that the Government is planning to introduce a metro system.  The plan that was launched last week included the addition of metro north which will also serve the southern part of the city.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to O'Connell Bridge, which is 40 m long and to our 55 m trams and in that context I can share a snapshot of today with the committee.  No tram, whether 40 m or 55 m long, stopped the cars, when they had the green light, from crossing the bridge.  When the cars had the green light, the trams also had a green light to move out of the yellow box.  Even though the trams are longer, as my colleague from DCC explained, the way the signals are handled is such that the trams are signalled to proceed and get out of the way of the traffic.  Of course, in the context of rush hour traffic, there will be situations where a tram is blocking the traffic but that happens for all modes of transport.  Due to the complexity and intensity of the traffic at rush hour, there will be incidents where some mode of transport will block other modes.  <\/p> <p>  I was also asked if we can extend our hours of operation.<\/p><p>As a private operator, if such a request was made by the NTA, I would immediately change the roster and hire new staff to support it.  The operating hours of Dublin Bus and the Luas are the same and calculated on the needs of service users.  In many countries night services are operated. but in others they are not because it is believed taxis are an adequate alterative during night hours.  <\/p><p> On overcrowding and access to the Luas for wheelchair users at peak hours, I cannot deny that it is a problem.  As a mode of transport the Luas is very popular.  Demand for the service is very high, but it is fully accessible to disabled people.  Where we are notified in advance by wheelchair users of their intention to travel on the Luas, we try to support them, in the first instance by providing them with time slots for when there is less congestion and, second, assistance to enter a tram.  <\/p><p> The issue of Luas travel times through College Green was discussed previously.  My only reflection is that since the service was launched in December 2017, travel times have improved by three to four minutes.  Following completion of the work proposed by Dublin City Council, they will improve further.<\/p><p> Deputy Robert Troy asked for my opinion on having one body with overall responsibility for public transport.  As an operator, I am happy to work with those who have a mandate to make decisions on public transportation.  I have no problem working with TII, the NTA, Dublin Bus or Dublin City Council.  In 2004 there was much conflict between bodies in this area, but today there is a greater understanding of the need for them to work together.  I regularly meet all of the stakeholders to try to solve problems.  For me, what is important is not whether oversight of the area should be the responsibility of one or several bodies but that we solve the problems in order that people can get to work and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#EE00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Lunden-Welden","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":986,"content":"<p>In many of big the cities across Europe there are restricted delivery hours.

While the installation of a traffic monitoring system in the area has been mentioned, I understand legislation is needed to allow for its installation.  There is, therefore, no quality bus corridor to the city centre.  Often three or four buses end up trapped behind each other because a car or other vehicle is parked illegally in the bus lane.<\/p> <p>  On the plan for the College Green plaza, one of the alternative routes proposed by Taxi Alliance Ireland was Anglesea Street to Fleet Street to Westmoreland Street.  If legislation is not introduce soon to regulate rickshaws, taxis will drop passengers off on the plaza where rickshaws will pick them them up.  That is a joke, but the Minister does not appear to be interested in addressing the issue.  People in wheelchairs and others who have trouble in getting around need to be dropped off at the door at their destination.  If no alternative routes are provided for taxis, if a taxi picks up a passenger who wants to go to Fairview, Malahide or Howth, he or she will have drive to Winetavern Street, travel down the quays and across O'Connell Bridge, which is not acceptable.  I have not heard of any alternative today to enable taxis to move around the city.  When the plaza is finished, taxi drivers will be permitted to turn left from Dawson Street onto Nassau Street, but currently if they pick up a passenger on Dawson Street and need to get to Pearse Street, they have to travel via Molesworth Street, South Frederick Street and Nassau Street.

Some 139 million customers benefited from the priority afforded this year and, as I mentioned earlier, there is customer satisfaction of 92% among those 139 million customers.  As part of BusConnects there are next-generation bus corridors.  This is what I was alluding to earlier when I referred to stop lines up to the traffic lights.  QBCs are not a closed system.  There will be significant increases in priority, and QBCs will come through over the next number of years, but what we need is consistency in being able to access the city and keep our journey times consistent.  Deliveries, wherever and whenever they are made, need to be done where they do not impact the customer experience and the reliability of the bus service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne"},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":994,"content":"<p>Deputy Rock wanted to ask one final question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#GG00400","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1519205400,"counter":995,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman for indulging me.  Something occurred to me in the course of the conversation, particularly regarding bus rapid transit and whether or not it might be introduced.  One of the current policies of the council on which we have a lot of correspondence - and I would appreciate it if Mr. Keegan might undertake a commitment to review it - is that in the areas where BRT is currently proposed, whether or not it happens and when it happens being another debate, traffic projects are not getting permission from Dublin City Council to proceed.  I refer to road augmentations and other changes.  In particular I am thinking of Swords Road, Drumcondra Road, etc.  In one instance I have a project on my desk which I think the NTA is willing to fund.  Dublin City Council has been sent this correspondence and the council regularly comes back to me saying it will not contemplate any changes to arrangements on that stretch - this case is on Swords Road specifically - as long as the bus rapid transit plans are still pending.  I would appreciate a review of this approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018022100002#GG00500","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519205400,"counter":996,"content":"<p>We do not want to compromise the potential of bus rapid transit by allowing any development that would be inconsistent with it.
