Ireland's policy of military neutrality is characterised by non-participation in military alliances.  This policy has been underpinned by a set of complementary values which include, inter alia, the protection of human rights; support for development, participation in international peacekeeping operations under UN mandates; and the promotion of disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.<\/p><p>  Partnership for Peace (PfP) is a programme of practical bilateral cooperation between individual Euro-Atlantic partner countries and NATO.  It allows partners to build up an individual relationship with NATO, choosing their own priorities for cooperation. Participation in PfP is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a State selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation in PfP activities.  The PfP programme focuses on defence related cooperation and is designed to help increased stability, diminish threats to peace and build strengthened security relationships.  The principal benefit of our participation is that it has allowed us to enhance the capabilities of Ireland's Defence Forces for peacekeeping, preventative and crisis management operations under UN mandates.  It should be noted that a number of like minded, militarily neutral countries also participate in NATO\/PfP such as Switzerland, Finland and Austria.    <\/p><p>  In relation to EU Battlegroups, again these are not military alliances.  They are a fundamental aspect of the EU's capability to react rapidly to developing crises around the globe.  Battlegroups are made available by Member States to the EU Council and there must be unanimity for their deployment.  Within the EU Battlegroup concept, the purpose of the Battlegroup, as a rapid response capability, includes the role of acting as an initial entry force to stabilise a situation pending the deployment of a follow-on force, to support an established peace support operation which is running into difficulties, similar to the deployment of EU forces in the UN operation in the Congo; and to respond to humanitarian crises.  It should be stressed that any deployment of an Irish contingent in a Battlegroup context would be subject to the requirements of the &quot;triple-lock&quot;.<\/p><p>  In 1999, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace.

Significant progress has been made by the Military Authorities in addressing gaps between male and female participation in the Defence Forces, with an increase of 23% of female participation in the PDF since 2002.  However, it is recognised that more work needs to be done to meet the gender target for recruitment of females of 20% which was set by the Military Authorities in 2007.<\/p><p>  As of 31 October 2013, there are currently 558 women out of a total strength of 9,222 serving in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).  This represents 6% of the overall strength of the Defence Forces and a 23 % increase of female representation in the PDF since 2002.  A key impediment in achieving the target gender balance is the lack of female applicants relative to males.  A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces including:<blockquote>- the introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants, <br \/><br \/>- special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment, <br \/><br \/>- there is balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards.<br \/><br \/>- all promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit,<br \/><br \/>- a Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces.<\/blockquote>  Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties.  Women, therefore,  play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of Defence Forces operations at home and overseas.  The Defence Forces also prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment.  Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks.  The military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner when it arises.<i><\/i><\/p><p>  While Defence Forces policies have been developed to support greater female participation, a key issue in recruiting and retaining female personnel lies in societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers, how such careers are presented through the education and career guidance systems in our schools and colleges, and how society views the role of women in a fully inclusive and equal workplace where all soldiers and officers, irrespective of gender, are required to be available for duties on a 24\/7 basis and are required to serve overseas.  To a large extent, the solution to these societal issues lies outside the Defence Forces.  That said, I believe that there is a need to continue to develop and promote strategies to increase female participation in the Defence Forces.  To this end, I have requested the Chief of Staff to establish a Working Group to examine levels of participation of women in the organisation at all levels.  The data gathered as part of this review will inform current recruitment policies aimed at increasing participation by women in the Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100070#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100070#WRA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[52907\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100070#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will provide a report on the most recent meeting of the European Foreign Affairs Council of defence ministers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The meeting was chaired by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Baroness Catherine Ashton.  NATO Secretary General Mr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen joined the meeting for some working sessions.  On Monday evening, during the first working session, Defence and Foreign Ministers discussed the High Representative's Report on Common Security and Defence Policy and had an exchange of views.  The focus was on agreeing Council Conclusions, which will feed into conclusions on Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) which will be considered by Heads of State and Government at the European Council meeting on 19th and 20th December.<\/p><p>  There was general support for the HR's Report and the associated Council Conclusions, in particular, the emphasis that was placed on a strong and effective Common Security and Defence Policy for the Union.  Ministers agreed that CSDP needs to be reinvigorated and that it is timely for the European Council to engage on CSDP and provide political direction.  On Tuesday morning, Defence Ministers continued their discussion on the upcoming European Council on Defence, in particular, capability development and the defence industry aspects of the Council Conclusions.  Ministers discussed the growing importance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and in this regard, stressed the need for a level playing field to avoid market distortions combined with security of supply.  Other issues discussed included research and innovation, specifically dual use technologies.  There was also broad agreement on the need for increased flexibility, including the modular approach, on the use of EU Battlegroups (EUBGs).  The need for cooperation and non-duplication with NATO, in the area of capability development, was underlined by HR Ashton, SG Rasmussen and by several Member States.  <\/p><p>  In my intervention I welcomed the intention to have security and defence on European Council agenda regularly.  I outlined four issues, which I believe warrant more detailed discussion and endorsement at the European Council meeting.  These include, the use of EU Battlegroups, the reinvigoration of CSDP, the need for the European Council to fully support the ongoing development and maintenance of capabilities, both civil and military, and the need for an efficient and effective defence industry where SMEs can play a full role and which can deliver capabilities, jobs, growth and innovation.   <\/p><p>  Two military operations currently being conducted by the European Union under the Common Security and Defence Policy were also discussed.  These were Operation Atalanta, which is a naval counter-piracy mission off the Horn of Africa, and EU Training Mission Mali, which is training Malian Defence Forces.  <\/p><p>  I also attended the European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board meeting.  The Chief Executive of the EDA briefed Ministers on the EDA's Work Programme for 2014.  This programme identifies many projects and initiatives in areas such as, Communications and Information Systems; Cyber Defence; Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear detection; Counter Improvised Explosive Devices; Maritime Surveillance; Naval Training.  The EDA agreed that they would cooperate closely with the European Commission on research and innovation, particularly in the area of dual use technological developments.  It was also agreed that the EDA would cooperate with the European Commission in areas such as Maritime and Cyber security and energy efficiency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100070#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Missions","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100070#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[52775\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100070#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if, in the wake of the recent violent attack on Irish troops serving in the Golan Heights, he believes that Irish troops are now being viewed as a legitimate target for anti-government rebel attacks; if the attack has changed any security procedures on the ground; and if he will now review his decision to send troops to serve on this mission.","asker":"998","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[52912\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100070#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he has considered withdrawing Irish troops from Syria following the recent firefight in which they were caught up; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The 43rd Infantry Group, comprising 115 personnel, consists of a Force Reserve Company and support elements.  Their role includes the provision of a Quick Reaction Force which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility.  The Irish Infantry Group is also tasked with carrying out patrols and convoy escorts as necessary.  I addressed the question of the incident which occurred on 28 November 2013 involving Defence Forces personnel serving with UNDOF in Syria, in answering a priority PQ earlier. <\/p><p>  Irish troops are deployed to the Golan Heights at a time of increased instability in that region.  That was the situation pertaining in the region when D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann considered this issue last July, when it decided to deploy the contingent to UNDOF.  It was never the case that this deployment was going to be easy.  Both the political and the security situation in the region is volatile; that is why we are there.  Clearly, when we deploy troops to these types of operations, we must also understand and accept that we are putting them in harm's way and that situations, such as the recent attack, can and will happen.  My responsibility, as Minister for Defence, is to ensure that our personnel have the resources, equipment and training necessary to deal with such incidents.  I am glad to say that the personnel of the Irish Force Mobile Reserve are fully trained and equipped with appropriate force protection assets to undertake their important duties on behalf of the United Nations and that they remain fully committed to this task.  The performance of the equipment and personnel in this most recent incident is testament to the standard and quality of the equipment which the Defence Forces have at their disposal and of the commitment and professionalism of our personnel.  <\/p><p>  There are no indications at this time to suggest that the Anti Government Armed Elements see Irish troops as a target.  Given the evolving security situation, the UNDOF mission has continued to reconfigure its operations with a view to ensuring the safety of personnel while continuing to implement the mission's mandate.  All necessary Force Protection measures on the ground continue to be implemented by the Irish contingent.  In addition, ongoing threat assessments are carried out in the mission area and the Chief of Staff continually reviews both personal equipment and force assets, to ensure that those Defence Forces personnel deployed to the mission are appropriately equipped to fulfil their roles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100070#WRA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":26,"content":"<p>Question No. 17 answered with Question No. 11.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":27,"content":"<p>Question No. 18 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100070#WRA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[52881\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100070#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if and when further recruitment to the Defence Forces might be contemplated; the degree to which the strength of each sector continues to be monitored with a view to ensuring optimum strength at all times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department monitors the situation in Gaza closely, including through regular contact with UNRWA and UNOCHA, the main UN agencies active there, as well as relevant Palestinian and Israeli NGOs, some of whom are supported in their work by Irish Aid.  My colleague, Minister of State Joe Costello T.D., witnessed at first hand the very difficult conditions on the ground in Gaza during his recent visit to the occupied Palestinian territory to see the impact of Ireland's aid programme.  He met directly with the UN Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. James Rawley, and others.<\/p><p>  While Israeli restrictions have eased marginally in recent years, the overall situation in Gaza has worsened in recent months as Egypt has taken action against smuggling into Gaza, in response to its own security concerns.  The existing fuel shortfall and shortage of supply of building materials, accentuated by the closure of tunnels, is affecting the daily lives of residents, their electricity supply and water and sewage facilities.  In addition, delivery of construction materials through the crossings from Israel, which had been gradually increased, was suspended again in October following the discovery of a reinforced tunnel dug into Israel from Gaza, with the apparent purpose of facilitating an attack into Israel, perhaps on the soldiers manning the border.<\/p><p>  The power situation is a complex one. Both Israel and Egypt supply electricity to Gaza through the grid system, at commercial rates.  In addition, the Gaza Power Plant supplied about one third of the total available power, using fuel supplied by the Palestinian Authority via Israel, and cheaper fuel smuggled in from Egypt.  Both of these sources have been cut recently, partly because of a dispute in which Hamas has refused to pay for the fuel supplied to Gaza by the Palestinian Authority.  The loss of one third of what was already a marginal power supply has led to increased outages, including to vital water and sewage facilities.<\/p><p>  The loss of construction materials and of power has led to major lay-offs in the construction sector, one of Gaza's few large employers, and thus increased the level of food dependency, which is the principal cause of concern.  More than 800,000 of the over 1.2 million Palestine refugees in Gaza receive food assistance from UNRWA, which also provides basic education, health, relief and social services.<\/p><p>  Ireland has responded to the current crisis by providing additional funding of &euro;500,000 to UNRWA to support the food assistance element of their Gaza Emergency Appeal.  This brings Ireland's total contribution to UNRWA's appeals for Gaza to &euro;4.64 million since 2006.  UNRWA's food assistance provides a lifeline for thousands of refugee families in Gaza and helps to prevent a potentially large scale crisis in a context where an estimated 57% of households are classified as food insecure.  This funding support is in addition to Ireland's broader programme of assistance to the Palestinian people and brings our total funding support to date in 2013 to &euro;8.3 million.  This includes support to UNRWA's general fund, the Palestinian Authority, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and civil society organisations working to promote human rights and democratisation.<\/p><p>  It is clear, however, that humanitarian aid can only seek to ameliorate the difficulties, which will persist until there is a solution at political level. Ireland has therefore continued to draw attention to the urgent need for an end to the overall blockade of Gaza.  We have sought to maintain a focus on this issue, as have organisations such as Amnesty International in their recent report, despite the many other crises in the Middle East at present.  We argue this position consistently in our regular contacts with the Israeli authorities, both in Israel and with the Embassy here in Dublin.  I have raised the matter repeatedly at EU level, to push for the EU to do more to press Israel to end the blockade.  I have made clear before my view that the international community is not doing enough on this issue.  Ireland has also raised Gaza at multilateral level, including in recent weeks interventions at the UN General Assembly in New York and the Human Rights Council in Geneva.<\/p><p>  In the case of Egypt, the sole crossing point at Rafah is not closed, although it is operating at a more restricted level, as a result of the turmoil in Egypt itself.  The main impact has been from Egypt's effective action against the smuggling tunnels, which we cannot take issue with.  However, the loss of the extra supplies formerly obtained through smuggling has highlighted the shortages caused by the overall Israeli blockade regime.  Their interdiction now only underscores the urgent need for the opening to normal traffic of the main crossings from Israel.  I have urged Egypt to allow the widest possible use of Rafah for normal commercial, human and humanitarian traffic.<\/p><p>  Israel is entitled to take measures for the security of its people and borders from attacks which have come from Gaza over a number of years.  Nevertheless, it is clear to me that some measures taken, and the overall regime enforced on Gaza, have a negative impact on the entire civilian population and cannot be justified by security needs.  Whether a particular measure amounts to a prohibited act, such as collective punishment, under international humanitarian law is, however, ultimately a matter for legal determination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100071#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100071#WRB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[53218\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100071#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the proposals he has to extend the embassy and consulate network; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The interest is paid subject to deduction of tax at source at the standard rate of 20% by the authority by virtue of section 246(2) Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The interest is taxable in the hands of the landowner under Case IV of Schedule D (with a credit given for the tax deducted at source) in the year in which it is paid by the authority.<\/p><p>  If the taxpayer were only liable to income tax at the standard rate on his total income in the year in which the interest is paid, the income tax deducted by the authority would be his or her full liability on that interest.  However, if the taxpayer's level of total income were to exceed the standard rate threshold for that year additional tax at the marginal rate of tax would be payable.

However, where tax relief arrangements are of such significance, as in this instance, the removal of the reliefs would represent a fundamental adjustment to the current balance of the tax system and would have very significant implications in terms, among other things, of the economic and behavioural impacts which would ensue.

ARFs are not pension schemes per se.  They are investment options into which the proceeds of certain pension arrangements can be invested on retirement.  Under the &quot;ARF option&quot;, individuals are entitled to take their retirement lump sum and, with the balance of their pension fund, purchase an annuity, invest in an ARF or take the balance in cash subject to tax.  Where the ARF route is chosen, beneficial ownership of the assets in the ARF vests in the individual.<\/p><p>  Electing to invest in an ARF or to receive the balance of a pension fund in cash are subject to conditions.  The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (&quot;specified income&quot;) actually in payment for life at the time the option is exercised.  The Finance Act 2013 provided for a specified income limit of &euro;12,700 per annum.  This was a reduction from the limit provided for in Finance Act 2011 of 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory), which had been a limit of &euro;18,000. <\/p><p>  While any investment income or capital gains arising are exempt from tax while the funds are invested in the ARF, I should point out that sums withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn from an ARF are subject to tax at the individual ARF-owner's marginal income tax rate.  The 2006 Budget and Finance Act introduced an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets in an ARF on 31 December each year, which notional amount is taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate.  This measure was introduced because the internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005 found that the ARF option was largely not being used, as intended, to fund an income stream in retirement but, in certain cases, was being used to build up substantial funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term.  The imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage the use of ARFs, as intended, in the way of actual draw downs being made which are subject to tax.<\/p><p>  The annual imputed distribution of ARF assets was increased from 3% to 5% in Budget and Finance Act 2011 in respect of asset values as at 31 December 2010 and future years.  It was further increased from 5% to 6% for ARFs with asset values in excess of &euro;2 million at 31 December 2012 and future years.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on returns made by Qualifying Fund Managers, the yield from the taxation of the annual imputed distribution of ARF assets for the years 2007 to 2012 is as follows.<\/p><p><b>Yield from the taxation of the annual imputed distribution of ARF assets 2007 &ndash; 2012<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Yield (&euro; million)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2007 (earliest available)<\/td><td>2.75<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>6.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>7.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>10.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>11.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>11.5<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100071#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100072#WRC00075"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[53247\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100072#WRC00100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in the absence of local property tax registered property details being provided, if persons will be subjected to a penalty for delay in payment for failing to register in advance of 27 November; if he will specifically consider the properties (details supplied) which were recently acquired and where the owner has attempted to pay the tax in advance of the deadline as well as register, but their e-mails and telephone calls have been allegedly ignored despite their efforts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The contractual position in respect of SNAs is outlined in their contract of employment.  Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows: Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12\/05 (Post-Primary) - ; and  Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15\/05 (Primary) - .  This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs.  These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time.  <\/p><p>  The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in the standard SNA contract of employment, which was agreed by this Department, the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) representing SNAs and the Management Bodies in 2005.  In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools.  No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc.  These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. <\/p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.  Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment.  Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.  Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement).<\/p><p>  The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:<\/p><p>&quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS Hours<\/p><p>  Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant.  Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited.  Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.<\/p><p>  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013\/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT\/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.

These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.  <\/p><p>The publication of these Guidelines follows a survey of schools by the Department, and which I published in May 2012.  This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme. <\/p><p>  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country.  I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them.  If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents.  Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.  A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year.  <\/p><p>I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level and I believe that these Guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape. <\/p><p>  The Department provided approximately &euro;15m in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012 and the same level of funding was provided in 2013.  The per capita funding provided to recognised primary and post-primary schools within the Free Education Scheme is set out in Circular 46\/2013.  This grant can be utilised for the purposes of a school's book rental scheme.  The Deputy will also be aware from Budget 2014 that additional funding has been provided which will involve an investment of &euro;15m to support the establishment of book rental schemes in primary schools that do not currently operate them.

To qualify for seed capital funding, schools will have to undertake to establish a book rental scheme from September 2014 and in return the Department will commit to the provision of such funding in 2014, 2015 and 2016.

Wicklow from 2007 to 2012 are set out in the following tabular statement.<\/p><p>  As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  In order to achieve economic regional development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  With improvements in infrastructure and investment in one town in a region it has a positive effect on other towns in the region.<\/p><p>  The East Region, which includes Wicklow, has been particularly successful in recent years in terms of attracting inward investment from FDI companies and employing 67,860 people.  At present, there are 17 IDA supported companies in Co. Wicklow employing 2,267 people.  <\/p><p>  IDA Ireland's Strategy for County Carlow within the South East Region is to progress the development of a knowledge economy so that the county, and particularly the county town of Carlow, can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment.  Carlow has traditionally been a centre of manufacturing with a strong engineering tradition in both the indigenous and overseas sectors.  At the end of 2012, there were 7 IDA Ireland supported companies in Co. Carlow employing 576 people. <\/p><p>  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  Among the companies who announced job creation plans or fresh investment plans in recent years for Co. Carlow were: Merck Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme Biologics (Ireland) Ltd, Unum and Merck &amp;amp; Co Inc.  Similarly, for Co. Wicklow were: Nypro and Oriflame.<\/p><p>  Work in winning new investments has been continuing steadily in the second half of 2013 and, on the basis of the trends so far, I am confident that the targets set out for IDA Ireland in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, of winning more than 130 new investments, securing &euro;500m in R&amp;amp;D and creating 13,000 jobs in IDA client companies, will be achieved.<\/p><p><b>Table showing the amount of grants paid in Co.

Following the merger of that company with Schering Plough, the combined operation has excess manufacturing capacity worldwide.  Accordingly, as part of an overall rationalisation, the company has, unfortunately  decided to close the Swords operation by 2017 and transfer production to other factories in the group, located in countries abroad.  <\/p><p>  The gradual shutdown of this plant gives a valuable space to seek a new operation for the factory.  It is not anticipated that any staff will have to leave before mid-2014 at the earliest and that 130 jobs would be lost in the second half of 2014.  The remaining positions would be phased out over the following three years up to the end of 2017.  IDA Ireland will work closely with MSD with a view to identifying a buyer for the factory.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to seek to ensure that this factory can continue as an employer in the area, after the current operation is due to close in 2017. <\/p><p>  Regarding wider job creation in Dublin, I am pleased that the IDA continues to attract impressive levels of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) both in terms of attracting new projects and, also, expansions to existing operations in the capital.  In addition, significant Research, Development and Innovation investments have been secured across a range of sectors, including Financial Services, ICT and Pharma and major Data Centre investments are being undertaken in different parts of the county.<\/p><p>  In terms of wider national FDI, it is also important to remember that Ireland overall continues to be competitive in attracting new investment.  Over 1,000 multinational corporations have chosen Ireland as their strategic European base.  Multinationals currently employ 146,000 people directly and many more indirectly.  In the wider context, as a Government, we have put in place strategies for job creation that are now starting to bear fruit.  The Government will continue to deliver on its commitments in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs<\/i>.  Through the <i>Action Plan for Jobs<\/i> in both 2012 and in 2013 we have addressed a wide range of competitiveness issues which has helped turn the economy around and provide the base for private sector job growth.  We are currently developing an <i>Action Plan for Jobs<\/i> for 2014 which will build on these achievements.  The work of the enterprise agencies will continue to play a huge role in this process.  <\/p><p>  Recent official data has shown that 58,000 jobs have been created in the country over the last 12 months, which is an impressive achievement, in light of the economic difficulties we have faced.  This is the fourth quarter in succession where employment has grown.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 80,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million in 2013. <\/p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme came into effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available.  The rent limits review was completed during the second quarter of this year and used a number of data sources including that of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) which contained details of actual registered rental tenancies.  As outlined by the Deputy, the Daft.ie Q3 2013 rental report records a year on year increase of 4.4% in rents in County Wicklow.  There is no detailed breakdown of this figure by area within the county or by property type. <\/p><p>  There are currently over 2,400 rent supplement recipients in County Wicklow.  Analysis shows that there are properties available within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients in County Wicklow.  It must be stressed that the purpose of the rent limit review was to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas.  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this point has no plans to revise any of the existing rent limits at this time.<\/p><p>  Reliance on rent supplement for those persons with long term housing needs is being addressed with the Department's strategic policy direction to return rent supplement to its original purpose, that of a short term income support.  In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to housing authorities.  Officials in the Department are working with those in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, who are leading the project, in developing the necessary legal, policy and operational requirements to give effect to this transfer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100073#WRDDD02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":186,"content":"<p>Question No. 76 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100073#WRDDD02750"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[53184\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100073#WRDDD02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason rent allowance has ceased in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Meath; if same will be reinstated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the state pension (transition) thereby standardising state pension age for all at 66 years.  The state pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.  These changes apply to all fully insured employees.  Raising State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the difficult fiscal situation.<\/p><p>  Where individuals exit the workforce prior to pension age they may seek the support of either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes. Jobseeker's benefit is a weekly payment to people out of work and covered by social insurance and legislation provides that, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions, a person whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66. On this basis, workers who suffer a substantial loss of employment at age 65 will generally be able to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for the full year to age 66 provided they have paid at least 156 qualifying contributions.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is a substantial support to persons suffering the contingency of involuntary unemployment. Changes to rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context and there are no plans in this regard at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100074#WRD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Data","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100074#WRD00850"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[53278\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100074#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the percentage of applicants refused a social welfare payment who do not go to the Social Welfare Appeals Office; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Transposition of the Third Energy Package, designed to facilitate completion of the internal market in electricity and gas, is a complex process.  The European Commission has issued two Reasoned Opinions to Ireland in regard to its transposition of certain electricity related aspects of the package.  The Commission stated that it wishes in the additional Reasoned Opinion, which issued in late April 2013, to complement the June 2012 Reasoned Opinion, with, inter alia, clarification of its views with regard to the transposition of the unbundling provisions in the Electricity Directive.  My Department, following careful evaluation of the Commission's opinion, replied in September 2013 and will continue to liaise with the Commission on how full compliance is being implemented in Ireland.  The second case relates to a Reasoned Opinion issued on Directive 2009\/28\/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001\/77\/EC and 2003\/30\/EC.  A response to the Reasoned Opinion is currently being prepared and will issue in the coming weeks.  The reply will set out: those articles whose transposition has been notified to the Commission since the Reasoned Opinion; those articles that require legislative amendment; and those articles that my Department considers to have been transposed through a combination of legislation and administrative procedures. Initial draft legislation is being progressed.<\/p><p>  The third case relates to Directive 2009\/31\/EC on the geological storage of carbon dioxide and amending Council Directive 85\/337\/EEC, European Parliament and Council Directives 2000\/60\/EC, 2001\/80\/EC, 2004\/35\/EC, 2006\/12\/EC, 2008\/1\/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1013\/2006.  My Department transposed this in November 2011 exercising a provision under Article 4 of the Directive, not to allow geological storage of CO2 for a period of 5 years as it was considered appropriate to await technological progress and work internationally.  The Commission issued a Reasoned Opinion on 20 November 2013 as they do not consider this approach, which has been adopted by a number of countries, to constitute full transposition and consider that the Directive has only been partially transposed.  My Department is now examining options to finalise transposition of the two articles (12 &amp;amp; 21) that are mentioned in the Reasoned Opinion.  My Department will liaise with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Commission to ensure that a literal translation of the relevant Directive text into an EC Regulation made under the 1972 Act will satisfactorily transpose the Directive.  My Department is looking at early 2014 to notify the Commission of final implementing measures.

This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the National Disability Authority, the Deaf community and other relevant stakeholders with a view to further progressing the implementation of the NDSIP in this regard.<\/p><p>  The meeting reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language including in service provision  and provided the Deaf Community with the opportunity of presenting their experience of dealing with the Public Sector.  It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.  The intention is that outcome of this ongoing process will be reflected in the NDSIP through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and timelines where necessary. Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the Implementation Plan monitoring process.<\/p><p>  The focus therefore remains on the identification of mechanisms for the further promotion and recognition of ISL with a view to promoting and supporting its use, thereby improving service delivery on the ground, rather than on its designation as an official language.

The main acquisitions for 2013 were four tractor units, four 4x4 ambulances, four transit crew cabs, one 52 seater coach, five Ford Ranger 4 x 4 vehicles, twenty transit stores vans and a number of fork-lifts and recovery trailers.  In addition, funding is provided on a continuous basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet. <\/p><p>  With regard to the Naval Service, a contract for the provision of two new ships was placed with Babcock Marine, UK in October, 2010. The first ship to be named LE Samuel Beckett is scheduled for delivery in March 2014; the second will be delivered in early 2015.  This vessel replacement strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level.  The acquisition of these new vessels with the very latest equipment suites will ensure that the Naval Service will be fully equipped to carry out its day to day roles in enforcing the State&rsquo;s sovereign rights over our waters and our fisheries and meeting Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in the area of maritime safety and security and fisheries protection.<\/p><p>  The equipment and aircraft available to the Air Corps are of a high standard and are maintained by the Air Corps in accordance with best practice.  There is no provision for the acquisition of new aircraft for the Air Corps in 2013.  However, a significant level of investment in new equipment for the Air Corps took place in recent years.  The investment programme included the delivery of Pilatus training aircraft, the acquisition of two light utility EC 135 and six utility AW 139 helicopters and a mid life upgrade on the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  Expenditure in the Air Corps for 2013 relates to the maintenance and Power by the Hour contracts set up to keep the fleet operational and to maintenance on the CASA aircraft.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100084#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Strength","counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100085#WRQ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":366,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[53320\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100085#WRQ00200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the total strength of the Defence Forces including reserves, male and female; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":616,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.\u00a0 The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.   \u00a0<\/p><p>  The Irish Government supported the original decision by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) to approve the allocation of EU funding to the Narrow Water bridge project and committed an up-front funding contribution of &euro;3.9 million in January this year. The funding which was to be provided by my Department for the Narrow Water Bridge Project represented a significant commitment given the current financial circumstances. This funding contribution was due to be matched with a contribution from the Northern Ireland\u00a0Executive in line with the agreed funding ratios for the Programme.  The Government was disappointed that the tender process resulted in a doubling of the initial estimated cost budgeted for by the project partners for the construction of the bridge. The Government has indicated on many occasions that it would be willing to help to address the shortfall in funding for the Narrow Water Bridge, but this depended entirely on matching contributions from the other parties, including the Northern Ireland Executive. Also, we could not agree to be solely responsible for any further overruns.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as part of the recovery programme that this Government has had to pursue to put the country back on its feet, unfortunately, there will be a further reduction in regional and local roads spending in 2014 of over &euro;60 million. Ultimately it is from this budget that any additional funding from this State would have had to come and we would not have been in a position to provide a further &euro;10 million towards this project as well as to underwrite any potential further overspend. The estimated figure of a requirement from my Department of &euro;10 million was based on correspondence received from SEUPB and Louth County Council. Given the\u00a0significant difference between the initial estimates and the returned tender prices, the Deputy will\u00a0 appreciate the need to take a conservative approach to the\u00a0funding requests.<\/p><p>  The progression and importance of this project has been discussed\u00a0with my\u00a0government colleagues\u00a0and on a number of occasions\u00a0at the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) most recently on the 8th of November. The priority\u00a0is to avoid\u00a0the loss of\u00a0the EU funding involved. As the Deputy will be aware, members of\u00a0the party that he leads are members of the \u00a0Northern Ireland Executive and of the NSMC\u00a0and\u00a0agreed this position as articulated in the Plenary Joint Communiqu&eacute; that issued following that meeting in particular: &quot;Ministers remain supportive of the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge and have asked for an urgent analysis of the issues involved. \u00a0They remain conscious that the priority is not to lose the EU funding involved.&quot;\u00a0<\/p><p>  It is important to note that there are time constraints with regard to the INTERREG funding. It has to be spent by 2015. SEUPB has since withdrawn the letter of offer and has indicated that it proposes to re-allocate the funding to eligible projects capable of being delivered before the end of\u00a02015. I know that officials in my Department and the Department for Regional Development have identified possible replacement projects, that will benefit cross-border communication\u00a0and economic co-operation in the transport sector and will be working up proposals for consideration by SEUPB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100101#WRGG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Marine Safety","counter":617,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100101#WRGG00950"},{"type":"question","counter":618,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[53279\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121100101#WRGG01000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will publish marine safety notices in the relevant industry publications to ensure that the information is disseminated as widely as possible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":619,"content":"<p>The purpose of a Marine Notice is to notify relevant information to seafarers and mariners and to provide navigational information for maritime traffic, for example in an area where there are activities by vessels carrying out hydrographic or seismic surveys, fishing research or underwater operations.
