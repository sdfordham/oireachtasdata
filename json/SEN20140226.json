Conversely, we had raised the issue, and I had raised the issue, of the potential sale of the IBRC mortgages and also our concerns.  In fairness, as did many people across the House, we had concerns regarding that fact that the sale was not subject to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears should any bidders from abroad be successful.<\/p><p>  I was pleased to see last night's statement from the special liquidators that said, effectively, that the bidders for these mortgages will sign up to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That is a good thing and I acknowledge that.  Such a scenario came about because many people, from all parties and none, raised concerns about the matter.  It is important that such concerns were listened to.  That is good, it is progress and it is better than it was last week.  <\/p><p>  I wish to ask a further question.  I understand from reports, whether correct or not, that the loans will be sold at a significant discount and those in arrears will be sold at a discount of approximately 50%.  I again call for the option to be given to those mortgage holders to purchase restructured mortgages or to allow a restructure of up to the discount amount, even if it is not the full discount amount and I want parameters to be set.  That means if there is a 50% discount then we should allow the mortgage holder to have a restructured mortgage at minus 30%, subject to them meeting certain conditions.  If they do not meet the conditions then the deal is off.  That is something we can look at.  <\/p><p>  I have met people, and people have corresponded with me, in the area where I live who have IBRC mortgages and are very concerned about the CCMA.  That issue has been dealt with and I acknowledge that fact.  That is good.  Let us see if something else can be done prior to the sale with regard to offering those mortgage holders some type of significant restructuring of their mortgage debt.<\/p><p>  Today heralds the start of a process for thousands of homeowners, particularly on the east coast.  The Pyrite Remediation Board has opened and applications for funding can be submitted by individuals to remediate their homes.  This is a very significant day.  I want to acknowledge, as I have done in previous debates, the work done by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department in that regard.  They have done a very good job. <\/p><p>  I have been critical of aspects of the scheme and I do not think that it goes far enough.  During the Committee Stage debate here, the Minister gave a commitment to report every three months and to keep the scheme on review which is a sensible approach.  I have met hundreds of residents in the north Dublin area and, at least, the scheme will act as an avenue for them.  They have been let down by HomeBond, in particular, and by the quarries who do not have to pay a levy towards the fund.  The taxpayer is picking up the tab but the scheme is a start.  I encourage all of the people who have been affected by pyrite, whether they are classed 1, 2 or 3 in terms of damage, to apply to the remediation board at <i>pyriteboard.ie.  <\/i><\/p><p>  Last Thursday in the Customs House a briefing was given by Mr. Noel Carroll and other members of the pyrite board to interested Oireachtas Members that proved very useful.  That is the way things should be done.  A proper briefing means Members can inform their constituents and neighbours on how to apply for the fund.  We will keep the matter under review which is important.  The scheme is a good start and I acknowledge the work done by the Minister and his officials in that regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600003#B00100","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1393410600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien and welcome the announcement that the sale of the IBRC mortgages will be subject to the code of conduct of the Central Bank.  Last week I gave responses as Deputy Leader and thank the Senator for raising the matter last week.  As was announced last night, the fact that the matter was raised by so many Members of the Oireachtas from different parties, both Government and Opposition, was a factor in the decision to ensure that the sale would be subject to the code of conduct.  We all very much welcome that move and it is a real relief for the 13,000 mortgage holders, in particular.<\/p><p>I congratulate Senator Conway and his colleagues on tabling a motion on community courts last night which was accepted by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I hope, as we all do, that we will see a community court set up in Dublin city centre, on a pilot basis, in the very near future.  We had a really good debate and there was strong support for the concept across the House.  It built on the work done by the Oireachtas justice committee and the National Crime Council.  It is welcome to see such a scheme going forward.  It was a sign of the Seanad's strength that it was here that the motion was tabled and agreed to by Government. <\/p><p>I wish to return to the topic that I raised yesterday, namely, the inquiry into the allegations of the Garda whistleblower.  It has been confirmed that Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin, senior counsel, shall conduct a scoping into the dossier or files provided to the Minister.  I welcome the move and wish to say again - and I know that the Minister for Justice and Equality is on his feet in the D&aacute;il now saying the same thing - that we do not rule out a commission of investigation under the 2004 Act being set up subsequently, depending on what Mr. Guerin finds.<\/p><p>It now appears as if the dossier has been known about for some time and there have been a number of internal investigations into same.  All of us should welcome the fact that an independent senior counsel will conduct a review and that it has not been ruled out that we will see a further investigation set up, if necessary.  It is similar to the scoping inquiry carried out in the past by the senior counsel, Mr. Shane Murphy, which led to the establishment of the Morris tribunal and the subsequent very serious findings of Garda misconduct in Donegal.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange another debate on the Constitutional Convention and the inclusion of economic, social and cultural rights, particularly the right to housing.  At yesterday's Cabinet meeting, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, secured approval for a policy to end homelessness - a housing-led policy.  Senator Hayden, and those of us in the Labour Party group, put forward a motion on the matter recently in the House.  The Minister of State has worked on the issue for some time and it is very welcome to see the policy adopted by Cabinet yesterday.  <\/p><p>Recently, at the Constitutional Convention, we approved the idea of a right to housing or a home being inserted into the Constitution.  A huge majority supported the notion.  It would transform the legal framework in which our statutory provisions on homelessness and housing are formulated.  It would be very welcome to see the Government take up the recommendations and move forward with a referendum on the right to a home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600003#B00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1393410600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on hospital services in light of a number of factors.  First and primarily, the report that was discussed this morning on radio by Professor Anne Scott of Dublin City University which is a Europe-wide survey that covered the past 14 years.  It showed that there can be up to a 30% difference in patient mortality depending on the number of nurses assigned to a ward and whether they have university degrees.  The matter should concern us, particularly in Ireland.  A couple of years ago I remember seeing a photograph of the entire class of nursing students, for a particular year, who studied at Galway university boarding a plane for London.  This matter is now a question of life and death.<\/p><p>We ought to look at the other side of the equation that nobody is prepared to mention, namely, patient responsibility.  I spent part of yesterday in St. Vincent's Hospital and I cannot speak highly enough of the private and public medical services available in this country, both of which I and my family have used.  They are splendid in the circumstances.  The noticeboard in the hospital had a notice which stated that there was 27,000 no-shows for appointments in 2012.  That means 27,000 people did not bother to turn up or let the hospital know that they would not arrive.  The hospital has reduced the number of no-shows to 15,000 but 15,000 is too much.  Yes, there are people on waiting lists but 15,000 or 27,000 other people could have been seen.  In addition, the situation in accident and emergency departments at the weekends is a disgrace because they contain people who have dosed themselves with drugs and alcohol.  Such people should be shoved into a padded room and left until they are able to be looked after properly.  <\/p><p>The second matter I wish to raise is the question of Aer Lingus.  I am a strong trade unionist, I am a member of three trade unions and I believe in the trade union movement.  I understand and acknowledge the serious worry of people, as they get older, concerning their pensions but we need consistency and integrity.  I find it profoundly shocking that SIPTU has called on its members to strike on St. Patrick's weekend.  I understand pressure points and all of the rest of it but put in the context of the fact that SIPTU is taking exactly the same action against its own workers with regard to pensions and pension cuts, it has completely undermined its moral case.  The House should seek an explanation from SIPTU on its position.      <\/p><p>I always like to end on a bit of good news so let us hear it for the northside of Dublin.  They are wonderful people.

A more proactive approach should be taken to ensure that if people cannot turn up for appointments that hospital authorities are notified.<\/p><p>I wish to raise an issue that has arisen in the north side of Cork city, that is, the amalgamation and reconfiguration of four schools.

These are the fishermen who go out in small boats of 18 ft. to 22 ft.  For most of the past four months, given the appalling weather conditions, storms, huge tides and waves, they have been unable to fish.  They depend on the weather for a window of opportunity.  They are classified as self-employed.  I met a met a group of the fishermen last Sunday, most of whom find it almost impossible to put bread on the table for their families.  As they are classified as self-employed, I suggest they seek fish assist from the social welfare office.  Having asked officials from the Department of Social Protection about this scheme, I do not think it has ever been utilised.  These men were shrimp fishing, lobster fishing, crab fishing, scallop dredging and gillnetting for pollock, which is seasonal.  There are 120 to 130 such fishermen in my constituency and many around the country who are not represented and are not in any association.  <\/p><p>I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, to intervene with the Minister for Social Protection, to ensure in the event of severe storms, when it is obvious the fishermen cannot go out to sea, a mechanism is put in place whereby they can short-circuit the system to get social welfare.  At the social welfare office they are told, as they are self-employed, to come back in 12 months time with their account and to prepare a report.  It is a crazy system and I am aware it is a system the Minister inherited.  I raised the issue about ten years ago when my party was in government.  Almost 12 months ago, in April or May 2013, the Leader gave a commitment for a debate on the fishing industry.  I am aware we have had a debate on farming but a debate on the fishing industry generally is well over due.  I will not push for a vote on it today but if, in the next couple of weeks, I do not have a commitment from the Minister to come to the House on these issues I will certainly seek to table an amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600004#C00700","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1393411200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Senator David Norris for his comments.

I will give a brief account of a personal story.  In 2006, at the height of the Celtic tiger, my daughter was unfortunate enough to break both of her wrists and for a number of months was in casts.  Eventually she received an appointment to go to Crumlin hospital to have them removed.  We duly attended.  There were 300 patients before us.  Eventually she was seen and the casts were removed.  When I arrived home that day there was a letter from Crumlin hospital advising me not to turn up for my appointment as it had been postponed for a week.  I received another letter to say the appointment was postponed for yet another week.  I waited because I was curious to see how many letters I would receive before the administration of that hospital realised that my daughter's casts had already been removed.  It is a bit glib to blame ordinary people for sometimes very serious deficits in administration in our hospital systems.  <\/p><p>I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on getting approval from Cabinet for a strategy on homelessness.  Some 84% of those at the Constitutional Convention last weekend voted for the inclusion in the Constitution of a right to a home.  I am sure we are all in the same position.  I have people calling to me day after day because their rent supplement is not sufficient for them to afford somewhere to live and they are moving into homeless services.  I ask the Leader for a debate - perhaps two, the first on how to implement the right to a home in current circumstances and, second, to ask the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to address us on the emergency situation in rent supplement and how she plans to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600004#C00800","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1393411200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will follow through on the calls for a debate on the health service, nurses and patients.  I was chairman of a hospital on one occasion and tried to have the patients called customers.  The more we can remind hospitals and the health service that the patients are actually customers, the better.  The issue that bothered me about patients not turning up was the tradition of calling everybody at the same time.  In other words, if the consultant was coming in from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. he told everybody to come at 3 p.m. which resulted in a large number of people arriving at the same time.  The administration of the health service will have to change in some form or other.  It has changed a great deal and people are now given ten or 15 minute slots.  That people do not turn up for their appointment is extremely frustrating for the hospital administrators.

However, I have a concern, which I have mentioned on many occasions here, that the code of conduct is not worth the paper it is written on.  In practice, organisations, particularly those that are withdrawing from the Irish market, are forcing borrowers into repossession or voluntary sale situations.  I had a case yesterday in which a family farm of 100 acres, which had been in one family for generations and was probably worth in the region of &euro;1 million, was being forced to be sold to repay borrowings of &euro;480,000.  That is fundamentally wrong.  It is not necessary, but it is the quickest way for the bank, which is leaving the Irish market, to extract its funding from it.  That is not the spirit in which the code of conduct was established.  It is not the way business should be done.  The fact is that the fox remains in charge of the henhouse.  Is it any wonder that they would openly sign up to this?<\/p><p>In another case, in which I myself was the mediator between the borrower and a sub-prime lender, I went several times to the lender to ask for a mortgage-to-rent arrangement, which it trumpeted as a solution that it was offering to customers.

At present, there is an <i>ad hoc<\/i> service, but under the new Bill, such children will be afforded a statutory right to a care plan.  We all will be aware of the suffering and anguish that many parents face when they do not know what will happen to their child, who perhaps has been in care all of his or her life through one need or another and is not able to cater for himself or herself.  This will put many minds at rest with the assurance that there will be a statutory care plan.  I am not saying there is no plan for children when they reach the age of 18 - more than 1,000 children were facilitated last year - but the ease and peace of mind that putting it on a statutory basis with the family agency will give to parents must be welcome.<\/p><p>  In talking about scams, we all heard about the Bank of Ireland scam in Kilkenny and where else, but I want to bring to attention today a scam that is waiting to happen.  A website is offering Garth Brooks tickets for sale.  I heard that a quarter of the population was going to these concerts, but the tickets, which cost &euro;65, are sold out.  People should be wary of buying tickets online because they are now going for up to &euro;800.

The Grant Thornton report, which is a good report that sets out clearly the challenges faced by the post office sector, also makes a number of recommendations, many of which my party would support.  It is important that we hold a debate in this House as well as the debate in the D&aacute;il, because I am sure Members, especially those of us who live in rural areas, have much to contribute on the importance of post offices.  The Leader will be aware that in his constituency there were post office closures in a number of villages.

When the post office is lost, it has a big impact on those who live in rural areas, including older people.<\/p><p>The big issue seems to be the contract with the Department of Social Protection for social welfare payments.  It is important that the contract be protected and in my view, An Post should get the contract for it.

It commissioned a report approximately 19 months ago on what occurred on that dreadful day in 1998 when so many lost their lives as a result of the Real IRA's bombing of Omagh town centre.  The group has requested a meeting with the Taoiseach numerous times, which to date has been refused despite the Taoiseach's public utterances to the contrary on live television.  However, he has not lived up to the commitments he has given in this regard.<\/p><p>The second issue concerns the report that was provided to the Minister for Justice and Equality on 19 July 2012 and to which he has not even responded.  Answers from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality are required, as well as a clear commitment to engage in a public inquiry into the atrocity of 1998.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate in this House in the presence of the Taoiseach.  While another debate could be held in the presence of the Minister for Justice and Equality on a separate occasion, the Taoiseach certainly should be called before this House to answer some valid questions from the families of those who lost loved ones on that dreadful day.  The Leader should see to this, as this House could play a meaningful role in this regard.<\/p><p>The second issue I wish to raise concerns the new building regulations that come into effect next Saturday, 1 March.  Effectively, this means that only registered contractors can build new houses, which means those who wish to self-build will be precluded from so doing and on average, it will push up the costs of building a home by at least 25%.  This is unrealistic, people cannot afford it, the banks are not lending money and it also will have an impact on the property market.  While these regulations are due to come into effect on Saturday, there has been little or no discussion in respect of them.

Since 1999, various European Union directives have set common rules on distance-related tolls and time-based user charges for heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain road infrastructure.  It is open to any member state to introduce road user charges if it wishes and the road user levy, which is being introduced by the United Kingdom's Parliament, applies to all heavy goods vehicles weighing 12 tonnes or more for the use of United Kingdom roads, including those in Northern Ireland.  This levy is due to come into effect on 1 April 2014.<\/p><p>The reason I seek the passage of a motion or for Members to write to Mr. Hammond is this measure will have serious implications, particularly around Border regions, in respect of haulage companies, which are struggling to make ends meet.

However, to me it brings to mind the launch by the Government in November 2012, to great pomp and with great style, of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, which the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is leading.  When I saw the aforementioned newspaper report, I decided to check to ascertain what is being done by CEDRA.  I could not find much information on its website, which contained a schedule of meetings for 2013 but none for 2014.  It appears as though the notes, minutes and notifications for the last meeting was for 19 November 2012.  At the time, press statements indicated that the report of CEDRA was due in October 2013.<\/p><p>  I seek information on the current status of CEDRA, which is headed up by Pat Spillane?  Have they all emigrated?  Are those who were updating the website now unemployed?  What is the position with CEDRA, because it appears as though there is no coherent policy on rural development in the Government's plans?  In fairness, there was not much of a coherent plan before that either but it is of huge importance for people living in the west and the north west to have in place a proper economic development plan for rural areas.  One was told that CEDRA would go some way towards sorting this out and consequently, I seek a debate on the CEDRA initiative.  What actually is happening in this regard and is it going anywhere?  While I am sure it is possible that much work has been done behind the scenes, I seek a debate on its future direction, on what is the Government's plan and whether it has a strategy on rural areas, as opposed to merely having big press launches and setting up websites only for very little to happen thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600006#E01700","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1393412400,"counter":72,"content":"<p>On a point of order-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600006#E01800","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1393412400,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Senator Norris, on a point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600006#E01900","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1393412400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>----- could the Leader or the Cathaoirleach ask Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh whether he can clarify-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600006#E02000","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1393412400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Senator, we are on the Order of Business.

Several people have spoken to me about the work they are doing in this regard and it would be a welcome debate, because they have been working.  The Leader might be able to find an opportunity to include a debate on rural development.<\/p><p>I wish to raise the issue of the meat found by the Polish inspectors last year at the time of the horsemeat scandal.  It is impossible to think otherwise but that this report is highly disturbing.  It is not sufficient for anyone to suggest the Poles would say that anyway or that they came to Ireland to inspect our plants merely in order to state it had nothing to do with Poland.  On coming here, they found a variety of highly disturbing things, not least of which were the boxes some people will have seen in the newspapers.  Those photographs show clearly meat of mixed origin, some of which was very old and very rotten.  It appears in this case that it was the horsemeat that was added to this old meat to disguise the latter.  In fact, this was not horsemeat mixed with beef but was old, disgusting rotten meat that had horsemeat added to it to make a better.  This appears to be what happened.  That therefore is what is called in the trade category three animal by-product meat, which should not be used for human consumption and the clear suggestion is that this possibly was there to be used for consumption by humans.<\/p> <p>It is not enough to say we are satisfied it was not going to be used for human consumption if there were 22 pallets of it, which is quite a lot.  They are large boxes of frozen meat.  Like myself, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has only one thing at heart which is to protect the Irish beef industry, to ensure its integrity and to offer assurance to farmers that their efforts and hard work are being rewarded with an industry that is properly policed.  <\/p><p>We need to know the answer to a couple of questions.  When the Polish inspectors came to Ireland last year, they would not have been allowed into Irish plants without being accompanied by people from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  I am sure those people who accompanied the Polish inspectors have a report to make, took photographs and have something to say about what happened.  <\/p><p>It is not enough to say we have no jurisdiction over rotten meat once it arrives in Ireland.  If a box of meat was filled with rats, we would be very quick to say this is not appropriate and is not suitable.  We would deem it inappropriate and would have something to say about it.  Clearly, we ought to have something to say about this meat.  It is clear the labels were false, were photocopied or were old ones which were reused.  This impinges on the business here and I would very much appreciate it if the Minister came to the House to explain exactly what happened when the Polish inspectors found these boxes of meat which clearly were not suitable for human consumption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600006#E02700","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393413000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I support fully what Senator O'Neill said.  I also support my colleague Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, who raised this matter on the Adjournment last week.  As Senator O'Neill said, the HGV Road User Levy Act comes into effect on 1 April.  This means lorries travelling from the Republic to Northern Ireland or to the United Kingdom will have to pay &pound;10 per day, which is totally unacceptable.  I agree with Senators O'Neill and &Oacute; Domhnaill that to exempt a particular road or to say a seven-mile radius of the Border will be exempt is not good enough.  This will have serious consequences for members of the Irish Road Haulage Association.  It is already &euro;5,200 cheaper to operate the same type of vehicle in the North than it is here.  This levy will create further hardship for these people who are already struggling to make a living.  I agree with my colleagues that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, must contact his counterpart in the Northern Ireland Assembly as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>I am surprised by the deafening silence of Sinn F&eacute;in in this regard.

That is a difference of nine percentage points in the level of obesity.  A further 10% of children in the intervention schools were overweight, compared to 16% in other schools.  It is quite obvious that in schools that are making an effort to tackle obesity, the results are very positive.  The Minister of State with responsibility for primary health care, Deputy Alex White, said the findings were very positive and should be considered by Government.  Could we have a debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, or the Minister for Education and Skills on how we can ensure all primary and secondary schools take the issue of obesity seriously and on measures we can put in place in schools to tackle this problem, which is causing so many health issues and problems for young people and is adding huge costs to the overall health bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600007#F00300","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1393413000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Senator Darragh O'Brien raised the question of the IBRC mortgages and welcomed the fact that all bidders will sign up to the Central Bank of Ireland's code of conduct, while Senator MacSharry said the code of conduct is not worth the paper it is written on.

The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is very supportive of them and I hope we will see action in early course.  Senators Bacik and Hayden referred to the Constitutional Convention's findings on housing and homelessness.  As I said previously, Mr. Tom Arnold will come to the House to discuss the final report of the Constitutional Convention but in the meantime, as Senator Hayden asked, I will invite the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, back to the House to address this point.  She was here not so long ago for a debate on homelessness.  There was also a call for the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, to come to the House to debate rent supplement.<\/p><p>Senator Norris raised the issue of hospital services and I note his point about the study on nurses.  The point he raised about people who do not attend appointments is one I have raised on several occasions with the Minister for Health.  There should be a national campaign to advise people that they should turn up.  Admittedly situations can arise, such as those Senator Hayden mentioned, where there are some problems with administration in the hospital, but 27,000 people did not turn up to St. Vincent's Hospital in 2012, which meant that 27,000 who did not get an appointment could have had one.  That should be highlighted on a national basis.  Many hospitals give a second appointment, and if people do not turn up for that one they are put at the bottom of the list, but they should probably be removed from it.  If there is a change of address, the GP or the patient should notify the hospital and the consultants.  That is what is happening in some instances, but something will have to be done because we will never get rid of waiting lists if people do not turn up for appointments.<\/p><p>I also note Senator Norris's point on SIPTU.  I admire and pay tribute to the people on the north side of Dublin, which the Senator normally does, and rightly so.  <\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke referred to the amalgamation of schools in Cork city, which the Cathaoirleach said was possibly a matter for the Adjournment debate.  The Senator mentioned that there had been no consultation with parents and boards of management, but I thought that day had gone.

I presume that is because the GPs are in Buswells Hotel from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. today.<\/p> <p>Some Members have already gone there and are making the case in the House.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, is available for negotiations with the GPs.<\/p><p>Senator Denis O'Donovan called for a debate on fisheries.  I have asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House to discuss the matter and I will renew those representations.  With regard to the call for some mechanism to activate the fish assist scheme, I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  Senator Paul Coghlan and Senator Marc MacSharry referred to the IBRC loan book, which I have commented on.  Senator Keane advised people to beware of purchasing tickets on the Internet for concerts, referring specifically to the Garth Brooks concert.  People should be advised of this in respect of scams on the Internet.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane referred to the post office network, a matter raised yesterday.  I gave a comprehensive reply on it and it was also the subject of an Adjournment debate yesterday evening during which the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, gave a comprehensive report on the issue.  Yesterday I mentioned that over the past three years we have had 17 closures of post offices while in the previous three years 197 post offices were closed.  The Senator should look at what was mentioned yesterday in the House and on the Adjournment debate.<\/p><p>Senator Healy Eames raised a point but is not present in the Chamber for the reply.  In the Adjournment debate she has requested for this evening, she will receive a reply.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the Omagh support and self-help group, which had a comprehensive meeting with the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Taoiseach, as requested.<\/p><p>Senator Pat O'Neill referred to the road user levy in Northern Ireland.  It was first raised by Senator Terry Brennan and in an Adjournment debate by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and others.

I welcome the head of marketing for Waterways Ireland, Mr. &Eacute;anna Rowe, who is in the Gallery this morning.  As Senators know, Waterways Ireland was established in 1999 under the British-Irish Agreement Act and is charged with the management, maintenance, development and restoration of Ireland's inland waterways, principally for recreation purposes.  In total, Waterways Ireland manages some 1,000 km of waterway on both sides of the Border, including the Shannon navigation, the Erne system, the Lower Bann, the Royal and Grand canals, the Barrow navigation and the Shannon-Erne waterway, which this year celebrates 20 years since it was restored to navigation in 1994.<\/p> <p>Since its establishment Waterways Ireland has restored the Royal Canal to navigation; opened up new cruising destinations such as Boyle and Ballinasloe; developed integrated recreational facilities at numerous locations such as Lough Key, Enniskillen, Clondra, Killaloe, Clashganny, Shannon Harbour, Enfield and Mullingar; doubled the mooring capacity on the waterways; developed a necklace of recreational services all along the waterways; placed the waterways at the centre of the tourism offering both nationally and internationally; and formulated and implemented numerous community and activity support programmes including its hugely successful sponsorship programme, its education outreach programme and its archive facility.<\/p><p> In fact, one of my first official engagements following my appointment as Minister was to officially open the wonderful new marina, service block and looped walk developed by Waterways Ireland in Killaloe.  I witnessed at first hand that July morning in 2011 not only the fine facilities but the dynamic and active engagement between Waterways Ireland and the community of Killaloe-Ballina.  I know that this deep and lasting partnership continues to flourish and was delighted to hear that Waterways Ireland is supporting and talking an active role in this year's millennium celebration of Brian Boru in Killaloe.<\/p><p> The benefits accruing from Ireland's inland waterways are many and varied.  The waterways provide a direct as well as an indirect economic benefit.  They sustain employment and they provide a social benefit as well as providing health and well-being benefits.  The inland waterways support local communities, the growing recreation industry and the tourism sector as well as the local and national economies.  In fact, many of the inland waterways travel through some of the most disadvantaged areas both rural and urban on the island of Ireland.  The waterways are, in many instances, the only economic driver in those areas.<\/p><p> This year my Department will provide more than &euro;24 million to Waterways Ireland and I know the economic benefit accruing from this investment is significant.  Since its establishment in 1999, the number of boats registered with Waterways Ireland has increased by more than 50% to some 14,000 craft.  Waterways Ireland, in research undertaken into the private boating sector, estimates that the sector is worth between &euro;80 million and &euro;100 million per annum to the national economy.  In a separate study undertaken by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Waterways Ireland into the cruise hire sector it is estimated that the sector contributes between &euro;15 million and &euro;20 million per annum.  Waterways Ireland also supports myriad local, national and international events along the waterways and the 90 plus events supported in 2013 led to an economic boost of more than &euro;8 million to the local economies.  Waterways Ireland is planning further research later this year which will further quantify the economic and social dividend from the inland waterways.<\/p><p> There is no doubt also that the indirect benefits from waterway activity also contribute to the local fabric of the communities through which the waterways flow.  In recent years there has been a significant growth in the number of activity centres, sail schools, canoe centres, walking and cycling offerings as well as angling hubs being established on the back of the capital and infrastructural development undertaken by Waterways Ireland.  For example, following the development of an integrated harbour and service development in the small rural village of Clondra in County Longford on the Royal Canal by Waterways Ireland the village has witnessed the opening of a cruise hire base, a canoe school and a walking tour operator.  Not alone that, but the community has witnessed and participates in these developments and has embraced the very positive change which the new harbour has brought to the village.  This is evidenced through community engagement, voluntary participation and collective effort in all areas of the social fabric of Clondra.<\/p><p> Furthermore, while the waterways in question support a thriving boating and cruising sector, support and contribute to communities and contribute to the local and national economies in a significant way, the waterways also provide easily accessible, safe and welcoming leisure opportunities.  The health and well-being benefits accruing to society from such leisure activities are many and varied, and the cycling and walking opportunities in particular and the general outdoor recreational environment provided by Waterways Ireland contribute in a very meaningful way to the welfare of society as a whole.<\/p><p> In order to maximise the economic and social benefits as described, Waterways Ireland continues to develop and promote the waterways and associated waterway activities.  It continues to deepen and strengthen partnerships with other recreation and tourism agencies, its stakeholders and with the private sector.  To that end Waterways Ireland continues to plan in a very strategic way the long-term development and promotion of the waterways in partnership with relevant local authorities, national tourism agencies, and the rural partnership companies as well as activity and accommodation providers through the formulation of product identification studies on the 1,000 km of waterways managed by Waterways Ireland.<\/p><p> Waterways Ireland has recently formulated a Draft Corporate Plan 2014-2016, which provides a strategic planning framework to guide Waterways Ireland's work programmes over the next three years.  Waterways Ireland is carrying out a public consultation on its draft corporate plan until 31 March 2014.  Central to its vision for the future is the development of recreational, heritage and environmental opportunities that link people, history and nature, providing both local communities and visitors with compelling reasons to spend more time in the waterways environment.  It recognises that the inland waterways are an intrinsic part of our past and future.  They are at the heart of community life, yet they also provide important regeneration opportunities to transform and create vibrant prosperous communities.<\/p><p> Waterways Ireland is the custodian of a valuable infrastructure built up over many years.  One of its duties is to protect that infrastructure from risks that arise from time to time and in that context I would like to take this opportunity to address the issue of the <i>Naomh &Eacute;anna<\/i>.  This vessel was purchased by the Irish Nautical Trust and moored at Grand Canal Dock in 1989, when it could no longer meet health and safety requirements to operate as a passenger-carrying vessel.  Unfortunately, the ship has deteriorated substantially in the past 20 years and presents a real risk in the Grand Canal Basin in the heart of Dublin's docklands.  In April 2013, a report commissioned by its owners on the hull condition of the vessel highlighted serious safety concerns.  Based on the report's findings, the trust issued a notice to vacate to both of the businesses that had been operating from the vessel.  Very significant investment would be required to preserve the already unstable hull of the vessel and to bring the vessel to the point where it would be safe and insurable.  The ship's owners do not have access to finance on the scale required, nor is there any realistic prospect that such finance can be found.  In the circumstances, Waterways Ireland offered to arrange for the removal and disposal of the ship on behalf of its owners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600009#H00300","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393414500,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Could the Minister tell us who are the owners?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600010#J00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1393414500,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Waterways Ireland made this offer as the property owners of the Grand Canal Dock because of the continuing serious risk posed by the condition of the <i>Naomh &Eacute;anna<\/i>, the disruption and expense that would be involved were it to sink in the Grand Canal Dock and the absence of any firm indication that the very significant level of finance required to make it safe and insurable was potentially available.  The Irish Nautical Trust accepted the offer and confirmed its approval to Waterways Ireland to dispose of the vessel on its behalf.  The vessel's condition does not support its movement out of the dock.  Accordingly, Waterways Ireland has recently moved the <i>Naomh &Eacute;anna<\/i> to an adjacent dry dock, under a short-term licence agreement with NAMA, from where it will be dismantled under contract.  I am advised by Waterways Ireland that this is the only practical way of ensuring the vessel does not sink in the main dock, thereby giving rise to considerable additional expense.  Let me assure this House that the decision has not been taken lightly.  Rather, it is because of the continuing serious risk posed by the vessel, the disruption and expense that would be involved were it to sink in the Grand Canal Dock and the very considerable expense that would be involved in making it safe and insurable.<\/p><p>  Waterways Ireland is also obliged to manage the canals and in that regard, it is preparing new by-laws for consideration.  It recently concluded a public consultation on its proposed revision of the by-laws.  I am aware there has been much debate and discussion around this topic.  I would like to take this opportunity to clarify some issues around this subject.  First, the proposed changes to the by-laws are required to allow Waterways Ireland to proactively manage the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal as well as the Barrow Navigation.  With approximately 500 boats on the three systems, Waterways Ireland is seeking to encourage more visiting boats onto the three waterways.  However, it is evident to Waterways Ireland that the movement of boats on the waterways in question is problematic under the existing by-law regime.  Mooring spaces at many harbours are difficult to access due to continuous harbour hogging.  Neither the Royal Canal nor the Grand Canal, nor indeed the Barrow Navigation, has private marinas and there has been a slow but steady increase of unregulated houseboats in certain locations on the waterways.<\/p><p>  In an effort to bring additional visiting boats on to the systems, Waterways Ireland is proposing the introduction of a free 30 day visitor cruising permit; the introduction of a range of fees for fixed mooring permits - in the absence of private marinas; the regulation of houseboat moorings; and the introduction of a fixed payment notice for those boats in breach of the by-laws.<\/p> <p>These new by-laws will enhance Waterways Ireland's ability to manage the canals and waterway amenities.  The proposed changes will also support the investment already made in new infrastructure and facilities by Waterways Ireland and will help to develop the canals as a vibrant recreational waterway for all users.<\/p><p>It is almost a quarter of a century since the by-laws were updated and I am sure Members would all agree that much has changed in the past 25 years.  The same is true for the three waterways in question.  In that time they have witnessed considerable investment.  The Royal Canal was restored to navigation, new and improved facilities have been provided all along the three waterways and service blocks with toilets, showers and laundries have been developed at strategic locations.  In all, Waterways Ireland has invested on behalf of the taxpayer over &euro;50 million in the infrastructure of the Royal and Grand Canals and Barrow Navigation.<\/p><p>At the same time, Waterways Ireland has continued to market and promote these beautiful waterways.  It has supported numerous events and activities on and adjacent to the water and continues to work in partnership with local authorities, tourism agencies and activity and accommodation providers along the three waterways.  For example, in 2013 Waterways Ireland supported TriAthy, &Eacute;igse Carlow, the all-Ireland coarse angling championships in Edenderry, Phizzfest in Phibsboro, the Docklands summer festival here in Dublin City and the canoe polo championships in Enfield to name but a few.  In fact in conjunction with Ingenious Ireland, Waterways Ireland developed a mobile APP and audio guide to the Barrow and its corridor last year.  At the same time, Waterways Ireland, in partnership with Westmeath County Council, has developed a greenway cycle route along the Royal Canal and continues to work and support the further development of that greenway in Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Longford.  These are but some of the many initiatives, supports, developments and investments made by Waterways Ireland in the Royal Canal, Grand Canal and Barrow River.<\/p><p>I am sure Members will agree that our Inland Waterways are a wonderful, natural heritage, leisure, recreation, boating and tourism attraction.  They provide an insight into times past, allow access to a rich and diverse natural heritage, sustain many local businesses and communities and support a myriad of leisure and tourism opportunities, both for the domestic and international tourist.  I am sure they will also agree that Waterways Ireland has indeed achieved much in developing, promoting and managing the 1,000 km of waterways since it was established.<\/p><p>I wish to acknowledge that the organisation, like all public bodies, faces many challenges in the coming years, but I wish to reassure the House that Waterways Ireland, with my support and that of my Department, will continue to successfully develop and promote these magnificent natural assets on behalf of all the people of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600010#J00300","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393415100,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister enthusiastically because I am aware of the energy and commitment he puts into these matters.  Both he and Waterways Ireland must be congratulated on their work and it is appropriate to record achievements such as opening up the Grand and Royal Canals in the House.  However, there is the issue of maintenance and I am not sure this is always properly done.<\/p><p>  This House is charged with scrupulously examining proposals and many questions arise from the Minister's statement and from briefings I have had from various sources.  I am glad the Minister raised the question of the <i>Naomh &Eacute;anna<\/i>.  I am not sure he would have raised it spontaneously, but I raised this issue yesterday because I am concerned about it, particularly because they have already started removing the brass portholes from the boat.  I understand the Minister may be concerned that we have other boats, like the <i>Jeanie Johnston<\/i> and the <i>Dunbrody,<\/i> but these were replicas and cost an enormous amount of money.  The <i>Naomh &Eacute;anna<\/i> is not a replica.  It is an historic boat about which a programme was broadcast on Radio 1 in the past couple of weeks.  It is a fully riveted unique boat of Irish construction.  I agree it would cost some money to restore it, but it might then generate money as a tourist attraction.  For example, it might be brought back to Galway and made into an attraction there.<\/p><p>  I appeal to the Minister to stop the dismantling taking place currently and to ensure, at the least, that it can be reversed.  A group which has previously been successfully involved in restorations of this kind wants a six-month moratorium on this so that it can get the finance to carry out a restoration.  Will the Minister please provide an opportunity for this historic boat to be restored?  We do not have the full original <i>Asgard.<\/i>  We have absolutely nothing fully original.  The two 18th century sailing ships are very interesting and I have enjoyed being on both of them, but they are not originals.<\/p><p>  I agree there must be some regulation of houseboats and people should pay for services if they get them.  If they get bin collections, water and electricity, these should be paid for.  However, how can they go from a minor charge or no charge to a charge of &euro;3,500?  That is madness, as with many of the new proposed regulations.  I agree Waterways Ireland has done wonderful work.  I am not sure who the gentleman is who is charge of this, but he is in the Visitors Gallery.  Perhaps he is the man I am smiling at.  Well done to him on the work, but he should beware of killing the golden goose.  If these charges are raised suddenly to the extent proposed, they will frighten people off from using our waterways.  The majority of people who use the canals and waterways are not wealthy people.  They are not the kind of people who have yachts worth &euro;1 billion in Monte Carlo and elsewhere.  They are ordinary people and include former Members of this House.  I know, for instance, that Joe O'Toole used to talk about buzzing up and down the Shannon on his little boat.  He was probably one of the wealthier people with a boat, because he had a guaranteed income here.  We need to be very careful and to give serious consideration to the situation.<\/p><p>  I have received correspondence from boat owners and they make the point that the new levy of &euro;3,500 will be prohibitive.  Do we want to kill off our own people from using our waterways?  The proposed cruising permit will require boaters to move their boats every five days.  Why should people be asked to move along every five days?  I am not good at arithmetic, but how many five-days are there in a year?  It is in or about 60.  Therefore people will have to move on 60 times or more in a year.  We have Travellers on land, but now the Minister is trying to create Travellers on the canals as well.  This is absolutely mad.  If people do not move, they will be fined &euro;150 or will have to pay a mooring fee of &euro;2,500.  <\/p><p>  We do not have proper moorings in many places.  I would like the Minister to send his inspectors to examine the places where these people are supposed to moor.  They do not exist.  The facilities are not provided in these places, so why should they pay this outrageous amount of money for being told they must move along every five days?  They may have to move on to a place that is just a kind of gap in the bank.  It is not a marina and no facilities are provided, so why should they be charged?  There is no provision either for winter mooring.  One only needs to go to D&uacute;n Laoghaire to see what should be available.  There, many boats are laid up for the winter and the keels are scraped and the boats are repainted and so on.  Why should people be charged for boats that are laid up for the winter and must they move what may be a half-painted boat every five days?  These are significant issues.<\/p><p>  I have a letter from the New Ross boat club in which it is stated that there are very few safe places to leave a boat, apart from St. Mullins, Graiguenamanagh and Vicarstown and that there are no private marinas on the Shannon.  Therefore, the five-day rule will put genuine boating people off using the waterways.  The canals were built for barges and have attracted heritage barges.  A barge like that is great.<\/p> <p>It is even lovely for those like me who may not be a waterways enthusiast.  They will also be in trouble.<\/p><p>The maddest example of all concerns the two-week Dublin waterways rally.  Under the proposed by-laws, many of the groups concerned which have voluntarily supported the work of Waterways Ireland will be charged &euro;25 to pass under the lifting bridge on the North Strand and &euro;25 each at the two locks into the River Liffey.  They will be charged the same &euro;75 on their return journey.  They will, therefore, be charged &euro;150 for supporting this organisation.  They are not going to listen to Elvis Presley.  I will send on the documentation I have received to the Department.<\/p><p>The cruising permit may actually be illegal because it violates navigational rights in existence for nearly 800 years since 1216.  Yes, we must congratulate Waterways Ireland on the work it has done, but we must not let the measure go through the House without critical scrutiny.  The Minister should take on board the points raised by me on behalf of people who genuinely love messing around in boats.  They should be encouraged.  I thank the Minister for giving support to a recent project in Killaloe.  Lord Inchiquin, a descendant of Brian Boru, and others from Killaloe were grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s support for the project there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600011#K00200","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393415700,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach.<\/p><p>Waterways Ireland, established in 1999 under the British-Irish Agreement Act, is charged with the management, maintenance, development and restoration of Ireland's inland waterways, principally for recreational purposes.  In total, it manages some 1,000 km of waterway on both sides of the Border, including the Shannon navigation, the Lower Bann, the Barrow navigation, the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal and the Shannon-Erne waterway.  Coming as I do from the Border county of Louth, I have always had an interest in the Ulster Canal which runs from Lough Erne in County Fermanagh to Clones in County Monaghan.  However, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on plans to fund the restoration of this canal.  Significant income was expected to be raised to cover the cost of the cross-Border route by selling Waterways Ireland assets, but the recession has set matters back.  Planning permission to reopen the 14 km route from Lough Erne in County Fermanagh to Clones in County Monaghan has been granted by local authorities north and south of the Border.  New towpaths and bridges will be created as part of the &euro;35 million work which is expected to take three years to complete.  The Ulster Canal is a disused waterway running through parts of counties Armagh, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cavan and Monaghan.  It originally linked the Lough Erne river system with Lough Neagh, but it has not been used since 1929.  The economic downturn has had a negative impact on proposed plans.  Despite this, the Ulster Canal project is progressing incrementally.  I look forward to the section of the canal from Lough Erne to Clones being completed in the next few years.  It will add to the existing tourism potential of counties Cavan and Monaghan.<\/p><p>The headquarters of Waterways Ireland is located in Enniskillen, with regional offices located in Carrick-on-Shannon, Dublin and Scarriff, County Clare.  Waterways Ireland reports to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, in Northern Ireland.  It is managed by a chief executive who reports to the North-South Ministerial Council and joint sponsor Departments.  Some 85% of current expenditure is met by the Government in the Republic, with the remaining 15% being met by the Northern Ireland Government.  Capital expenditure is funded solely by the Government in the jurisdiction in which work is being undertaken.  This year the Minister will provide over &euro;24 million for Waterways Ireland.<\/p><p>Since its establishment, Waterways Ireland has restored the Royal Canal to navigation, opened up new cruising destinations at Boyle and Ballinasloe, developed integrated recreational facilities at Lough Key, Enniskillen, Clondra, Killaloe, Clashganny, Shannon harbour, Enfield and Mullingar, doubled mooring capacity and developed a necklace of recreational services all along the waterways.<\/p><p>Over one quarter of Ireland's 1,000 km network is man-made, over 200 years old and still works in the way designed.  This is remarkable and a credit not only to the original engineers but also the continuing maintenance work carried out by Waterways Ireland staff.  From undertaking bank repairs or weed-cutting to managing canal side vegetation and keeping verges and towpaths accessible, day-to-day maintenance work is essential to the smooth running of the waterways.<\/p><p>Waterways Ireland, in research undertaken into the private boating sector, estimates it is worth between &euro;80 million and &euro;100 million per annum to the national economy.  In a separate study undertaken by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Waterways Ireland of the cruise hire sector, it is estimated that it contributes between &euro;15 and &euro;20 million per annum.  Waterways Ireland is planning further research later this year which will further quantify the economic and social dividend from inland waterways.<\/p><p>Waterways Ireland is also obliged to manage the canals and, in that regard, preparing new by-laws for consideration.  It recently concluded a public consultation on its proposed revision of by-laws.  Many who live on boats on waterways could see their waterways fees rise very considerably from &euro;150 per annum to &euro;3,500 under the new proposals.  This is a significant increase, if true.  Over 100 people live permanently on their boats on waterways.  The new proposed charges would mean a fee hike from &euro;152 to &euro;1,250 to &euro;3,500 for household moorings, depending on location, the services available and size of boat.  Hundreds more boat owners would be affected by an increase in fees from &euro;152 per annum to &euro;1,600.  Boat owners who moor in the same location for more than five days could face fines of up to &euro;5,000.<\/p> <p>The proposed charges are excessive and, if implemented, will damage the tourism potential of our waterways and cause us to lose significant business, while many small mooring locations may disappear.  I urge the Minister to consider seriously the proposed charges and establish more reasonable ones for all boat owners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600012#L00200","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393416300,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I wish to share four minutes of my time with Senator Jim Walsh.  <\/p><p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan.

He is probably training in the evenings and we wish him well.  I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss this issue with him.<\/p><p>Our waterways, from the point of view of tourism, heritage and culture, are very important because anyone can avail of this magnificent resource.  Much work has been done to progress them in the past 20 years, including the establishment of Waterways Ireland, one of the six North-South implementation bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement of 1999, which was a very welcome development.  Some 85% of the funding comes from the Irish Government, with the remaining 15% coming from the Stormont Executive.  Waterways Ireland has responsibility for managing, developing, restoring and navigating the waterways.<\/p><p>Other speakers, including Senator David Norris, have referred to concerns being expressed by boat owners about the new draft by-laws which are due to go for the Minister's consideration.  The issues being raised with us regarding the revised by-laws are that if they were to be implemented, they could, according to the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, IWAI, result in a serious decline in boat traffic on the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal and the Barrow navigation.  A spokesperson for the IWAI recently stated that if the proposals were to be approved by the Minister, more than 200 years of boating activity on the canal system could be killed off.  I am not entirely sure that would be the case, but that is a concern being expressed.  I am unsure as to what discussions have taken place between the IWAI and the Minister's office on its concerns.  Perhaps it is early days yet and the discussions are ongoing.  I suggest that, if one has not happened, a meeting with the IWAI take place to discuss some of its concerns before the Minister signs the draft by-laws.<\/p><p>Senator David Norris referred to the five-day moving period.  The fine would be &euro;150 if stationary within a 3 km distance within five days.  The reason someone would hire a boat or bring his or her own boat onto a canal is for tourism purposes, for a holiday, but it is also therapeutic because one is moving very slowly down a river.  I am not sure there are benefits to be gained in confining this.  On the one hand, I can see the rationale behind charging because one needs some income, but, on the other, perhaps it requires further consideration by the Minister in consultation with the IWAI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600013#M00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1393416300,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill as ucht ceithre n&oacute;im&eacute;ad a thabhairt dom chun an t-&aacute;bhar seo a phl&eacute;.

Our waterways are a major resource and amenity for the people and tourism.  I am afraid the Government, like its predecessors, does not place much of the focus on the south east.  We have very navigable and beautiful rivers within our jurisdiction.  The Nore and the Barrow are very popular and scenic waterways.  People involved in the boating business in the area have expressed some concerns to me.  Waterways Ireland has committed to developing the canal system as a vibrant recreational waterway and enhancing our ability to manage the navigation in a more proactive way.  However, I do not see much evidence of this on the Barrow.  It has been mentioned that no changes have been made to the regime for 24 years and that is reflected in many of our waterways.  I understand why the Government would consider applying charges of between &euro;600 and &euro;3,500 per year and charging for a mooring permit.  However, it is important that the charges be pitched at levels conducive to encouraging people to use the waterways and to attract tourists.  Not much of this has been happening.<\/p><p>For most of my career I worked in the port in New Ross.  Invariably, German and Dutch seafarers, in particular, would remark on the great amenity the river was and how under-utilised it was, pointing out that in continental countries rivers were regarded and utilised as tremendous amenities.  They said if the river were in their locations, it would be full of boats.  It has also been brought to my attention that there is now a five-day mooring limitation being brought in.  This fails to recognise the failure to provide mooring facilities along the river.  There is a beautiful and popular five-mile walk from St. Mullins to Graiguenamanagh which is also a nice, navigable, scenic boating area.  However, there are very few berths in St. Mullins and Graiguenamanagh and one has to go to Vicarstown above Athy to find the next safe mooring area.  These issues must be tackled because imposing impositions such as this is a little bureaucratic.  We need to be proactive in dealing with the practical issues connected with boating.<\/p><p>Waterways Ireland has failed, for example, to tackle the issue of unpaid fees.  It has also failed to deal with the issue of abandoned craft along the river.  These are issues which, presumably, have invited some of the measures about which I am talking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600013#M00300","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1393416300,"counter":122,"content":"<p>The Senator's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600013#M00400","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1393416300,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I think we are okay on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600013#M00500","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1393416300,"counter":124,"content":"<p>The Senator has had four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600013#M00600","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1393416300,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to examine the imposition of regulations which could impact negatively on the use of the river and try to facilitate the slow-moving heritage barges, some of which have been attracted to New Ross in the past few years because of the marina.

His attendance here is timely because it gives us an opportunity to contribute to the process, rather than discuss it when it is too late and after the horse as bolted, as it were.  I commend the Minister on that as we have not been afforded that facility by every Minister.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Deenihan, has shown he is a listening Minister who responds and engages.  The vexed issue of turf cutting throughout the country is a good example or template.  There were problems and issues, but the Minister met people half way.  I appeal to him to do the same today.  I welcome the representatives of Waterways Ireland.  They are well intentioned and I know their hearts are in the right place.  They have done great work with the canals.  The canals have been reclaimed from a disastrous situation where many of them were dumping grounds.  I also welcome the representatives of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, led by its president, Carmel Meegan.  What I am attempting to do today is to get both sides to meet somewhere in the middle of the water and to parley.<\/p><p>Laws, regulations and rules that are, and are seen to be, unfair, unjust, draconian and harsh will not work.  They will not have any public acceptance.  I ask the Minister to make a policy intervention and to leave a legacy that he and the Government can be proud of in respect of the management and use of our canals and inland waterways.  The inland waterways, and particularly the canals, have been the poor relation in our history with waterways.  In 1958, the CIE Act caused devastating damage to the canal system, from which it has never really recovered.  It resulted in the tearing up and filling in of the canal network.  Imagine the barbarity and vandalism of filling in canals.  We will never be able to recover or replace them.  The canal spur from the town in which I grew up, Monasterevin, to Portarlington and Mountmellick is filled in and gone forever.  All that remains are the ruins of the bridges and the ruins of the warehouses in the harbour in Mountmellick.<\/p><p>These proposed by-laws have the capacity to do the same damage to the canal system, if we do not move away from them.  The decision of 1958 did untold damage and resulted in the loss for this country, its heritage and tourism industry of an amenity that can never be recovered, even if we set about trying to create it today.  I am not appealing to the Minister solely on behalf of the approximately 100 people who live on their boats, the approximately 700 boat users who navigate the Grand Canal, Royal Canal and Barrow Way or the 2,100 individual submissions made to Waterways Ireland in the short three week time period that was given, but on behalf of the 70 communities across the midlands that rely on and require a vibrant canal network to flourish, so boats can continue to use the canal.<\/p><p>The proposed by-laws will drive boats off the canal.  They will deter tourists and others from hiring boats and will deter people from investing in hire companies.  They will deter the small businesses that spring up around the canals.  In 70 towns and communities across rural Ireland, people are crying out to build and develop a fledgling tourism industry.  Where I come from is not as popular as the Minister's native County Kerry in terms of attracting tourists.  The area is grasping at the straws of small amenities and facilities to draw people to towns such as Tullamore, Edenderry, Vicarstown, Athy and Monasterevin.  I grew up on the canal, with the River Barrow and the famous aquaduct.  This issue is near and dear to my heart because I enjoyed many a great day fishing and swimming in the canal and waiting for the barges to arrive down to Moore's Lock.<\/p><p>We must encourage access, not deter it.  I accept that the by-laws have not been changed since 1986, but that is not the fault of the boat users or of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, the people who are keeping the canal alive and flourishing in concert with Waterways Ireland.  We should all sing from the same hymn sheet instead of being at odds about this.  Is there any walk of life, business or leisure activity that could bear a tenfold increase in charges?  Nobody could bear it.<\/p><p>My colleague, Senator John Kelly who, along with me, called for this debate, will deal with the issue of people living on the boats.  However, the irony is that in a week that the Government published a plan to tackle homelessness, this policy will put people on the side of the road.  One cannot, in one action, catch up with the by-laws after 25 years and at the same time increase charges, levies and fees tenfold.  Nobody in their right mind would use the canal.  This does not just apply to the navigation but also to the mooring charges, the houseboats and even to the dry dock.  If one wishes to take one's barge out to repair and maintain it, the charges that would be accrued over the few months that it would take to repair the boat would, in some instances, cost more that the boat itself is worth.  How can that be in the interest of development?<\/p><p>This is not simply a parochial issue, although I have been inundated with representations from Sallins, Robertstown, Tullamore and many other places.  As Mr. Gerry Feery of the Ballycommon Canal Renewal Group said in a communication to me, it is not equitable to penalise users of the canals with high charges when they do not exist on other waterways.  This is the problem - it will drive people off the canals.  One of the submissions received by Waterways Ireland was from the Dutch Barge Association, which states that this policy will restrict access and make the canals less appealing to visitors from Europe.  In fact, I believe this would not happen in the UK, Holland or Poland.  Those countries would encourage people to use the canals, not deter them by levying fees that are unbearable.<\/p><p>As Senator Norris correctly pointed out, we are not dealing with Monte Carlo.  We are dealing with Monasterevin, so let us get grounded on this issue.  The people who use the canals are people of frugal means and the services and facilities in many places are Spartan, to say the least.<\/p><p>I commend Waterways Ireland on the work and investment.  I genuinely thank the Minister for coming to the House before he signs these draconian proposed by-laws into law.  There is still time for common sense to prevail so we can work together to ensure the canals can flourish and thrive into the future.  Otherwise, we will do untold damage and that will be to nobody's benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600014#N00100","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1393416900,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Much of what I intended to say today has already been said by other Senators, so I will try not to cover the same ground again.<\/p><p>  First, I reiterate the importance of Ireland's tourism industry.  There was a small downturn in the industry for a number of years, but it is set to grow again.  It is a vital part of our economy.  In 2011, Ireland was voted the favourite holiday destination in the world by the readers of <i>Farmers Guide<\/i>, and it is undeniable that a contributing part of that would be our rivers and waterways.  They are not just important for the tourism industry but are also navigational and economic arteries.  They bring boat traffic for the tourism business and have significant amenity value to local communities.  Boats are the lifeblood of communities along the waterways and we should encourage them to visit the canal navigations and waterways.<\/p><p>  Like other Senators, I take this opportunity to commend the work done by the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland.  Later I will raise issues relating to the by-laws and mooring fees.  Being from Cavan, I note that the Ulster Canal has been mentioned.  Can the Minister give an update on the progress of the canal?<\/p> <p>Will the Minister update Members on the incremental progress being made by the inter-agency group on possible funding options?  Has a feasibility study or any other study been conducted on the viability of the proposal to extend the Erne navigation from Belturbet to Killykeen and Killeshandra?  I believe there were issues with regard to the environmental designations of the lakes.  I would appreciate if the Minister would comment on this or revert to me at a later stage.<\/p><p>The Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, IWAI, has expressed serious concerns about the proposed by-laws.  At a meeting on Monday, 10 February, it was reiterated that the proposed by-laws do not put user requirements, tourism development and local communities at the centre of the regulations.  Does the Minister agree that user requirements, tourism development and the local communities are in fact at the heart of the by-laws?  The by-laws will impact on the communities along the waterways.  As part of the consultation process the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, IWAI, arranged public meeting, met elected representatives, business associations and consulted with communities.  A vast array of knowledge and experience was brought to bear on the consultation process and I think the Minister needs to consider the findings of IWAI.  I will not develop that point further due to time constraints.  My colleague Deputy Sandra McLellan tabled a question to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on the negative effects that increased mooring fees, annual cruising permits and annual houseboat mooring fees will have for the public.  In the course of his reply the Minister said: &quot;These seven waterways make a vital contribution to tourism&quot;.  I do not think these proposals will help tourism.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that his response is balanced and takes account of the genuine concerns expressed by the IWAI, the communities they represent and all those who have been consulted on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600014#N00200","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393417500,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I too thank the Minister for taking this debate, which Senator Whelan and I had called for. I do not think the Minister gets enough praise for the fact that he is prepared to come to this Chamber to listen to Members who express the fears that those in the Visitors' Gallery, among others, have about future mooring charges.  Consultation takes place in Government but Ministers do not usually come to the House until the decisions have been taken.  I appeal to him to take on board the views expressed in the House today.<\/p><p>In his speech, the Minister mentioned a place in my neck of the woods, Lough Key in Boyle, County Roscommon, as well as Ballinasloe and Leitrim.  The Minister acknowledged that the sector is worth between &euro;80 and &euro;100 million per annum.  He also recognises the benefits, both direct and indirect, that the waterways bring to the economy.  They sustain employment as well as having health and well-being benefits.  Central to the vision of the corporate plan of Waterways Ireland is the development of recreational, heritage and environmental opportunities that link people, history and nature, providing both communities and visitors with compelling reasons to spend more time on the waterways.  In his concluding remarks the Minister states that mooring spaces are difficult to access due to &quot;continuous harbour hogging.&quot;  I reject that assertion.  That remark is counterproductive.  The Minister made no mention of the proposed charges, which are the key to the problem.  <\/p><p>Many hundreds of people will be affected by the proposed charges.  Hundreds of these people have no other homes; they live on their boats.  The proposed charges, which were not mentioned in the Minister's speech, are such that if those people had a property on which they were paying property tax, the value of the property would have to be in the millions to equate to the proposed charge of around &euro;3,500 per year.<\/p><p>I listened to my colleague Senator John Whelan on &quot;Today with Sean O'Rourke&quot; debating the matter with Waterways Ireland.  The Waterways Ireland representation was trying to suggest that the proposed charge might only be an increase of &euro;4 per year, when the reality is that we are discussing charges that could be as high as &euro;3,500.  I know from listening to that programme that many of those who reside on the waterways have retired from the United Kingdom on very small pensions.  Some of them might not have an income of &euro;3,500 per year from their pension.  As a result of the imposition of these charges, many will end up homeless.  That will put more pressure on the housing lists.  They will eventually have to be housed.  The Simon Community in the midlands has no money to help the homeless.<\/p><p>This is a way of life.  As Senator Whelan said - he stole my thunder - turf-cutting was also a way of life.  We saw the trouble caused by those who did not want changes to turf-cutting.  I appreciate the efforts the Minister has made to address that situation.  I am aware that this EU directive was signed into law by the then Minister ten or 12 years ago.  The Minister has had to take the consequences on his neck.  Now, before any decisions on the waterways are taken, the Minister has to opportunity to listen to the people.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's suggestion that he should engage with the IWAI and listen to its views, and I am sure an accommodation could be found.  I have spoken to some of those who use the waterways who say they have no problem paying an increased charge if they get the services that they are not getting currently - Senator Norris made that point - but they do not have the means to pay the charges that are being proposed at present.  These proposed charges could be viewed as a threat to rural Ireland.  I would not risk the waterways by implementing draconian charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600015#O00200","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1393417500,"counter":130,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome.  I will not refer to the fees other than to say that Members, namely, Senators Whelan, Norris and Kelly, have spoken very clearly on them.  Fundamentally, the increase in fees will certainly reduce the usage of the waterways.<\/p><p>The major problem in the country is that there is no small ships register, so it is impossible to trace the ownership of most private boats unless they have a current licence for the Shannon.  The move to charge vessel owners seems extremely strange without this basic item being in place.  Will the Minister elaborate on how he will charge vessel owners without having any register?  The Minister should be establishing the basics in terms of boating and the waterways before he puts more fees on boat owners.  Why does the Minister not ensure that all boats are insured?  Insurance is mandatory for a car but not for a boat at present.  Why is that not the case for boats?  Does he have any plans to change that system?  It should be laid down in legislation that boats should have a minimum amount of safety equipment.  We desperately need to get this right.  As the Minister plans to put more fees on residential boats, we need to have some basics in place - for example, it should be mandatory for such boats to have an effluent holding tank.  Those providing moorings, including local authorities, should have to provide basic sanitation onshore.<\/p> <p>As many of the facilities at marinas are often accessed with a swipecard for security reasons, vandalism is not an issue.  One of the major problems with the proposed charges is that the boat owner will receive absolutely nothing in return in terms of facilities.  It is well known that most houseboat dwellers whose boats are not moored at fee paying marinas have a low level of income.  We have heard about their situation.  Is there a class issue in this regard?  What will be said when boating is only available to those who are well-off?  <\/p><p>I may be a little cynical, but it is likely that is too late to adopt the UK model, whereby every boat that uses waterways requires a boat safety certificate.  The checks include gas and fuel lines, etc.  The new scheme here will only provide loads of cash for inspectors.  As a business person, I have major concerns about a move to have more barriers in respect of waterways which are a vital cog for the tourism sector.  We have also heard plenty about this matter today.  <\/p><p>Many other massive issues need to be tackled such as boat insurance, mandatory use of safety devices and certificates before we can impose fees on boat owners.  We must have a situation where the customer - the boat owner - gets something back if he or she must pay fees.  I do not think he or she will get anything back for the extra fees, which are substantial.  To be successful in business, one must get the fundamentals right, but this plan does not deal with any of them.<\/p><p>I would be pleased if the Minister were to address my specific concerns, even though we are tight on time and others want to contribute.  He is welcome.  The fact that he has come here is greatly appreciated.  Senator John Whelan has expressed our appreciation, but we must use the time available to influence him in some way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600015#O00300","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393418100,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  When I came into the House today, I had not intended to speak.  However, having listened to the impassioned speech made by Senator John Whelan, I decided to make some notes and a contribution to the debate.<\/p><p>We are aware of the historical and cultural significance of inland waterways.  The great Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh wrote about canals.  I also recall that the Dubliners sang the words, &quot;the ould triangle went jingle jangle along the banks of the Royal Canal&quot;.  I also know, through my work with Bord F&aacute;ilte for many years, how important promoting the wonderful waterways of Ireland has been in attracting tourists.  The last cargo traversed the waterways in 1960, but the Dublin-Shannon connector, the Grand Canal, dates all the way back to 1715 when it was first proposed.<\/p><p>My appreciation of the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal stems from the days when I ran along their banks.  Waterways Ireland has done a tremendous job, not just in cleaning up the waterways but also in providing bike paths, walkways and runways which are greatly used for recreational purposes.  In general, however, the people of Ireland do not appreciate the wonderful waterways that are available.  They might gaze at the canal as they ride along in the Luas or they might drive along the canals in their cars, but our waterways are not greatly used to the extent that they deserve to be used.  <\/p><p>The reason I have decided to speak is I am appalled by the proposal to increase charges from &euro;150 to &euro;3,500 for use of the waterways.  As Senator David Norris indicated, one must move one's barge or boat every five days in order not to be charged the fees that will be introduced.  If there was a proposal to increase toll charges on motorways by many hundreds of percentage points, there would be uproar and motorists would be driven onto rural roads.  Let us look at the amount that we are now being charged in property tax.  It does not make sense that people must pay these charges at a time when we are encouraging them to use the waterways, from a domestic and international tourism perspective.  People using waterways should be charged.  If services are included, then well and good, but they are not and the charges should not be set at the rates proposed.  I, therefore, encourage the Minister to look seriously look at how he proposes to implement the new charges. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600016#P00200","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1393418100,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Like all of my colleagues, I welcome the Minister, particularly in advance of his signing-off on these draconian laws, a term used by Senator John Whelan.<\/p><p>  I commend the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, of which my late father was an early and lifelong member.  He proudly wore the inland waterways pin on his lapel throughout his life, mainly because he came from County Leitrim and was involved in the promotion of providing access to the Shannon waterway, which is not included in this proposal.  If it were, I would have received many representations. <\/p><p>  I cannot help but reflect on the fact that there was a time when people said the job of Minister for Defence was relatively easy, that the folio was non-contentious and that it was unlikely that he or she would have to declare that Ireland should go to war.  One always assumed that the same applied to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, that it was also a good news Department in which there would be no controversy.  However, the Minister is in the eye of the storm in this instance.  I cannot remember any issue that led to the receipt of over 2,000 submissions from such an important niche market as the tourism sector.  Over 2,000 submissions have been received and I am sure the Minister's officials are having difficulty in working their way through so many.  Perhaps the work has generated extra employment in his Department, which would be welcome. <\/p><p>  I commend Senators John Whelan and John Kelly for initiating the debate.  I know that Senator John Whelan injected a certain degree of righteous anger, rather than passion, when he spoke about what would result from these proposals.  He said Waterways Ireland had to be sent back to the drawing board.  He also made the following point - I quote from his statement of 3 February: &quot;I cannot fathom how anyone could have contrived the draconian, punitive and prohibitive regime of charges, rules and fines for users of the Grand and Royal Canals.&quot;<\/p><p>  Another Government backbencher, Deputy Anthony Lawlor, wrote to the Minister to say he personally believed the proposed changes to the by-laws would have a significant negative impact on the tourism industry.  Even within the Government parties there is severe discontent and concern about the proposals made.<\/p><p>  I wish to quote from a submission made by the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland about what it called the genuine letters of support and concern from communities submitted during the consultation process.  It stated:<blockquote>Navigation on the Grand Canal, the Royal Canal and the River Barrow will be drastically curtailed by the proposals of Waterways Ireland.  The IWAI can confidently state that the proposed bye-laws do not put user requirements, tourism development and local communities at the centre of the regulations.  The bye-laws proposed by Waterways Ireland are in fact a major threat to the community economic gain of boat travel on the Grand Canal, the Royal Canal and the River Barrow. <\/blockquote>The association also quoted the mission statement of the Department of the Transport, Tourism and Sport, which states: &quot;To ensure that the transport, tourism and sport sectors make the greatest possible contribution to economic recovery, fiscal consolidation, job creation and social development&quot;.  That Department is similar to that of the Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, because it is involved in the promotion of tourism.  The association also wants the Government to ensure &quot;Tourism is a big picture topic&quot;.  It continued: &quot;Through these bye-laws, loss of boat traffic will result in the loss of socio-economic, heritage, cultural and tourism benefits&quot;.  It conceded that &quot;The boating community is not averse to appropriate management, facility provision, and access to waterways.  But boats are key attractions, as the lifeblood of the navigations, and need to be welcomed&quot;.<\/p><p>  As Senator John Whelan said - he quoted a number of international sources which had made submissions - Inland Waterways International which is based in Ottawa, Ontario made the following point in a detailed letter to Waterways Ireland:<blockquote>It appears that there is a cumulative effect with the large increases across the board.  Boaters will not only see increase in the cost of their fee to navigate and use the locks, but also an increase in fees for the mooring of their vessels.  With no private or alternative options, users will either have to pay the increases, move their vessels off the canals or decrease their use of these impacted canals.  It is our observation that in such a scenario, use decreases. <br \/><br \/>  There is also concern about the cost for the dry dock use.  It does deter those with heritage vessels from using the facility, because their repairs usually take more time.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>The association also made the point that:<blockquote><br \/>The ongoing difference in treatment of land-based visitors versus boaters is accentuated with these latest changes.  However, the other users also represent a cost to the canal, albeit somewhat less than boaters, e.g. fishers, kayakers, canoeists, walkers and cyclists.  How to collect from these users is always the key issue.  Towpath permits, fishing licences, parking fees are some of the ideas that have been tried elsewhere.  The point is that canals and canal authorities need to be mindful of the division that takes place when one group appears to pay for services and the other more or less &lsquo;gets a free ride&rsquo;.  Boaters are easy targets because they are a captured users group, but canal operators need to put some time, effort and resources into collecting from the other users of these canals and these changes being proposed highlight the need to do this sooner than later.<\/blockquote>It states finally:<blockquote>It goes without saying and our observation, as we noted earlier, these changes will certainly have a dampening effect on use.  The concern always is that over time there will be less use, then less maintenance because the traffic does not support the expenditures and again less use and the cycle slowly descends into an abandoned canal. <\/blockquote>I am sure the last legacy the Minister wants coming out of his Department and he moves on and upwards in the scheme of things is that during his time canals were abandoned and ended up derelict after all the investment that has been put into them.  I plead with him, as all sides of the House have done, to revise these charges and go back to the drawing board, as Senator John Whelan has said, and look at them because they are detrimental and negative and without any justification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600016#P00300","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393418700,"counter":135,"content":"<p>As I was not present for the commencement of the debate, I welcome the Minister to the House and invite him to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600017#Q00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1393418700,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Carmel Meegan and the representatives from the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland.  I understand Waterways Ireland has discussed the by-laws with the IWAI and that IWAI works closely with Waterways Ireland in the development of many of the facilities we enjoy around the country.  Having opened some of them, such as the new cruising destination at Boyle and the new marina at Ballina-Killaloe, they have changed both villages, and people such as Keith Wood would accept that his restaurant business has improved considerably since the new moorings were put in place.  All those developments which have been provided in collaboration between IWAI, other organisations and Waterways Ireland are welcome.<\/p><p>  Waterways Ireland is one of the most progressive and successful cross-Border bodies.  It manages 1,000 km of waterway on both sides of the Border, most of which is in the Republic.  That connectivity is very important.  I work closely with my counterpart in Northern Ireland, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, on the Irish language and on waterways.  I get great satisfaction out of this element of my Ministry as I see a positive future for the waterways in Ireland and, perhaps, extending them in the future.  Senator Jim Walsh mentioned the possibility of extending to the Nore which is not part of it but, perhaps, extending it to other waterways in the future.  <\/p><p>  I acknowledge the work of the IWAI and its president and its commitment to the waterways and also in finding the right solutions. Certainly Members made very important contributions on the by-laws and other issues to which I will refer.  I thank all the Senators who participated, especially Senator John Whelan and Senator John Kelly who asked for the debate.  Of all the debates I have come to listen to and address, this one is opportune and it certainly informs Waterways Ireland and myself on what the by-laws are all about and the fact that they must be considered very carefully before a final decision is arrived at.  I acknowledge the contributions of Senators David Norris, Terry Brennan, Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, Jim Walsh, John Whelan, John Kelly, Kathryn Reilly,  Feargal Quinn, Paul Coghlan and Paschal Mooney, all of which were practical and helpful.  I will mention a few of the issues raised.<\/p><p>  Senator David Norris was very exercised about the <i>Naomh &Eacute;anna<\/i>.<i><\/i>I remind the House that neither the Department nor Waterways Ireland own the <i>Naomh &Eacute;anna<\/i>.  It is owned by Irish Nautical Trust and has been parked in the canal since 1989.  People took an interest in it when they discovered for health and safety reasons that it had to be taken out of the canal because if it sunk it would have major environmental repercussions and also there is a good deal of asbestos on the vessel itself, which gives rise to health concerns.  In view of the fact that Senator Norris appears to have some concrete proposals on this, I am prepared to extend the period within which people can come up with a proposal.  As one who is interested in heritage and preservation, I will extend the time to 31 March.  If any one has a concrete and realistic proposal and can show where he or she can get the money - which would be about &euro;6 million - we can look at it.  I am prepared do extend it to 31 March to see whether any concrete business plan emerges, including the source of funding, to restore the vessel and to keep it.<\/p><p>  In the past Senator Norris made a point about the<i> Jeanie Johnston<\/i> and the <i>Dunbrody<\/i>.  Preserving or restoring a vessel of this nature costs a great deal of money.  Various issues were raised about the <i>Jeanie Johnston<\/i> at the time which cost in the region of &euro;15 million.  It is parked in the docklands and it attracts some interest but people have always questioned the amount invested in the <i>Jeanie Johnston <\/i> and its value.  To restore and to ensure the re-use of vessels of this nature costs money.  If I get a business plan, with Waterways Ireland and the other interested parties, namely, the Irish Nautical Trust, the owner of the vessel, I will certainly consider it.  <\/p><p>  As regards the by-laws, people were concerned about the length of the consultation period.  That is set down in law in the Canals Act.  Certainly, when 2,100 people made observations it meant it was sufficiently long.  If it had been for six weeks maybe we would have got 4,000 observations.  Obviously, the consultation was very successful given that it attracted so many submissions.  Waterways Ireland is the body responsible for the by-laws.  I have to sign off on them for the South, my counterpart has to sign-off on by-laws for the North.  No doubt it will consider very carefully the submissions made but also the contributions made by the Senators today which are important.  The Senators have a passion for the waterways and have a connection with them and speak with authority on them.  When I get the proposals I will come back with the interested Deputies and Senators to discuss them.  It is important that we have by-laws and regulations.<\/p> <p>The regulations should enhance our waterways rather than discouraging the public from using them or even depending on them for a home.  The IWAI plays an important role in that too.<\/p><p>A subject I am interested in is the Ulster Canal.  In 2007, it was agreed by the North-South Ministerial Council that the Ulster Canal would go ahead and it was to be funded by the Republic from the sale of property in the docklands.  At that stage, I suppose we were still experiencing high property values here in Dublin, the crash had not come and there was a realistic chance of getting &euro;35 million.  However, the crash then came and the funding was not available.  Property prices are rising again and there may be an opportunity to commence the project.  Certainly, that would be my intention.  We had to go through a process of planning permission and that has now been completed.  The next phase will be land acquisition.  Generally speaking, people on both sides of the Border are co-operative in that sense.  Land acquisition will be followed by the start of work.  Waterways Ireland and my Department are exercised about this.  It is something I would be delighted to be involved with during my ministry and, if it were possible, I would like to get something going.  It will have my full attention in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600017#Q00300","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393419300,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.

It would form a spectacular network of waterways in this country that would be unequalled anywhere.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn raised some further issues that may not be covered in the by-laws, such as safety, registration, licensing and insurance.  I will ask Waterways Ireland to consider those relevant issues.<\/p><p>I thank the Senators for inviting me here today.  This was a useful debate that I am sure can make a difference.  From that point of view, it is opportune.<\/p><p>I reiterate that one of the most successful initiatives, apart from the peace we enjoy, that came out of the Good Friday Agreement was this body, Waterways Ireland.  It is important that we work closely with Waterways Ireland, at both Department and community level, towards ensuring that we maximise the vast potential of the waterways.  As I stated in my contribution, many of these waterways go through some of the most deprived and isolated parts of the country, and this gives us a great opportunity to rebalance economic activity to give assistance and hope to those living in isolated rural areas.  In a way, part of the magic of the inland waterways is that one can go through landscapes that are relatively untouched and serene to find solace in these places, but at the same time they are in some of the most deprived parts of the country.  There is a great opportunity here to do something progressive and positive for all of those communities touched by the 1,000 km of waterways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600018#R00300","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Fines (Payment and Recovery) Bill 2013: Second Stage","time":1393419600,"counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600019#S00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1393419600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1393419600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600019#S00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1393419600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>As Members are aware, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is detained by business in the other House today and has asked me to stand in for him in this debate.  On his behalf, I am pleased to present the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Bill 2013.  This is a very important item of reforming legislation that has at its core the twin objectives of ensuring to the greatest extent possible that the fines imposed by the courts are paid and that where they are not paid, there are ample alternatives to imprisonment available to the courts.<\/p><p>  The Bill addresses these objectives in three ways.  First, it ensures that fines are set at a level that the person can afford.  It then makes it easier for the person to pay the fine by providing that all fines above &euro;100 may be paid by instalments.  Finally, where a fine is not paid, the court can make an attachment order, a recovery order or a community service order, rather than imprisoning the person.  Of course, there may be a residual, small group who still will face imprisonment but it is expected that their number will be far less than the approximately 8,000 currently imprisoned for the non-payment of fines each year.  The landmark innovation in the Bill is the introduction of attachment of earnings for unpaid fines.  Attachment orders will only be made where it is appropriate to so do but where they are made, the fined person's employer will be required to deduct the amount of the fine from the person's earnings and pay it to the Courts Service.  This provision will address those who, despite being employed and having sufficient resources to pay a fine, do not so do in the hope that they will never hear about it again.  Underpinning the approach in the Bill is the general principle that if one has the income, cash or other assets to pay the fine, the courts will then recover the fine.  The Minister asked me to mention that he will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage requiring the court to first consider the making of an attachment order and only where it has determined it would not be appropriate to make one will the court proceed to consider making either a recovery order or a community service order.<\/p><p>  The second major change is in respect of recovery orders.  While these were provided for in the Fines Act 2010, it was in a manner that was largely unworkable.  Recovery orders allow for the recovery of the fine, including by the seizure of assets that can be converted into cash.  Rather than making recovery orders automatically in all cases where a fine is imposed, as provided for in the 2010 Act, a recovery order will now be one of three options open to a court when a person defaults.  The Minister intends to bring forward another amendment on Committee Stage, which will refine further the provision in order that generally, only fines that are greater in value than &euro;500 can be subject to the recovery order provisions.  This is to ensure, as far as possible, that the recovery process is not invoked where small fines are concerned.  Finally, under the 2010 Act, community service was only considered after a person had failed to pay a fine and a receiver had failed to recover it.  In this Bill, community service will be available to the court from the point that the default provisions are engaged, subject only to the amendment I mentioned earlier, which will require the court to first consider making an attachment order.  This makes community service an integral part of the fine recovery system and will reduce significantly recourse to imprisonment for the non-payment of fines.<\/p><p>  Turning now to the Bill itself, section 1 provides for the Short Title and commencement, section 2 defines terms used in the Bill and section 3 is a standard provision dealing with the making of orders and regulations.  Section 4 deals with repeals.  Section 5 is an almost identical provision to section 14 of the Fines Act 2010, which was commenced in 2011.  It obliges the court to take into account the person's financial circumstances in determining the amount of the fine, if any, to impose.  Section 6 provides that a fined person has the option of either paying the fine in full by the due date for payment or by instalments over 12 months.  Where the person chooses to pay by instalments, an administration fee of up to 10% may be imposed.  Subsection (5) provides that the option of instalments is only available where a fine of at least &euro;100 is imposed.  The Minister intends to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to delete paragraph (<i>b<\/i>) and to instead allow the court to take into account that a fine does not qualify to be paid by instalments when it fixes the due date for payment.<\/p><p>  Section 7 provides that where a person fails to pay a fine by the due date, the court will fix a date for a hearing at which it will make a recovery order, an attachment order, or a community service order.  As I stated already, the Minister intends to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage that will have the effect of requiring the court to first consider making an attachment order and to restrict recovery orders to fines exceeding &euro;500.  Where the court decides that none of the aforementioned orders is appropriate, it may commit the person to prison.  Section 8 deals with the appointment of receivers and the making of recovery orders to recover unpaid fines, including by the seizure and sale of property belonging to the fined person.  The main difference between this section and section 16 of the 2010 Act pertains to the making of recovery orders.  In the 2010 Act this was to be done automatically, whereas this is not the case in the Bill.  Otherwise the sections are almost identical.  One change is in subsection (5), which allows the receiver to delegate such of his or her functions to his or her employees, servants, bailiffs or agents as he or she thinks appropriate.  This is to clarify that the receiver is not obliged to personally carry out all of the functions.<\/p><p>  Section 9 provides for the issuing of notices in electronic format.  This is a new provision that is not contained in the 2010 Act.  Section 10 provides for the appointment of receivers and I note section 20 of the 2010 Act contains a similar provision.  Section 11 provides that where a fine has not been recovered by the receiver, the person will be brought before the court and the court has the option of making a community service order or committing the person to prison.  Section 12 deals with the circumstances in which a recovery order may be terminated or revoked.  Section 13 provides that moneys paid into court by a receiver are to be paid to the Minister for Finance or, where the fine is properly due to another body, to that body.<\/p><p>  Section 14 deals with the making of an attachment order.  Subsection (1) states that where the fined person is in employment or in receipt of an occupational pension, the court may make an order directing the person's employer to deduct the fine from the person's earnings and to pay the sums deducted in the manner specified in the order.<\/p> <p>Subsection (2) provides that the amounts deducted must be sufficient to ensure the fine is paid within 12 months of the date the order was made but gives the court discretion to require a shorter period, for example, where a considerable portion of the fine has already been paid by instalments.  Subsection (3) sets out the information to be included in the attachment order, including the amounts to be deducted and the frequency at which deductions are to be paid over to the Courts Service.<\/p><p>Section 15 deals with compliance with an attachment order.  It provides in subsections (1) and (2) for the service of the attachment order on the person's employer or on any person who subsequently becomes the person's employer, at his or her residence or place of business or by sending the order or a copy of it by registered pre-paid post to either.  Subsection (3) requires the employer to comply with the order but states that he or she is not liable for non-compliance during the first ten working days. This is to allow for the situation where the employer is not the person's employer in which case, under subsection (5), the employer is required to notify the court accordingly.  <\/p><p>Subsection (4) requires the employer to advise the court where the person's earnings are, for whatever reason, insufficient to meet the order.  Subsection (6) requires an employer who ceases to be the person's employer to notify the court within ten working days of his or her ceasing to be the person's employer.  The employer is also required to pay over to the court any moneys already deducted from the employee under the attachment order.  Subsection (7) requires the employer to give the person a statement of the total amount of every deduction made in compliance with the order.<\/p><p>Section 16 deals with notification of changes in employment and employment status and sets out what is to happen where the person is no longer in employment or where he or she has moved to a new employer.  Section 17 states that an attachment order will cease to have effect on payment in full of the fine.  Where a person ceases to be in employment, the order will be revoked.  Section 18 makes similar provisions to section 13 in regard to attachment orders.  Section 19 amends the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983 to insert into that Act provision for the making of community service orders in regard to the non-payment of fines.  Unlike the situation in regard to community service orders generally, it will not be an offence to fail to comply with a community service order.<\/p><p>Section 20 amends the Courts (No. 2) Act 1986 to provide that the court may commit a person to prison where he or she has failed to pay a fine in full or where the fine or part thereof remains outstanding following the appointment of a receiver or the making of an attachment order.  The court may also commit a person to prison where it is not possible to make a community service order because either the person does not consent or the probation service does not consider the person suitable for community service.  The Act is also amended to provide that the court shall commit a person to prison where the person has failed to comply with the terms of a community service order.<\/p><p>The Bill makes different provisions depending on whether the fine was imposed summarily or on indictment.  A table is inserted into the 1986 Act setting out different numbers of days, ranging from five to 30, to be served depending on the amount of the fine outstanding.  Where the fine is imposed on indictment, a prison sentence of up to 12 months may be imposed.<\/p><p>Section 21 deals with the method by which notices referred to elsewhere in the Bill are to be served.  Section 22 amends the Courts (No. 2) Act 1991 to provide that in so far as section 1 of that Act or section 23 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851 are concerned, penal sums are to be dealt with in accordance with the Bill once section 7 has been commenced.<\/p><p>Section 23 provides for data sharing and exchange for the purposes of assisting the courts in the collection of fines.  The Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Social Protection, and any other person prescribed by the Minister under section 3 shall provide the court with any information in their possession or control which the court may require in order to fulfil its functions in regard to the payment and recovery of fines.  Section 24 sets out the order of satisfaction where a person part-pays a fine and the balance is not recovered.<\/p><p>In this Bill, we are making it easier for people to pay fines and we are providing extensive alternatives to imprisonment where people default.  There will be no excuse for people not paying a fine in the future.  It will be set at an affordable level and then they can pay it over 12 months but if they fail to do so, the full rigours of this law will apply.  Depending on their circumstances, the court will either attach their earnings, appoint a receiver to recover the fine or put them on community service.  In the unlikely event that no order can be made or where they fail to comply with a community service order, they will face imprisonment.<\/p><p>This Bill revolutionises the fines payment and recovery system in Ireland.  It goes some way towards ensuring that the disrespect shown for the law by some is neither ignored nor rewarded but is instead challenged and defeated.  It sweeps away a fines system designed for the 1800s and replaces it with a modern statute that is in tune with the realities of 21st century Ireland.  It is amenable to the deployment of the latest technologies and is at one with the shift towards the use of non-custodial alternatives in the criminal justice system.  This is a Bill for our times and it is my privilege, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600019#S00400","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393420200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I am glad to see the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, back in this fine establishment where he started his national political career.  He is always welcome in this House.  My party, Fianna F&aacute;il, supports this Bill which builds on the original Fines Act introduced by the then Minister, Mr. Dermot Ahern, in 2010.  The current system imposes an unsustainable administrative burden on the prison system which sees more than 7,500 imprisoned annually for non-payment of fines, which is a ridiculous situation.  This strains the capacity of the prison infrastructure which should be focused on dealing with hardened criminals.  It is important that sufficient IT resources are put in place to accommodate the new flexible instalment payment process.  That is a critical aspect of this Bill.  If that is not put in place as soon as possible, implementation of the Bill might be dragged out.<\/p><p>We welcome the thrust of the Bill which draws on the 2010 Act and goes a few steps further, which is important and appropriate.  We believe there should be an extension of the payment instalment period beyond the 12-month timeframe to accommodate large fines and the struggle to pay in this current economic climate.  Imprisonment exacts a hefty toll on the State's finances with 7,500 imprisoned annually, which is a significant cost upon the State and a personal trauma for the individuals involved.  Most of these people should not see the inside of a cell for the non-payment of a fine.  The instalment method should not be punished by a punitive interest rate which is mean spirited and hits those who are least able to pay the fine hardest.  <\/p><p>An attachment of earnings order where the fine is deducted directly from wages should be a last resort.  It places an unfair administrative burden on employers and will damage the working relationship between employers and the recipient of the fine.  It may have the perverse and unfair effect of undermining the employment prospects, including promotion, of the recipient within his or her firm.  <\/p><p>Community service should be welcomed where people simply do not have the means to pay the fine.  It should be used to replace the imprisonment mechanism and give communities a real practical benefit from people who have committed an offence.<\/p> <p>Statistics show that there has been a slow but progressive increase in the prison population and a sharp increase in the daily average number of persons in custody over the past decade.  This appears to show a slow increase in prison numbers, which has been exacerbated by an increase in the number of people imprisoned for minor offences but which has been held back by overcrowding.  In 2009, there were 10,865 committals under sentence, which represented an increase of 35% on 2008.  Of those 10,865 committals, 9,216, or 85%, were for sentences of 12 months or less, which is extraordinary.  By comparison, 1,667 individuals were issued with community service orders in 2009.  Prison does not act as a deterrent and has a negative impact on prisoners.  Research appears to indicate that short prison sentences act neither as a deterrent nor as a means of rehabilitating offenders.  An article by UCD academics, entitled Recidivism in the Republic of Ireland, concludes that offenders sentenced to prison terms of less than six months have high rates of reoffending.  Utilising alternative methods to reduce the prison population and administrative burden are important in the context of tackling the pressure under which the Prison Service is operating and addressing the issue of recidivism.  Imprisoning people for the non-payment of fines acts as an administrative burden and fails to be an efficient deterrent.  The Bill goes a long way in that regard.<\/p><p>Paying fines via instalments is provided for in section 6 and it is a good provision. The provisions of the Bill would give the choice to the person fined and the court has to inform such a person of his or her options.  This would apply to fines of more than &euro;100 and fines have to be paid in full within one year.  The Minister can fix an administration fee generally, not individually, to fines but this fee cannot exceed 10% of the total fine.  The administrative fee should not be placed as a further burden to fine levels that inflict a further punishment on recipients.  This is the duty of the courts and not the Minister.  The fee should reflect a realistic costs analysis of how much the new instalment system will cost to implement.<\/p><p>The Bill adds the new option of an attachment of earnings order.  Recovery orders and community service were provided for under section 17 of the 2010 Act but the section allowing for this has not yet been commenced.  The key issue is that these alternatives are employed to avoid a jail sentence.  It is ridiculous that section 17 of the 2010 Act has not come into force.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the Houses and when it is enacted I hope to see implementation sooner rather than later.  Attachment of earnings orders, where the fine is deducted directly from wages, should be considered as a final effort to retrieve the fine due.  It places an unfair administrative burden on employers and will damage the working relationship between employers and the recipient of the fine.<\/p><p>The Bill changes the system of community service to provide that failure to pay a fine can merit a court sentence of community service.  This was envisaged in the Fines Act 2010, although section 18 of that Act was never commenced.  The level of community service will be based on the scale of the fine and how much has been paid to date.  It is an important part of rebalancing our justice system towards rehabilitation and making a contribution towards communities that we utilise community service rather than imprisonment.  Increasing the use of community service delivers financial savings, diverts from the prison system offenders who would otherwise be imprisoned, and provides reparation in the form of unpaid work to the benefit of the community.<\/p><p>The Irish Penal Reform Trust has estimated that imprisoning fine defaulters costs the State more than &euro;2 million per year in courts, Garda and prison Service resources compared with the costs of making the necessary upgrades to the courts IT system to process payments by instalment, estimated at &euro;400,000.  That amounts to a saving of &euro;1.6 million per year, which is extraordinary.  Hopefully, this IT system can be rolled out quickly.  It is vital that the Government accelerates the IT upgrades necessary to facilitate the new payments structure.<\/p><p>The Bill is welcome and represents progression from the 2010 Act, which the Government I was involved in introduced, and I wish it every success.  With regard to the imprisonment models of Norway, Sweden or Finland, I looked at a programme on television the other night when I happened to be in my son's house.  Some 70% of those who went through the open prison community service system used in Norway, rather than the system of locking people up and throwing away the key, did not reoffend.  As a member of the justice committee, I went to see an open prison in Finland where people could go back to college.  They lived in an open environment and ran a coffee shop.  They had their own bedrooms and there was no such thing as the iron bars closing.  The sooner we can move from the old British prison system we inherited from the time of the Magna Carta, the better.  There is a significant number of serious criminals involved in killing people and in gang warfare.  They must be incarcerated and guarded carefully.  They are not safe to be left on the street.  They have no respect for law, for us as politicians, for the Government or for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They are a minority in the prison population of 7,500 but they must be securely incarcerated.<\/p><p>I came across a man brought from west Cork to Dublin and put into Mountjoy Prison for non-payment of a small fine.  Four hours later, he was let out to return home.  We must get away from a system where we incur the cost of hiring a taxi and of being accompanied on the journey by a garda in the case of a man who would not say &quot;boo&quot; to a goose to appear in court for an unpaid fine.  I hope the Bill will be a success.  Fianna F&aacute;il will fully support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600020#T00200","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393420800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for stepping in for the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I thank Senator O'Donovan for his constructive comments.  He has experience of dealing with the District Court as a practising solicitor.  I welcome the Bill, which is designed to increase the level of fines collection and to keep a number of people committed to prison for the non-payment of fines to an absolute minimum.<\/p><p>In 2012, the number rose to 8,300 in 2012 and these people represent a considerable proportion of those committed to Irish prisons for short periods.  Legislation is already in place requiring judges to take a person's financial circumstances into account when setting a fine.  The Minister of State touched on that point.  When the Bill is enacted, it will be easier for people to pay a fine and, where they fail to do so, there will be sufficient alternatives available to the court to all but eliminate the need to commit anyone to prison for the non-payment of a fine.  The option exists if the fine is not paid.<\/p><p>The Bill represents a major reform of the fine payment and recovery system in Ireland.  Once the measures are in place, every person on whom a fine is imposed will be able to opt to pay the fine by instalment over 12 months.  Where a person fails to pay a fine in full, including by instalment, he or she will be required to return to court and, depending on circumstances, the court may make an attachment of earnings order directing the person's employer to deduct the fine from earnings, a recovery order appointing a receiver to recover assets to the value of the fine, or a community service order.  The introduction of an attachment of earnings order for unpaid fines is a commitment in the programme for Government and is likely to be applied in most cases where a fine defaulter is in employment or in receipt of an occupational pension.<\/p><p>In dealing with the area, it is important to consider the cost to the State.  As pointed out by Senator O'Donovan, arresting someone takes up Garda time.  Transport to prison and the prison process must be gone through and the person must be discharged to return home.  There is a great cost to the taxpayer and reducing the cost is welcome.  It is also a progressive way of dealing with matters in that it shows that, where someone has committed an offence, the person cannot abuse the system.  Some people have abused the system and ignored the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the courts.  It makes it far more difficult for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement the law.<\/p> <p>The change we are discussing this morning is welcome and long overdue.<\/p><p>Under the Bill every person on whom a fine is imposed can opt to pay the fine by instalments over 12 months.  Where a person fails to pay a fine, the court may make an attachment order, a recovery order or a community service order, as I have already mentioned.  There are a number of different options giving discretion to the court, which would apply the most appropriate method.  Where an attachment or recovery order is made but the fine or part thereof remains outstanding, the court may make a community service order.  If somebody has decided to make a payment by instalment but defaults, there is still an opening for the courts to apply a community service order.  The Bill also creates a new offence of failure to comply with an attachment order, which would attract, on conviction, a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or up to 12 months in prison.  The courts are being given the power to deal with somebody trying to ignore the courts or the justice system, which is very important.<\/p><p>There was reference to a sheriff appointed under the Court Officers Act 1945 who may be a receiver, so we would not be appointing somebody new into the justice system but using the existing facilities, which is a welcome change.  There is also the issue of data sharing between the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection and the Courts Service, which is also welcome.  This is about all the arms of the State working together to ensure we have an efficient system and the law is complied with by everybody.<\/p><p>The Minister of State may not be able to deal with the following issue but it is important to highlight it.  I refer to the use of the court poor box, and a number of issues have been raised recently in the media in this regard.  The court poor box is used when a judge does not want the person before him or her to have a record; a penalty as such is not imposed but the person is required to make a contribution to the court poor box in order to deal with the matter.  I am not sure if the Minister of State or the District Court has dealt with this in recent weeks but there have been a number of newspaper articles on the matter.  In one case a District Court judge has decided to specify how moneys for the poor box are to be used.  According to the articles, that member of the District Court is designating a particular charity of which a member of the judge's family is in charge.  Such action is of concern.  If we have a court poor box system, there should be some regulation of it.  I am a little concerned about this as such an issue does not benefit the court system.  The Minister should examine it and perhaps he has dealt with it in view of the articles published over the past two or three months.  The media reports have led the general public to be concerned about the way in which the matter is operated.  A regulation should be put in place and the matter should be dealt with appropriately.  Perhaps the Minister has dealt with it behind the scenes.<\/p><p>I very much welcome this Bill, as it is important we have a foolproof system in place to ensure every decision taken by the courts would be fully implemented and that there would be full compliance with the law.  If there is not full compliance with the law, the system will break down.  I thank the Department of Justice and Equality staff and the Minister for coming forward with this legislation and dealing with the issue as it exists on the ground.  It is extremely important.  This legislation can be put in place immediately and will create a far more efficient system that we badly need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600021#U00200","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393421400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and the Bill to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It will bring about progress and I echo what previous speakers have stated about it decreasing the number of people imprisoned as a result of failure to pay fines.  We know from the figures outlined by the Minister that approximately 8,000 people per year are currently imprisoned for non-payment of fines, and I hope this Bill will significantly reduce those numbers.<\/p><p>As outlined the Bill provides a number of options for people to pay fines and avoid serving prison time, which will reduce prison numbers.  That is always welcome.  It is important that the Bill allows us an appropriate alternative proportionate to the offence that has been committed.  I particularly welcome the measure in section 5 which states that circumstances will be taken into account by the court before any fine is imposed; this ensures that no harsh or unfair measures will be introduced.  I also welcome the provision for an option to undertake community service, as it can benefit society and individuals and is an alternative remedy to the position in which they find themselves.  In difficult financial times, people are making tough choices and very often they are made on behalf of children and the family.  It is not something people design, and we know that many instances of families breaking up arise from financial issues.  We encourage people to pay fines but if that is impossible, we must find appropriate alternatives proportionate to the offence.  The majority of people are imprisoned in Ireland because of minor offences, so we must find other ways to deal with matters in an appropriate justice system, especially when people simply cannot pay fines because of financial difficulties.  The Bill provides alternatives, such as community services or garnishing of salaries.<\/p><p>We can also consider benefits to the State, including a reduction in prison numbers and the processes through which the State must go.  I look at this Bill in how it can help families, as it provides a way out, which is why I wholeheartedly welcome the legislation.

As other speakers have done, I very much welcome the Bill, which fits well in a welcome general trend in criminal justice policy to try to reduce reliance on imprisonment and ensure people are not committed to prison for convictions for minor offences and cases where a fine has been imposed but not paid.  Others have already mentioned the large numbers of people still being committed to prison, and there were 8,304 committals to prison for fine default in 2012, including 1,687 female committals.  There is real concern because the Irish Penal Reform Trust has indicated that the large number of women committed to prison in 2012 for fine default represented a five-fold increase on the 2008 figure, when 339 women were imprisoned for fine default.  As we know, there is serious overcrowding in the D&oacute;chas Centre and we do not have an open prison for women; all convicted women are sent to the closed prisons of the D&oacute;chas centre or the Limerick prison.  It is a matter of grave concern that so many women are being committed to prison for non-payment of fines.<\/p><p>Others have pointed out how this builds on the Fines Act 2010, which was introduced by the previous Government.  The real concern is that the 2010 legislation, which had the same admirable and welcome objective, never took effect, with significant numbers of people still being committed to prison every year for fine default.  The reason for the non-implementation of the Fines Act is that the court ICT systems have not received the necessary upgrade to process payment of fines by instalment.  The legislation is very welcome and the new Bill repeals Part 3 of the 2010 Act but replicates and improves it.<\/p> <p>The real concern is whether the infrastructure will be available to ensure that the Bill is implemented so that the aim that we all agree with can in fact be put in place and that we will see a dramatic reduction in the number of people committed to prison for fine default.  I accept people are generally committed for very short periods of time.  It can be a matter of days or sometimes only hours but nonetheless they are clogging up the prison system.  Being committed to prison has a considerable detrimental impact on those concerned and their families, in addition to the considerable cost to the State.  There is a social and economic cost.  We are all in agreement that the situation needs to be remedied and we very much hope the Bill will do so.<\/p><p>The Bill has been broadly welcomed, not only by parties on both sides in the other House and in this House, but also by NGOs.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust has very much welcomed the Bill and has made some constructive points on it.  I wish to raise those with the Minister of State, who might perhaps pass them on.  The Bill provides for instalments to be paid over a 12-month period.  The Fines Act 2010 had allowed greater flexibility with instalments to be paid over 24 months in some cases.  I wonder if that could be considered in the Bill.  It has been indicated that the Minister will bring forward useful and important amendments on Committee Stage in this House.  We welcome that but he might consider an amendment also along the lines I outlined.<\/p><p>The administration charge of up to 10% on a person paying a fine by instalments might also be reconsidered.  The suggestion is that perhaps a flat administration fee or a capped administration fee would be preferable, in particular as the Bill provides for fines payable on indictment for convictions that follow an indictable offence.  We could see quite large administration charges if they are based on a percentage amount.<\/p><p>Fines of more than &euro;100 came up also in the context of the 2010 Act.  I accept there are issues around the cost of administration if one is talking about fines of less than &euro;100 becoming payable in instalments but nonetheless &euro;100 may represent significant hardship for certain individuals.  I question whether it would be possible to reduce that to &euro;50 or &euro;75.<\/p><p>Prior to the debate, Senator Colm Burke and I were discussing a more general issue, namely, the change to ensure that people will not be sent to prison as a first option where they have defaulted on a fine and that community service orders, CSOs, would instead be imposed.  That was also in the 2010 Act.  There was always a concern that the use of the CSO would amount to net widening, that in other words people who would never have been sentenced to prison might now be sentenced to a community service order, which when it was introduced in 1983 was supposed to be an alternative to imprisonment rather than an alternative to a fine.  The Bill strikes the right note because it should not be too easy for a judge to impose a CSO where somebody is in default of a fine because that would make it appear as if a community service order was equivalent to a fine.  It is important that a procedure is in place whereby people would be brought back to court for consideration as to whether a CSO would be imposed where they have been in default.  It is only as an alternative to imprisonment in cases where people would otherwise have been imprisoned for non-payment of a fine.  The concern that both the Free Legal Advice Centres and the Irish Penal Reform Trust have raised is that we might see people being put on community service who would never have been contemplated for imprisonment and that it would therefore widen the net in terms of serious penalties for minor offences.<\/p><p>Those minor caveats aside, we all very much welcome the Bill.  We welcome the context in which it is introduced where we are seeing an attempt to reduce our reliance on imprisonment.  A number of Senators who are members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence were involved in the penal reform report the committee produced last year in which we specifically called for a reduction in the use of imprisonment for a policy of penal moderation or decarceration to be adopted where we would see fewer people being sent to prison each year and a particular approach taken to people convicted of minor non-violent offences whereby they would have sentences commuted to community service rather than having to serve terms of imprisonment.  I see the Bill as part of a general policy of penal moderation and I very much welcome it in that context.  We all very much hope that we will see a very small number of people only being committed to prison for non-payment of fines in the future.  The key issue is whether the infrastructure will be available to ensure the Bill will be effective in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600022#V00300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393422000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, is very welcome back to the House of which he was a Member some time ago.  On a previous occasion I referred to the fact that he had been demoted to the other House.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s moves to help to ensure that fewer people are jailed for non-payment of fines.  It has been interesting listening to the speakers who recognise the aim, objective and, I hope, the success of the Bill.  We have an antiquated system and I am pleased the Minister is doing something about it.  A measure such as allowing people to pay fines in instalments is a very sensible move.  However, I have some questions and concerns on the Bill that I would like to raise.<\/p><p>The first is the right to enter a person&rsquo;s property and to remove items.  I have major concerns about section 8 which deals with &ldquo;the appointment of receivers and the making of recovery orders to recover unpaid fines, including by the seizure and sale of property belonging to the fined person&rdquo;.  In particular, section 8(3) sets out the powers of the receiver on the seizure, holding and disposal of the property of a person in respect of whom a recovery order is made by the court, that is, for the non-payment of a fine.  The receiver has the power to enter a premises, including a dwelling - alone or accompanied by a member of the Garda - and to demand, and take possession of the property of the fine payer.  I am very concerned by this part of the Bill.<\/p><p>First, it has the potential to worsen how our fines system operates as it increases fear.  We could have the situation where persons have no income, cannot pay the fine and the next thing they know is that they have a stranger, with a legal right, entering their property demanding and indeed taking away something that could be precious to them.  It will be an offence to stop such a person from taking away one&rsquo;s property.  That is extraordinary and must at the very least be contrary to a person's basic human rights.  At worst, it may be unconstitutional, in particular in terms of Article 40 of the Constitution.  Article 40(5) of the Constitution reads: &ldquo;The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.&rdquo;  Section 6(2) of the Criminal Law Act 1996 allows entry and search of any premises, including dwellings, for the Garda to make an arrest in certain circumstances in relation to a very specific criminal matter.  Non-payment of a fine does not have any relation whatever to those clauses.  By enacting the legislation as it stands, it is eroding the power of the Garda as it is giving other persons more power to enter property which is something that is also of concern.  The provision should be re-examined.<\/p><p>The Seanad must stand up against such a proposal.  It is not correct to give such massive powers to act against someone for the very small offence of non-payment of a fine.  This part of the Bill should be significantly changed, or if that is not possible, then it should be deleted in its entirety.  I urge the Minister to consider the matter again.  In this country, it is quite difficult for a member of the Garda to enter a person's property and a warrant is usually required.  The Bill changes the situation and means that a receiver now has the right to violate the dwelling of a citizen for what could be a comparatively trivial matter.  I am sure those who fought for the foundation of the State would be wholly opposed to such a move.  For that and many other reasons, I object to the provision in the Bill.  I do not think anyone should be allowed to enter premises without a member of the Garda and to seize property.  That is unprecedented.  It is worse than being in a police state &ndash; it is the privatisation of police powers legalised by the Government.  I would like my concerns to be addressed.  I call on other Senators to examine that part of the Bill extremely closely.<\/p><p>Another concern relates to the extensive new obligations on employers.  I also have major concerns about sections 14, 15 and 16 which deal with deducting earnings from a person.  I have some concern with the State directly interfering in a person&rsquo;s personal finances.  However, it has done that already through measures such as the pension levy.  My real concern in this area is that the court may make an order directing the person&rsquo;s employer to deduct the fine from the person&rsquo;s earnings and to pay the sums deducted in the manner specified in the order.  That is a private matter and I do not agree that a person&rsquo;s employer should become yet another party in the matter of a fine.<\/p> <p>We are working hard to encourage employers to take on more people and to encourage business start-ups.  Every little step we take that makes it more difficult for an employer makes it less likely that the employer will take on more people.  Britain had a rule that if a new law was introduced an old law had to be removed.  That rule has now been changed whereby for each new law that is introduced, two laws, which are usually out of date, must be removed.  Every time we introduce something extra, particularly if it hinders or stifles the ability of an employer to take on more people, we have to question whether it is necessary or if there is an alternative that we can avoid.  Certainly, this is one other obstacle to an employer creating more jobs.  <\/p><p>I welcome the whole tenor of the Bill.  I know the effort that has gone into it.  It has a very worthy objective and a worthy motive but it can be improved and I would like to see that improvement take place on Committee Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600023#W00200","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393422600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  I have been campaigning for a Bill such as this for many years.  The current system, where fines are concerned, is an absolute farce.  We all know that.  Given that many fines cannot be collected, a mechanism should be put in place where people who want to do so can pay by instalments.  There are quite a number of people who will not pay, irrespective of whether they can or not.  These people are with us.  A few years ago I recall suggesting an attachment of earnings order and so on and I was accosted in the street by a guy who said:<blockquote><br \/>The cheek of you, trying to take money out of my pocket.  I have been in jail several times.  I will never pay a fine.<\/blockquote>There are people who will go jail for payment of fines.  They go through the courts system.

The Bill goes some way to addressing the issue.  The Bill represents a major reform of the fine payment and recovery system.  Once these measures are in force, every person on whom a fine is imposed will be able to opt to pay the fine by instalments over 12 months.  Where a person fails to pay the fine in full, including by instalments, he or she will be required to return to the court, depending on his or her circumstances.  The court will make either an attachment of earnings order, directing the person's employer to deduct the fine from the person's earnings, a recovery order appointing a receiver to recover assets to the value of the fine - I am aware Senator Feargal Quinn has reservations in that regard - or a community service order.  The introduction of an attachment of earnings order for unpaid fines is a commitment in the programme for Government and is likely to be applied in most cases where a fine defaulter is in employment or in receipt of an occupational pension.  What about people on social welfare who can afford it?  Are such persons exempt?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that issue.<\/p><p>The Bill is designed to increase the level of fines for collection and to keep the numbers of people committed to prison for non-payment of fines to an absolute minimum.  We should aim to have as few people as possible in prison for the non-payment of fines because it costs the State a huge amount.  As Senator Colm Burke said, the numbers increased to 8,300 in 2012.  Those people represent a considerable proportion of those committed to Irish prisons for short periods.<\/p><p>Legislation is already in place requiring judges to take a person's financial circumstances into account when settling a fine.  When the Bill is enacted it will be easier for people to pay a fine and if they fail to do so there will be sufficient alternatives available to the courts to all but eliminate the need to commit any person to prison for non-payment of fines.  The option, however, will remain.<\/p><p>The Bill also contains a number of administrative changes that will improve the court's capacity to ensure that fines are paid.  When the legislation is enacted I hope we will be in a position to implement its provisions in early course.  There is no point in enacting legislation if we do not have all the mechanisms in place to implement it.  What measures are being considered?

Why has it only ever been partially commenced?  Surely, there is a better way to legislate than this.  That aside, I welcome the Bill which strives to modernise the courts' fine system in Ireland and offers an important alternative to imprisonment.  If effective, the Bill will ensure there are fewer prisoners in our jails serving short sentences for non-payment of fines.  The differences between imprisoning people versus imposing community service on them are striking.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, informs us that there were 8,304 committals to prison for fines default in 2012 which is a very significant number.  What is even more striking is that more than 85% of persons imprisoned for non-payment of fines returned to prison within four years.  Unfortunately, this highlights that some people prefer to serve time in prison than to pay a fine.  For those who have already spent some time in prison, being sentenced to a day or, in some cases, a couple of hours in prison, is no deterrent when it comes to the non-payment of fines.  The system in its current form is not working and needs reform.<\/p><p>I wish to avail of the opportunity to speak briefly about the great work undertaken by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in its report on penal reform in March 2013.  I fully supported all the recommendations contained in the report and look forward to working towards implementing them with my party colleagues.  The first two recommendations of the report were a reduction in prison numbers via a decarceration strategy which would reduce the prison population by one third over a ten-year period and, second, that all sentences of less than six months, in respect of non-violent offences, should be commuted and replaced with community service orders.<\/p><p>In 2012, 272 people were jailed for non-payment of television licence fees, according to the Irish Prison Service.  This is a prime example of where community service can be used as an alternative.  We do not want a situation where people, particularly elderly people, are facing prison sentences for non-payment of television licences.  I cannot let the occasion pass without stating again my support for Margaretta D'Arcy who has found herself imprisoned and is in the D&oacute;chas Centre located in Mountjoy Prison at present, ostensibly for highlighting lapses in our international policy regarding flights by military planes into Shannon Airport.  I hope the Minister will intervene with a view to a conclusion on that issue and to raise the issue to which Margaretta D'Arcy has drawn attention.<\/p><p>I welcome section 5 of the Bill which ensures that the court will impose a fine based on a person's ability to pay and take into consideration the impact of payment on a person's dependants.  However, in the first instance, the system should take into account a person's ability to pay a fine.  There was huge anger at the way the property tax was introduced, the methods put in place and the mechanisms given to the Revenue Commissioners to delve into people's accounts to pay that tax.  The issue was not the fact that the tax had to be paid but that it did not take into consideration the ability of people to pay in many situations.  They find that the property tax has been taken out of their bank accounts and they are short in other areas of their life, be that to pay the mortgage, keep food on the table and so on.  The ability to pay clause is absolutely essential. <\/p> <p> I would like the Minister to clarify whether there is a possibility that debt may be recovered via repossession of the family home.  The Minister of State might speak on that.  This may be something on which I will submit amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>Section 6(2) makes a change to the Fines Act 2010 with which I do not agree.  I would appeal to the Minister to retain the 24-month period as opposed to changing it to 12 months.  This makes sense, as I said previously, given the current financial climate.<\/p><p>There is also a suggestion from the Irish Penal Reform Trust and other NGOs that a flat administration fee or a cap be put on fines as opposed to the 10% charge which is set out in the Bill.  I would like to hear the Minister's reasoning behind this 10% charge.  This also may be something I will seek to amend on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>With regard to section 6(6), it is regrettable there is no instalment option for fines of less than &euro;100.  For many individuals and families today, &euro;100 is a significant amount of money.<\/p><p>Regarding section 8, the Irish Penal Reform Trust recommended that consideration be given to setting out a maximum level or proportion of receivers' fees where property is seized, and I agree with this.  I would also concur with the concerns raised by Senator Quinn.  I will discuss with my party colleagues the issue of giving powers to persons to enter the home to seize the goods of somebody who has been seen not to be in payment of the fine.  There may be questions which we will certainly discuss and, maybe, come back to on Committee Stage also.  In terms of section 11, it is worth querying where there is a failure to recover assets if community service or attachment will be an option pursued as opposed to imprisonment.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I reiterate my support for this Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it forward.  The Bill is a step in the right direction.  However, I have concerns around some aspects of it as I indicated throughout my speech and I will be submitting amendments on Committee Stage to strengthen the Bill where needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600024#X00500","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393423200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, to the House.<\/p><p>In welcoming the Bill, it would be appropriate to compliment the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, for bringing much innovation to his Department since assuming office a little under three years ago.  This is another commitment in the programme for Government that is being delivered.<\/p><p>As has been said, it is a straightforward piece of legislation to provide for the introduction of a system of attachment of earnings as a means of collecting unpaid fines with the intention of substantially reducing the numbers being committed to prison for non-payment of fines.  It is quite obvious that many in this country decide they will not pay a fine imposed on them because they know that even if they are given a custodial sentence for non-payment, they are likely to serve little, if any, time.  Senator Cummins mentioned that those who get a short custodial sentence are back home later that night, and sometimes before the garda&iacute; who brought them there in the first place, and I see it happen in my town on a regular basis.  This is happening because of a shortage of space in the prison system.  However, it came as a big surprise to me that 8,300 persons went to prison last year for non-payment of fines at a cost to the State of over &euro;2 million.<\/p><p>This is a compassionate piece of legislation in that it takes into account that many of those who find themselves on the wrong side of the law may have limited means at their disposal.  With this in mind, the Bill repeals Part 3 of the Fines Act 2010 to provide for a new payment and recovery system.  The key features of that are that it takes into account the level of a person's income when a fine is being imposed and when a person is fined, he or she can opt to pay in instalments over a 12-month period with an administration fee of 10%.  Where a person fails to pay a fine, the court can make an attachment order or recovery order.  I welcome that when either of these options is not feasible the court can make a community service order, which can also kick-in when fines are not paid in full.<\/p><p>It is also appropriate that we introduce a new offence of failure to comply with an attachment order which will attract on conviction a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or 12 months in prison.  There must be suitable deterrents to discourage one from failing to comply with attachment orders.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for the collection of fines from wages, salaries and occupational pensions, but in my view, there is a deficiency in the Bill in that there is no provision to collect fines through the social welfare system.  We all will be aware that in some instances there are significant incomes going into some homes through the social welfare system.  Over the weekend there were newspaper accounts of where in some situations there was in excess of &euro;75,000 being paid to some families.  Given that every person has a PPS number, surely it should be administratively possible to use the attachment order.  All that would be required is for the court to communicate the name, PPS number and the amount of the attachment order to the Department of Social Protection.  In my view, this discriminatory element in the Bill should be addressed.<\/p><p>Like Senator Quinn, I have concerns about the administrative costs that will be incurred, particularly by small businesses, in collecting the attachment orders.  I wonder whether it would be possible for an employer to receive some small recompense for the administration costs associated with collecting moneys for the State, and I ask the Minister to look at that.<\/p><p>I am pleased to support the Bill.  In my view, it is a fair system.  It will reduce significantly the costs incurred by the State by keeping those concerned out of prison.  It will reduce Garda time spent on trivial enough matters and free up the police force for policing duties in the community.  Most importantly, it ensures that only in cases of serious crime will persons be deprived of their freedom.<\/p><p>I compliment the Minister and wish him well in his efforts to modernise much outdated legislation in this country.

I am advised that community service will only arise in cases of default where other options are not available to the court.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn welcomed the Bill.  As regards recovery orders, these will only be made where a person has failed or refused to pay a fine and where he or she declared to the court assets that are sufficient to pay the fine.  These provisions are already in the Fines Act 2010, but I will relay the Senator's comments to the Minister.<\/p> <p>While speaking in support of the Bill, Senator Cummins asked whether people in receipt of social welfare benefits would be subject to recovery and community service provisions.  If a person in receipt of social welfare benefits has cash or other assets, a recovery order will be made.  In response to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, there is no question of a person's family home being seized.  However, the Minister will consider whether it is necessary to explicitly exclude the family home from the recovery process, and that can be done.  Overall, that is it.  As for the other points raised by Members, I note the presence of the departmental officials and these points will be related back to the Minister.

Out of respect for the House and its Members, it is important to set out clearly the Government's position on these amendments and on the Bill.  It will be recalled that in 2011, the Government announced that it had decided not to proceed with legislation to abolish upward-only rent reviews.  In that situation, proposed Government legislation which targeted tenants whose businesses might otherwise be viable were it not for the fact that the rent they were paying was significantly above market levels, was judged by the Attorney General to be unlikely to pass muster constitutionally.<\/p><p>Last October the Government took the decision to oppose Senator Quinn's Bill because of the legal and practical issues contained in it.  The Senator is now proposing certain amendments and it is only fair to acknowledge that they appear to draw inspiration from some of the observations made when the Bill was last debated.  However, the Bill, from the perspective of the Government, remains deeply flawed and, therefore, it has no choice but to maintain its opposition to it.  The proposal put forward by Senator Quinn inevitably involves the property rights of a landlord under Article 43 of the Constitution.  It retrospectively alters a contractual right - the right to receive and to have that rent varied by the operation of a particular rent review clause - and it has the potential to deprive landlords of a significant benefit which was freely negotiated.  This would not be the case where the State intervened to create a certain level of rent.  It is the case when the parties themselves reach a private agreement, in most cases with the benefit of appropriate legal advice.  They are the constitutional issues pointed out to us by the Attorney General.<\/p><p>The new limitations being introduced on Committee Stage are presumably intended to confine the disapplication of upward-only rent review clauses in specific leases to certain types of tenants but that, in itself, creates new problems as the only landlords affected would be those with tenants who meet the criteria set out in the new section 2 or the new section 3.  There are no criteria which take account of the circumstances particular to individual landlords who may themselves be reliant on the income stream represented by the disputed rent to meet particular financial obligations.  This has the effect of singling out a specific group of landlords to solve what is undeniably a very real problem for some in the retail sector.  This targeting inevitably has the potential to create arbitrary and discriminatory effects which are likely to impact significantly on the ability of the Bill to withstand constitutional challenge.  <\/p><p>There is a further point which is that the advice received from the Attorney General has always made it clear that a compensatory element is critical in terms of Constitution-proofing any legislative proposal which seeks to introduce a retrospective restriction on property risks.  The European Convention on Human Rights is applicable here also.  While our economy is clearly showing very encouraging signs of recovery, it is simply inconceivable that a compensation scheme, which carries with it no guarantees in terms of the Bill's ultimate constitutional compliance, should be introduced for affected landlords.  In any event, this Bill contains no such scheme.<\/p><p>There are still a number of practical difficulties associated with the workability of the Bill which could inevitably have an unforeseen impact on the commercial property market in view of the uncertainties that would thereby be engendered.  Our economy needs stability if it is to prosper.  There are things a Government can do to aid recovery in the retail trade and things which it cannot do.  Ministers across a range of Departments are working to create a business-focused environment and to reduce the cost of doing business.  Under the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, amendments have been introduced to facilitate access by small private companies to the examinership process which can be a valuable tool in terms of restoring viability to a company.  A commercial leases database is now operational, which over time should introduce much-needed transparency into the commercial property market.  Up to the end of last year, NAMA had approved rent abatements with an aggregate value of &euro;18 million, representing an approval rating of 97%.  <\/p><p>I stress the Government's commitment to ensuring we have a thriving retail sector and to providing support to that sector in all areas where such support is feasible.  On behalf of the Government, I take the opportunity to commend those landlords who have shown flexibility in regard to rent review negotiations and I urge those who have yet to show such flexibility to do so in the future.<\/p> <p>I urge those who have yet to do so to show such flexibility in the future.  The Government is willing to work with all sides of the House to improve the quality of legislation before us.  However, as our attempt to craft legislation in the area shows, the task of dealing with upward-only rent reviews in legacy leases is not an easy one and is beset by many constitutional difficulties.  The amended Bill put forward by Senator Quinn is not a solution to the problem.  The Government is maintaining its opposition to it and we will oppose it on Final Stage.  We are not shutting down debate until Final Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600027#AA00600","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393424700,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I said all I have to say on Second Stage.

If I make an opening contribution, it may put us in the frame of mind we all want.  I know the Senator was not pushing for Committee Stage at this time as we are working on the matter.  I thank Senator White and her colleagues for the opportunity to speak today on this important Bill.  As I mentioned when we last discussed it, the Bill and its intentions are laudable as they recognise the important role of both mothers and fathers in the care and nurturing of young children.  For that reason the Government decided not to oppose the Bill on Second Stage in July last year.<\/p><p>Before turning to the matter before us, I will provide some background on the types of relief currently available which are relevant to the debate.  There is maternity leave of 26 weeks which attracts social welfare benefit and is currently available to mothers.  An unpaid period of 16 weeks is also available to mothers and this is known as additional maternity leave.  There is adoptive leave of 24 weeks, which also attracts a social welfare benefit, currently available to mothers.  An unpaid period of 16 weeks is also available to mothers.  Parental leave of 18 weeks, which is unpaid, is available as an individual right for both mothers and fathers.  This leave can be taken in respect of a child up to age eight or, in the case of a child with a disability or serious illness, to age 16.<\/p><p>We currently have no provision for paternity leave, which in a number of other countries is available to fathers.  I agree completely with the spirit of the Bill and Senator White's view that it is important that fathers and their important role in nurturing children are acknowledged.  This is an omission in the current system in terms of promoting greater equality in society by encouraging a fairer sharing of domestic responsibilities between men and women.<\/p> <p>It is the Government's intention to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage as there are a number of substantial and technical difficulties with the Bill.  We fully accept the spirit of the Bill.  However, due to the complex nature of the amendments and the requirement to carry out consultation across a number of Departments and with employer organisations, trade unions and various NGOs, I am not in a position to present such amendments today.  I had hoped to come back to the Seanad with the Government&rsquo;s response in the first quarter of 2014 but the consultations are taking longer than we anticipated.  From Senator White&rsquo;s experience on the other side of the fence in the private sector, I know she understands the complexities involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600030#EE00400","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393425600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600031#FF00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1393425600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Today, all I can do is again point to specific issues of concern.  The Government will come back on Report Stage to present amendments to each section and provision of the Bill, including the Long Title.  It would have been a much better approach if Committee Stage could have been delayed until the Government was in a position to present its amendments.  The timing of Committee Stage was not at the request of the Senator.  I respect the decision of the House to take the debate today but I remind the House that the only way we can achieve change in this area is by working together across the whole of Government and with the social partners.  In the current economic climate, pressing ahead with a Bill on which there are real concerns as to the cost and affordability will not work.<\/p><p>I wish to refer to the work that has been undertaken by the Department and the issues raised by the consultation we have undertaken.  We have received many conflicting views.  There are many interested parties.  One of the strongest concerns &ndash; Senator White will be as surprised by this as I was &ndash; on the proposals in the Bill have come from the women&rsquo;s movement.  Women are concerned about losing some gains that have been hard fought.  We can assure women that recognising the role of fathers in the leave system is good for women but not on the basis of the set of specific proposals we have before us today.  There are also concerns on the potential impact on the social insurance system.  The proposals also have an impact on employers.  We need to tease out the implications and ensure we are completely satisfied that our proposals strike the right balance between supporting the role of fathers and protecting and encouraging small and medium sized businesses at a time when the Government is trying to support such businesses create much needed jobs.  When I was last in the House to speak on the Bill I suggested that we needed to think about an approach in which maternity leave would remain vested in the mother.  I still consider that essential.  I cannot support the removal of an existing right for which women have fought long and hard to achieve.  I know Senator White shares that view as well.<\/p><p>It is unclear from the Bill what is the intended timeframe of maternity or paternity leave.  In some places there are references to 14 weeks and other parts refer to 18 weeks.  Are there 14 weeks for both parents or 14 weeks to be shared?  We must provide certainty to both parents and employers.  I am open to the possibility of the mother being able to share a part of her leave with the father.  This period of leave that would be shared must be defined, excluding the minimum period which must be taken by the mother for reasons of health and safety and under EU law, which must be safeguarded.  In such a scenario the father would have to meet the necessary social protection requirements in his own right regarding social insurance contributions to receive payment.  The Bill requires more work to deal with the interaction between granting leave on the one hand and eligibility for social welfare benefits on the other.  Issues around the notice period for employers will have to be addressed and employment protection rights similar to those mothers already enjoy would have to be extended to fathers also.  Whatever approach is finally agreed we must ensure similar provisions also apply to adoptive fathers and mothers.  The issue of same-sex couples must also be examined.<\/p><p>In section 2 it is possible that a new definition will be required to define paternity leave as no definition exists in national legislation to address the issue.  Will I stop on section 2 or continue to section 3?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600031#FF00300","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1393425600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>We are on section 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600031#FF00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1393425600,"counter":206,"content":"<p>It might help the discussion if I continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600031#FF00500","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1393425600,"counter":207,"content":"<p>That is alright.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600031#FF00600","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1393425600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I am also of the view that in section 3 the current Short Title is misleading and incorrect.

I cannot support the amendment because we have not had time to examine it in detail but neither do I wish to formally oppose it or vote it down.  As with every other provision in the Bill we will need to review it and come back with substantial amendments on Report Stage.  I suggest that the Senator might agree to hold the two amendments back until Report Stage so that we could have a full discussion in light of the overall approach of the Bill the Government will bring forward.  We need to design an approach that will work and we need a full impact assessment on the amendment Bill.<\/p><p>The current Bill takes a very rigid approach to the sharing of maternity leave.

Much work with other relevant Departments remains to be done before the Government can come back with specific proposals.<\/p><p>My Department is currently preparing legislation to consolidate all the family leave legislation &ndash; maternity, paternal, adoptive and carer&rsquo;s leave &ndash; into one Bill.  Responsibility for carer&rsquo;s leave has been transferred from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Department of Justice and Equality in the context of the statute law consolidation exercise.  This consolidation will involve examination of possible discrepancies and anomalies between the various Acts with a view to making the code more accessible and streamlined.

I also thank Senator Wilson for seconding this Bill.<\/p><p>I came up with this proposal when I was preparing work on promoting women entrepreneurs in Ireland.  Only half as many women as men start up businesses here, but Enterprise Ireland has progressively focused on encouraging more women into business and has proved that action taken to support women entrepreneurs brings a positive result.  Therefore, we are focusing in this Bill on another approach that will offer support to women.  As we all know, Irish women today are totally different from those of previous generations, thanks to their education.  They are as ambitious as men and want to participate and have equal responsibility in society.  It is only right then that men should be able to participate in maternity leave.  It is unjust if they cannot enjoy a similar right to leave.  As asked earlier, why should men not be able to share in leave at the same time as the mother when a baby is born?<\/p><p>I will withdraw my proposal and will be happy to work with the Minister of State on the issue.  It is noteworthy that the Government is willing to accept an Opposition Bill and that the Leader wants the Seanad to move on its responsibility in society.  This is a sign of the importance of the role of the Seanad, which will not be seen as just deciding it will not have anything to do with the Bill despite knowing heart and soul that it is for the better of Irish men and women.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State, the Leader and my colleague Senator Wilson who seconded the Bill, which came about as a result of my research into how to support and promote women entrepreneurs.  If a woman is starting a business, she cannot very well run off for 26 weeks, because starting a business is time consuming.  Also, many unemployed men would be glad to stay at home and let the women go out to work.  There are many cases where the wives of unemployed men have new babies and would like to return to their work.  The proposal in this Bill is a milestone in the evolving role of men in society.  The proposal will also apply in the area of civil partnership and adoption and will be to the good of a more open society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600031#FF01600","speaker":"1156","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393426200,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I commend Senator White on tabling this Bill.  Today has been a good day for the Seanad - a day when the Leader has allowed Opposition Senators to move a number of Bills which have been on the Order Paper for some time.  I understand that over the next number of weeks, a number of other Bills on the Order Paper will also be discussed and debated.  This is the reason we are here and the decision to proceed in this manner is a positive move by the Leader.  Senator White is a Senator who is policy driven and has brought forward Bills which are constructive and which result from engagement with the community and people who will be positively affected by the outcome of Bills such as this.  She is to be commended on that.<\/p><p>The Constitutional Convention sat last weekend and discussed the possibility of including social, economic and cultural rights in the Constitution.  It was very interesting to observe in the discussions taking place in the workshops and in contributions from the floor that there was all-party support for the concept of including social, economic and cultural rights in the Constitution.  It struck me that we are moving in the right direction in this State, which is still a young State.  Some 100 years ago, anti-slavery laws were being introduced in the US and in this country the right to vote for everybody was being introduced.  These rights and the right of women to vote were all seen as radical ideas in their time, but now we take them for granted.  We are moving in the right direction all the time and those of us who are progressive and on the left are always trying to push out the boundaries and force states to do the right thing.  I believe the Constitutional Convention was thinking of issues like the one raised in this Bill when discussing social, economic and cultural rights. <\/p><p>I do not wish to make a Second Stage speech, but I do wish to make two comments before we come back to this on Report Stage.  I am a firm believer in the Scandinavian model, which has a lot to offer.  I do not believe we can just pick a model that exists in any one country and say it will work for us.  Whatever we decide on must be a solution for the people of this State, for parents and for the economy and resources must be taken into account.  However, it is worth looking at the Scandinavian model.  It invests 1% of GDP in early childhood education, whereas we spend just a quarter of that.<\/p><p>This brings us back to a discussion we have had previously.  We had a debate on the same issues in regard to mental health, but that debate was unhelpful in some ways because of other issues being brought into it.  The issue is whether we want to pay for these services and whether we want to raise enough taxation to allow us put services like this in place.  I am sure we will have the same debate when it comes to universal health care.  It must be paid for and we must decide whether the moneys required should come from progressive taxation.  I would say &quot;Yes&quot;.  I would like to see a universal child care system, but it must be paid for and must be paid for through progressive taxation.  Therefore, I am prepared to support progressive taxation.<\/p><p>One issue I would like to raise, and I will bring forward an amendment on this on Report Stage, is the need for paid paternity leave.  This is something we need in this State.  Sinn F&eacute;in policy is that it would like to see a move towards the international standard, of at least one year's paid leave after the birth of a child and two weeks statutory paternity leave.  That would be a huge step in the right direction for parents and children.  I understand there is a cost implication, but it is about getting the right work-life balance and about ensuring both parents get the opportunity to bond with their children at as early a stage as possible.  Unfortunately, fathers do not get those opportunities currently because they are not there.  <\/p><p>We are moving in the right direction and the Bill being discussed today gives us an opportunity to discuss the issues.  I welcome the helpful contribution and clarifications given by the Minister of State today and commend Senator White on her excellent work in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600032#GG00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1393426200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I too support Senator White and what she is trying to achieve in this Bill.  As Senator Cullinane has said, she is looking at policy and trying to work for the betterment of children and their parents.  I welcome the healthy approach the Minister of State has taken today, which shows us how the Seanad can work in a collegial way to achieve the outcomes we all want.<\/p><p>When it comes to Report Stage, what I will seek to ensure is that the Bill will provide for the first year of a child's life, which is critical for a child's development.  We need to develop our own model, but we must ensure that parents have a choice about which parents will take the major role.  We must find a way to do that.  The last time I checked the figures for Sweden, some 2% of children under the age of one year were in a child care setting.  The rest were being cared for by a parent or parents.  In Sweden, leave is provided to both mother and father and parents are allowed to choose how to mix that leave.  This also means that employers look at males and females in the relevant age category in the same way.  Therefore, the Swedish model has equality ramifications which are important for society and the type of equal society we wish to have.  <\/p><p>I support Senator White on this Bill and encourage her endeavours.

I wish to raise on the Adjournment the concerns that have been raised with me on the alignment process.<\/p><p>The local development companies have a very strong track record and expertise in the area of programme delivery and have in the past number of decades strengthened local democracy and community engagement and participation.  They have successfully delivered a range of programmes on behalf of a number of Departments.  I know the Minister will be aware of that.  As a result of the bottom-up community-led approach that these local development companies, LDCs, have adopted they have unrivalled expertise in their ranks, local knowledge, local recognition of their work in the communities and they offer value for money in the delivery of the programmes.  The community-led local development approach of delivering a broad range of programmes to tackle social exclusion, supporting rural development and job creation and enterprise at local level has been successfully delivered by the LDCs.  The European Commission has previously endorsed this approach to local development and recommended that this be adopted across other EU funds.<\/p><p>At this time it is not clear what the future holds or how local development companies will navigate their way into the next funding period.  It is essential that clarity is provided so that proper planning can be undertaken to manage changing circumstances and to ensure that these LDCs can make the transition to the next funding period.  The Minister established an alignment working group, bringing together representatives of the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, County and City Managers' Association, Pobal and Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government staff to work through proposals as to how the alignment proposals should unfold.  Unfortunately the alignment working group, as far as I am aware, has not met since September 2013 and the recent release by the Department of documentation to front-runner local authorities and then to all local authorities without sending them to the ILDN has in its eyes undermined the credibility of the alignment working group process.  It has frustrated members of the network.  There is great concern on the ground about this.  To be frank, the clumsy handling of this has caused a great deal of disarray in the community sector and especially in rural areas.  With the changes to the link community development, LCD, programme that are being proposed and the current Leader funding finishing, the timeframe associated with the process is challenging the continuity of delivery of frontline services, and we face challenges if the services are to be maintained.<\/p><p>There is a lack of clarity on the delivery mechanisms and the contractual arrangements between the local community development committees, LCDCs, and local development companies.  This has created a lot of uncertainty in my area as is the case in the Cavan-Monaghan Leader joint venture companies Breffni Integrated Limited and Monaghan Integrated Development.<\/p> <p>It is on behalf of these groups that I express my concern at the direction of the alignment process, nationally.  I am concerned that damage will be done to the delivery of community and local development programmes at a time when demand for these services and initiatives has never been greater.  We cannot afford to allow this to happen, especially in rural areas, which need every venture possible in order to boost the economy and keep jobs afloat. <\/p><p>The ILDN wants four issues discussed and perhaps the Minister of State will touch on them today.  First, the requirement that LCDCs will hold a tender process for the delivery of successor programmes through the local community development programme.  That is very important and is a bone of contention.  <\/p><p>Second, the urgent need to provide Leader programme transitional funding for a number of LDCs.  Third, the proposal that LDCs will become local action groups in the context of the Leader programme.  Fourth, the implications of such a decision for relevant LDCs and the management of communications to the ILDN in the alignment process.  These are some of the issues that have arisen.  They are important on the ground and community groups are concerned that expertise could be lost should the process not be handled properly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600033#HH01400","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393427100,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for placing the matter before the House.

His aim is to bring about greater co-ordination and targeting of scarce resources, reduce duplication and to provide a more efficient and cost effective delivery of local services.<\/p><p>There has been good progress to date, with input from the alignment working group which he established to advise him on the implementation of the alignment recommendations.  As part of this process, my Department has had ongoing contact with the Irish Local Development Network, the representative organisation for 50 local partnership companies.  There have also been a number of bilateral meetings with the network and the Minister has met them on several occasions and plans to do so again shortly.  He wants to emphasise that there has been a substantial amount of engagement with the local partnership companies on the alignment process.  The partnership companies are not the only stakeholders and, in that regard, the Minister and his Department have met representatives of the community and voluntary sector who are also important stakeholders.<\/p><p>The changes arising under alignment, including the establishment of local community development committees, will bring challenges for the companies relating to structures and staffing.  In the context of achieving better value for money, with continuing constraint on programme budgets and the requirement to undertake a procurement process for the delivery of the local community development programme, it is simply not possible to guarantee a continued high level of funding for all of the bodies involved.  These issues are part of the ongoing dialogue with local partnership companies.  He recognises, in particular, that the legal advice, to the effect that my Department must procure the delivery of the local community development programme, is a significant change to the previous arrangement which awarded the companies these public contracts without any competitive process.  We will manage the programme in line with the legal advice and procurement requirements.  I have confidence that, given their expertise and experience, the companies are very well placed to submit robust applications for future delivery of the programme.<\/p><p>The issue of procurement does not have the same implications for the Leader programme which is implemented by 35 of the 50 local development companies.  Leader is covered by EU regulations that sets out conditions by which the programme must be implemented and these do not require a competitive tendering process.  I see the partnership companies as key partners on the new local community development committees, with a strong implementation role under Leader and very similar to the delivery role that they currently have.<\/p><p>Change processes are challenging for all concerned but change is necessary, both as part of the overall local government reforms and to ensure the optimum use of scarce resources, especially for valuable local development funding.  I am confident that if we continue, as we have done in the past 12 months, to work in partnership and engage openly, the result will be a strong and robust local and community development model that will deliver real and sustainable results for citizens and communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600034#JJ00400","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1393427100,"counter":247,"content":"<p>The Minister of State mentioned the working group and the related process in his speech but the group has not met in five months even though the Department issued documents.

In the Constitution property rights are ranked second highest, right after the right to life, and I am up there with my support of those rights.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Finance to ensure that Irish homeowners are given the first right of refusal and a window of time to buy back their loans, if they so wish.  At the meeting earlier we heard from the special liquidator who said that 10% of the 13,000 people wanted to buy back their loans.  That means that 1,300 Irish people want the right to buy back their own home loans and perhaps set up a new mortgage with another Irish bank or institution.  It is only fair and right that they are given the opportunity.  <\/p><p>We also learned, at the meeting, that some of those Irish people who have home loans are prepared to offer more to the Irish Nationwide and the IBRC than a foreign bidder will give.  That will not do the State creditor any good because the State and NAMA own more than 70% of the loan book.  In light of what we have learned today, I ask him and the Minister to think seriously about giving a window of time to the Irish person, the Irish homeowner, the mother, father or individual, who wants to buy back their home loan.  We have heard that it will take another two months before the deal is completed.  Please give them all at least a month because we all know that it will take a bit of time to qualify, etc.<\/p><p>If people do not wish to buy back their home loan then we need to know home loans that sold to a foreign bidder have the protection of Irish law and practice, including the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Last night we learned, and we learned again today from the special liquidator, that the code is voluntary.  That is still progress but it is not written on paper.  We often use the phrase &quot;it is not worth the paper it is written on&quot;.  However, the code is in word only and is not written on paper.  The code is an act of goodwill but the Minister of State, who is a very wise man, will know that it is valueless.  It needs a statutory basis which I shall deal with.  Mr. Edmund Honohan, the Master of the High Court, has said that the green fields of Ireland will change hands and the secondary market for mortgages will grow.  Plus, Ireland needs to regulate for a secondary mortgage market and recognise that mortgages will be bought and sold abroad.     <\/p><p>Earlier in the committee room Ms Ann Nolan, from the Department of Finance, said that the Minister was looking at legislation.  That is great but this matter is so urgent that we must consider introducing emergency legislation so that none of the 13,000 people involved will be subject to abuse, higher surcharges, higher interest rates, etc. than they would have had to pay here.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State will know that the Ulster Bank is in trouble and is looking at selling out here next year.  That is only the beginning.  Mr. Honohan said: &quot;The need for legislation was broader than the Irish Nationwide problem.  Securitised and judgment mortgagees are not regulated by the Central Bank or covered by any consumer code.&quot; Therefore, we need to get on with the business of regulating and protecting all homeowners.  Those are my two requests and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600034#JJ00800","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1393427700,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising what is a very important issue.  I am aware that the liquidator and colleagues from the Department of Finance appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform today.  It was a useful exercise.  I saw some of the engagement.  I am aware that the Senator asked one of the officials from the Department of Finance about the question of legislation.  I will repeat what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said in the House last week, which was repeated to the Senator today by an official from the Department of Finance: that if successful bidders row back from the voluntary commitment obtained by the liquidator, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, will act quickly and decisively for the purposes of enshrining rights for people who find themselves in this situation.  I repeat that in the House this evening as the Minister repeated it last week.  As Ms Nolan told the Senator today, that is the firm position of the Government and we do not intend to change our position on that.<\/p><p>In relation to the proposals that mortgage holders be given first right of refusal to purchase their loans, it is worth pointing out that such an opportunity exists at par in the case of the liquidation in IBRC.  I think that is the correct course of action in the case of IBRC.  The special liquidator has written to each individual mortgage holder in this regard.  I understand from the appearance of the special liquidator before the Oireachtas committee today that approximately 400 IBRC mortgage holders have repurchased their loans to date.<\/p><p>There is no legal impediment to this course of action by the special liquidator, and the terms and condition of many mortgages, including non-IBRC mortgages, allow for redemption at par value.  The terms and conditions of the redemption would not be affected by the sale of any loan book.  There has been some discussion in the Oireachtas and the media in recent weeks about the suggestion that IBRC mortgage holders who have the financial capacity to do so would be given the exclusive opportunity to buy their mortgage loans at a discount.  There has also been the incorrect suggestion that this opportunity was offered to larger corporate borrowers in IBRC and that individual borrowers secured debt write-downs in certain circumstances.  I take this opportunity to state for the Senator and other members of the House that I have been informed by the special liquidator that no IBRC borrower is being provided with an exclusive opportunity to buy back its loans at a discount.  To direct the special liquidator to give this opportunity to any borrower or group of borrowers could affect the value of assets in the bank and could leave the Irish taxpayer open to legal challenge, future costs and financial risks.  That issue was highlighted today by the special liquidator in the evidence he gave to the committee, part of which I saw, where he said that the firm independent advice open to him and his colleague in terms of maximising the assets for the purpose of the taxpayer was to go down the route as he had suggested.  That was the firm advice given to him by way of his independent powers and the role and function given to him by both Houses of the Oireachtas through legislation passed last year.  <\/p><p>Again, in the case of IBRC, the obligation on the special liquidator is to ensure that maximum value is extracted from the loan sales process for the benefit of all creditors of IBRC, including the State.  The sales process plan and the timeline for the sale of the residential mortgage portfolio has been developed following professional advice and in light of requirements for a robust and credible sales process in that context.  The special liquidators have obtained this independent advice from PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC, in respect of the residential mortgage portfolio.  The special liquidators have decided that the residential mortgage would be subdivided into four tranches with a view to maximising market interest and return within the timelines set out in the ministerial instructions.  Obviously, in the case of future loan sales by other banks operating in Ireland, it would be a commercial and operational matter for the board and management of the institution to decide on the sales process.  As part of this consideration, issues such as individual mortgage sales and discounts would be considered.  <\/p><p>Turning to the code, as recently explained, the application of the CCMA to unregulated entities is something the Department of Finance is investigating in conjunction with the Central Bank and the Attorney General's Office.  This matter is legally complex and it could affect contracts already entered into.  It needs to be carefully considered.  I remind the House that it makes commercial sense for buyers to adhere to the CCMA, as evidenced by previous sales in December 2013.  Lloyds banking group sold its Irish residential portfolio of about 2,000 mortgages to Apollo Global Management.  Apollo Global Management met the Central Bank and the Department and indicated clearly that it intended to voluntarily adopt the CCMA in managing the acquired loans.  Apollo Global Management believes following the CCMA is in the best interests of both parties, and it forms part of its core strategy.  I was delighted hear last night that the special liquidators had announced that an agreement had been reached with the phase two bidders for the IBRC mortgage book.  The agreement provides that, if successful, in acquiring the portfolio the phase two bidders will ensure that the relevant acquired mortgage loans are served in accordance with the terms of the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears.<\/p><p>The special liquidators were aware of the anxieties of mortgage holders, as we all are, and had noted the concerns expressed in recent weeks by the Minister for Finance and other Members of the Oireachtas.  I welcome this positive announcement and remind the House that the Government has always been clear about ensuring that mortgage holders retain the protection of the CCMA.  The Government's firm objective is to ensure that mortgage holders in Ireland are afforded the protection of the CCMA.  As the Government has previously stated, if it becomes evident that the voluntary application of the code in the case of IBRC and other non-regulated entities is not delivering the requisite protection for mortgage holders in arrears, it will bring forward the required legislation.  Work on draft legislation is already under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600035#KK00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1393427700,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I am delighted to hear that work on draft legislation is under way.

Suppose we had another Government or another Minister that was not as concerned about people's homes.  He or she might not act that quickly, so we do need more protection.  I seek clarification on one point because I do not understand this.  Perhaps the Minister of State would comment on why we should wait until an entity rows back from the code.  The Minister of State said in his response: \"I understand from the appearance of the special liquidator before the Oireachtas committee today that approximately 400 IBRC mortgage holders have repurchased their loans to date.\"  Is there a right to repurchase?

I seek the same protection I gave the Senator.  The Senator asked two questions, and I will reply to them, if I may.  It is important that we do not talk ourselves into an emergency for whatever reasons people might choose to do this for their own ends.  In regard to the question referred to in my opening remarks, my understanding is that the position has been set out by the liquidator that an offering has been made in circumstances of on-par mortgages.  I understand there are four special tranches within the loan book - performing, non-performing and two other categories that I cannot recall - so that provision has already been made.  Again, that has been in the public domain for quite some time and there is nothing particularly new in it.  The objective for the State - as the Senator well knows, because she supported Bill, as I did, when it came through both Houses - was to make sure that in so far as these are assets, the State maximises the return.  That is the only ambition of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  Second, in circumstances where people's homes are on the line, as is the case for this particular mortgage book, the objective is to make sure that we afford the same protections that apply to other mortgage holders through the CCMA.<\/p> <p>I greatly welcome that, as the special liquidator told the Senator today in the committee, after two weeks of intensive negotiation, two potential bidders for the next tranches of the loan book have confirmed they will sign up to that.  Were that sale to proceed - this is without prejudice until such a time as a sale does proceed - and were any difficulty to arise, the Minister stated last week, Ms Nolan stated today and I now am telling the Senator that the Government will proceed with legislation to ensure those people have the protection both of the code and, second, of the case law in which the High Court has ruled in circumstances where financial institutions have been attempting to move people out of their homes.  The case law from the High Court has been clear in respect of obtaining protection for people in a circumstance in which they have been engaging with the bank and have been attempting to work out a solution that is fair and equitable for the purpose of the institution and their own purpose.  This is case law, these are precedents and this is precisely what has happened in the Irish High Court by way of all these matters that have come to the attention of the courts.  This cannot be set aside either and, consequently, by way of the case law and the voluntary code, the Government hopes the protection will be given to these people because it does not want them to be adversely affected by the sale of the loan book.  While everyone accepts the State must of course maximise its take, because there are significant assets left over by way of the liquidation of the IBRC process, it must be done in a way that is fair for all.  The approach the Government has taken in this regard is correct and if further action is required, further action will be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600035#KK00700","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393428300,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600036#LL00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fish Farming","time":1393428300,"counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600036#LL00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1393428300,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600036#LL00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1393428300,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och d&oacute; as teacht isteach.  I am grateful that the Minister of State has come into the House to take this Adjournment matter.  I had actually tabled the Adjournment question before reading this morning's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i> which had a banner headline stating, &quot;Full-scale war over Galway fish farm&quot;.  It refers to the issue of the proposed farm off the island of Inis O&iacute;rr in Galway Bay, which would be a mega-fish farm.  The proposal is being advanced by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, to build what would be the biggest ever fish farm, perhaps in the world but certainly in Europe, and it has met with much disquiet from different sectors, ranging from those who are involved in the fishing industry, through local people with concerns regarding the impact on tourism, to those involved in ecology and so on.  Obviously, there are concerns regarding the viability and sustainability of such a project, as well as in respect of the science underlying the project and from where that has come.<\/p><p>  The full-scale war over the Galway fish farm to which the <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>alluded pertains to an ongoing interdepartmental debate in which one is told a full-scale war is under way between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Inland Fisheries Ireland, which is likely to determine the fate of this proposed fish farm.  It is reported the European Commission is investigating the reason it did not receive a scientific report from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that showed the amount of sea lice likely to come from such a farm could devastate much of the country's wild salmon and trout.  This report was drawn up by Inland Fisheries Ireland, which is responsible for protecting and developing inland fisheries and sea angling, as well as protecting wild salmon under the European Union's habitats directive.  What the Department did instead was to send a different study from another State agency, namely, the Marine Institute, which stated the danger would be small, at approximately 1%, compared with the 39% suggested by the report from Inland Fisheries Ireland.<\/p><p>  The <i>Irish Examiner<\/i> also reported that the Ombudsman is investigating this issue and was told by the Department that the Inland Fisheries Ireland report had many inaccuracies and fundamental errors and, had it been sent to the Commission, would have had a disastrous result for Ireland's reputation.  A number of questions arise from this report.  First, two State agencies are completely at odds with each other's findings on scientific issues on which one would imagine they could find common ground.  One must be wrong and the other right and if this is the case and one is completely wrong, is there a question mark hanging over the competence of the agencies that have drawn up the scientific reports?<\/p><p>  I note that the Marine Institute report also has been questioned by four independent scientists when published in the <i>Journal of Fish Diseases<\/i> and as a result, Ireland has a huge issue on the European stage in this regard.  In addition, I note a meeting took place recently between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and a man named Alf-Helge Aarskog, who runs the company Marine Harvest.  Many players in the industry would imagine that Marine Harvest is one of the prime suspects that might run the BIM-sponsored project.  While the licence proposal for the project is being developed by BIM, the intention is to license this mega-fish farm to a company to operate it.  There are probably only a small number of players globally who have the capacity to run such a project and one certainly would imagine that Marine Harvest would be in the running in this respect.  The aforementioned company already has a track record in Ireland of running quite a number of fish farms.<\/p><p>  My issue in this regard is there is an ongoing process seeking to have the licence either granted or not granted in respect of the fish farm off Inis Oirr in Galway Bay.  The project is being proposed by BIM, which falls under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Other Members of the Houses have questioned whether the Minister, who will sanction or not sanction a licence, should be in the position whereby he essentially is the proposer, on foot of being in charge of BIM, as well as being the adjudicator on the application at the same time.  While this certainly is an issue, during such a process one would imagine the Minister would refrain from meeting any of the key players in the process.  He certainly has refrained from meeting some of the detractors who are opposed to the project.  However, it appears quite strange that he and the Taoiseach could have a meeting with the head of Marine Harvest, who potentially could be the licenceholder in this case.  I question the efficacy of that meeting because, as the report that appeared in <i>Irish Examiner<\/i> stated, &quot;Aarskog, chief executive of Norwegian fish-farming giant Marine Harvest, jetted in especially for the Government face-time and is optimistic that it will bear fruit in the form of some new licences for Irish salmon farms&quot;.  Consequently, there is a question of interest in this regard and I hope the Minister of State will be able to clarify this point.<\/p><p>  In addition, there appears to be opposition from many fronts.  It appears to me there will be a major spat over this project and that people who are opposed to the fish farm, for all their different reasons, will fight this tooth and nail and it will end up before the European courts.  Therefore, we will have a major case on our hands in Europe and the State will end up fighting that case as far as the European Union courts, much money will be wasted and the people's concerns are quite genuine in many cases.  I am not completely opposed to the development of aquaculture but there are ways and means of doing this that are sustainable and which will create jobs.  While one certainly must consider the possibilities for the industry, the general consensus being reached around Galway Bay in particular is to the effect that this is the wrong project in the wrong place.  It is thought it will not work and will not have the full support of the local community and that at this point, the Minister should kick to touch and blow the project out of the water.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600036#LL00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1393428300,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine who is unable to attend.  I perceive aquaculture to be a crucial component of the Government's Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  To expand the production of Irish organic farmed salmon, I tasked BIM to investigate the creation of new fish farming production areas in deeper waters.  The placement of farms in deep waters is designed to ensure that there is no impact on Natura 2000 sites, no significant environmental or visual impact and no interference with migratory salmonids, wild sea fisheries, navigation or tourism interests.  BIM has estimated that just one of these production areas could generate more than &euro;100 million in exports per annum and create 350 direct jobs.  A further 150 jobs will be created indirectly in the service sector, supplying fish feed, netting, transportation and other services.<\/p><p>There always is a strict separation between the duty of the Minister to promote sustainable development of the industry, as evidenced by a wide range of initiatives he has taken in the last two years, including deep sea aquaculture, and his ministerial role as a decision-maker in respect of aquaculture licence applications.<\/p> <p>I regard this separation of duties as extremely serious and it is strictly observed at all times.<\/p><p>In 2012 BIM submitted an application to my Department for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of finfish near Inis O&iacute;rr in Galway Bay.  The application and its accompanying environmental impact statement are being considered under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act and the 1933 Foreshore Act, which provide for extensive consultation with stakeholders and also for a period of general public consultation.  The public consultation stage of the assessment process in respect of the application is closed and a total of 410 valid submissions were received by my Department.<\/p><p>All aspects of the Galway Bay application are currently being examined by my Department in conjunction with its scientific, engineering, technical and legal advisers . All submissions received as part of both the statutory consultation stage of the process and the general public consultation stage will form an integral part of my Department's consideration of the application.  It is important to note that the legislation provides for extensive consultation with stakeholders, including Inland Fisheries Ireland, which has responsibility for wild salmon stocks.  It is important for all parties to understand that, as the application is under active consideration as part of the statutory process, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the merits or otherwise of the application pending the completion of the formal assessment process by my Department.  The application process is governed by legislation and must not be subject to parallel discussions by me as Minister of State or my Department which could be misconstrued as indicating a predisposition by my Department in respect of the application.  No such predisposition exists and the formal assessment process will take into account and evaluate all observations received from stakeholders and the general public in respect of the application.  It must also be borne in mind that any person submitting a licence application to my Department has an entitlement in accordance with fair procedures to have the application fully considered in accordance with legislation.<\/p><p>The legislation also provides for appeal of the ministerial decision to the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, an independent authority for the determination of appeals against decisions of the Minister.  I assure the Senator that the public interest is well protected under the provisions of the relevant legislation and I am conscious of the importance of proceeding fully in line with statutory requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600036#LL00600","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393428900,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply on behalf of the Minister and I take on board all that he has said.

It would have been inappropriate, as this is one of the companies that could become the prime mover and shaker in the project.

LES providers work closely with the Department in areas and localities throughout the country to provide a much-needed and highly valued service to jobseekers, particularly those who face the greatest challenges in securing employment.  The Department values the work of the LES and intends to support and fund their work over coming months and years.

The allocation of additional resources to the activation of the long-term unemployed was the focus of an updated Pathways to Work policy statement published in July 2013.  Having examined various resourcing options, and taking note of developments in other states and the recommendations of the OECD, among others, the Government decided to contract for additional capacity from providers with expertise and experience in the provision of employment supports or related services.<\/p> <p>JobPath provision will not substitute or replace the work of the LESs but will augment and supplement their work and that of the Department's own Intreo centres.  In addition, the local development companies, which operate the LESs on behalf of the Department, are free to participate in JobPath, and this may provide a business development opportunity for them.  The Department does not intend to cease or change the work performed by the LESs once JobPath is in place.<\/p><p>The successor programme to the current local and community development programme, operated by the local development companies, will be procured in 2015 by the local community development committees, to be established in each local authority in line with the EU procurement directive 2004\/18\/EC.  Accordingly, I am advised by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that it will be necessary to operate a competitive process.  This process will be open to local development companies, other not-for-profit community groups in general and commercial firms that can deliver the services under the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014022600037#MM00500","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393429500,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, but I accept that he may not be in a position to speak on this matter in more detail.

The employees of the local employment services should be incorporated into the Department of Social Protection because they are doing the exact same work except for deciding on penalties against people who do not take up employment opportunities.  They are even paid by the Department.
