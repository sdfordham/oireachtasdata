Ireland has experienced a significant bulge in pupil enrolments in schools.  We have seen significant expansion in the rate of provision of new school places, which puts a high demand on the Department's capital budgets.  Since 2011 there have been 340 major school projects and over 120,000 new and replacement places have been provided.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's capital programme continues to address the challenges posed by a rapidly increasing school population.  To meet this demographic challenge, my Department&rsquo;s capital investment programme for the period 2016 to 2021 details the school projects that are being progressed through the architectural planning process.  The programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms in schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified.  We are building more schools and providing more school places than ever before.  This reflects the priority which the Government is giving to education.  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  It uses a geographical information system, GIS, to identify where there will be pressure to provide school places across the country.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources. <\/p>  <p>  The nationwide demographic exercises involving all school planning areas at primary and post-primary level which will determine where additional school accommodation will be needed in the future are ongoing.  My Department is factoring in the demographic exercises critical updated data, including updated enrolment data and up-to-date information on additional residential development from local authorities.  The provisional 2017-18 enrolment data have recently been made available and provide an important update on the available information which will inform the outcome of the demographic exercises.  It is anticipated that decisions based on the review will be announced in the coming weeks.  In addition, my Department is included in the prescribed bodies to which local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development and local area plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment and observations.  This enables local authorities to reserve future school sites in areas designated for proposed housing development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100003#A00600","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1517481000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I am glad that a review is taking place.

They are not for families starting off, rather they are for ready-made families, as a predecessor of mine on the education side in my party described them.  They are for families with grown up children who are moving to Ashbourne and Dunshaughlin, in particular.  In all my years as a Deputy, until the past few years, I never had to deal with an educational welfare officer to find a school place for a child.  Unfortunately, this is now a regular feature of my constituency work in Ashbourne, in particular.  It is not fair.  Families who have moved into the area find that there is not a single school place available if they have a child attending first, third or fifth class, despite welcome improvements in schools infrastructure delivery.  I am told by my colleagues in Fingal and Kildare that, notwithstanding further developments, the Department is already behind in providing new designated buildings.

Starting school is a major step in anybody's life, but if a person has an additional need and does not know what school he or she will attend it is difficult.  In some situations parents are being told that there is a school an hour or an hour and a half away and that transport will be provided.

A few weeks into that sort of system they are going to be so exhausted that they will not be able to learn, let alone reach their full potential.  There are 24 ASD units throughout Carlow and Kilkenny at primary level and 16 at post primary level.  They only cater for six children each, so that is a total of 144 in primary school and 96 at post-primary.  It is not adequate, certainly in my constituency.

There have been a large number of cases in the last few months where parents have been told that schools just do not have the space in September.  It is now February, and parents do not know where their children will be going to school in September.  That is completely unfair.

A career break is period of special leave and the main objectives of this scheme is for employers, wherever possible, to facilitate applicants in the areas of personal development, voluntary service overseas, to accompany a spouse or partner on a diplomatic or military posting, for education, public representation, child care or dependent care, and self-employment.<\/p>  <p>  In response to reported difficulties by schools with regard to recruiting substitute teachers, my Department issued notification on 26 January that it was suspending the restrictions regarding substitution limits for those on a career break for the current school year.  Prior to this decision the limits were 90 days in primary schools and 300 hours in post primary schools.  The notification also reminded employers that &ldquo;in considering applications for career breaks, the welfare and educational needs of the pupils shall take precedence over all other considerations and accordingly, must take account of the availability of appropriate qualified replacement teachers\".

He has met Deputies who have suggestions and concerns.  I suppose I need to outline the position.  It is a significant operation.  It is managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  Some 115,000 children, including almost 12,000 children with special educational needs, are transported in 4,500 vehicles to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country each day.  These vehicles cover approximately 100 million km each year.  This service was provided at a total cost of almost &euro;190 million in 2017.  The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  Children are generally eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school.  I think the relevant distance at primary level is 3.2 km and at secondary level is 4.8 km.  It is important to note that all eligible children are accommodated under the terms of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from commitments in the programme for Government, a review of the concessionary charges and rules element of the school transport scheme has been undertaken.  The review, which was published in December 2016, made recommendations on the charges and the rules elements of the concessionary school transport scheme.  The recommended course of action in respect of the charges for concessionary school transport was to continue with the current policy of imposing charges in respect of those in receipt of concessionary places.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, agreed with this recommendation on the basis that those applying for concessionary transport are making a conscious decision to do so, understand that they are not eligible for school transport and understand the implications of this choice at the time of application.  The report also recommended that the number of concessionary places should be reduced in line with the rules introduced in 2012 on a phased basis.  Previous plans to advance this option were put on hold, pending the completion of the review.  After considering the review and discussing the matter with the cross-party working group which was established to feed into the review, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, decided there should be no planned programme of downsizing in the coming years, other than in line with normal operational decisions under the current scheme.

The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has been very forthcoming and receptive to meetings with all of us.  He indicated in response to a Topical Issue I raised in this Chamber that a small amount of additional money would enable him to provide a better service to many people.  The Minister has quite rightly pointed out that significant resources are invested in the school transport scheme, which is particularly important in rural Ireland.  We can talk about introducing various schemes with the aim of regenerating rural Ireland, but if we do not have a satisfactory school transport scheme there will be a substantial deficit in rural Ireland.  Everyone who has the privilege of representing a rural constituency - my colleagues, Deputies Niall Collins and Eugene Murphy, represent constituencies that are much like my constituency - knows that many families decide to set up homes in rural parishes on the basis of access to schools and availability of transport to primary and secondary schools.  I appreciate that there will always be difficulties in any overall general scheme that is based on boundaries.  There needs to be some flexibility in decision-making at local level.  As we all know, changes in the old catchment areas that were assigned to schools that closed in the past can mean that rural communities fall into different towns or villages.  In cases in which older siblings went to certain post-primary centres, flexibility is needed to ensure younger siblings are not denied the transport services that were available to other family members.

In recent years, the use of Google maps when people have been applying for school transport online has resulted in distances being measured using roads that are not capable of carrying motor cars or school transport buses.  It is that context that I am talking about local flexibility and local knowledge.  I fully appreciate that a scheme cannot be designed to suit every family.  We should have flexibility.  Past patterns of attendance should be taken into account.  That washes out of the system anyway as the years go on.

There seem to be more laws to protect the rights of the institution over those of the young person.  I sent a question to the Minister on 18 January on RSE being delivered by Accord, a Catholic organisation that does not, for example, deal with same-sex couples in marriage counselling services, despite the outcome of a massive referendum.

There is investment by the Department to make sure the teachers who deliver the programme have the skills to do so.  That was just one year of the programme's activities.  As I emphasised in my initial reply, there are no options in the delivery of the programme.  Schools cannot opt out of certain parts of the sexuality education programme being delivered.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the use of outside organisations, there are very clear guidelines from the Department which are included in circulars to primary and post-primary schools.  They state that where an outside speaker is engaged by a school, he or she should be engaged in the context of delivering a planned and comprehensive programme in the school, that he and or she should not be brought in to replace the school programme but to enhance it, that it is the responsibility of the school to ensure outside speakers are aware of the school policy and that the full content of the curriculum is delivered.

The programmes have been receiving an endowment from the State, even though they are denominational and only deal with young people who are Catholic.  We also find that boys' schools do not provide sex education as much as girls' schools.  Girls are meant to be the gatekeepers when it comes to sexuality.  There is an ethos which is based on waiting until the time is right; it is not an all-encompassing view of sexuality but tends to be about watching out for this and not doing it.  There is a clear link between quality sex education and lower levels of crisis pregnancies.

This followed the decision by SIRO, a joint venture between the ESB and Vodafone, to withdraw late last year.  Three of the most experienced and established utility companies in the State have opted out of the Government process to provide broadband infrastructure to 542,000 homes and business premises dotted throughout rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In 2011, the Fine Gael-led Government promised that broadband would be rolled out to every premises in the State by 2016.  That did not happen.  Yesterday's announcement signalled the collapse of the Government's plan.  When negotiating a programme for Government, in which the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, played a key role, the Government indicated that a deal would be done and a contractor would be appointed by June 2017.  That date slipped.  Virtually every date that the Government has set since talking about a national broadband plan has been missed.<\/p>  <p>  When asked repeatedly in the House to outline the projected contract signing date and the dates on which work would begin and be completed, the Minister dodged the questions and instead waxed lyrical about all of the broadband that was being rolled out throughout Ireland, failing to mention that it was being rolled out by commercial operators based on their commercial decisions and, in many cases, duplicated a pre-existing service in densely populated areas.<\/p>  <p>  From his former role as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the T&aacute;naiste knows the profile and character of rural Ireland.  He knows the kind of people whom he has met on his visits there.  He knows the farming communities, the small communities and the small businesses that support farming and require access to high-speed broadband.  He knows the people who live in rural Ireland and the students who come home at the weekend or every night and need access to broadband in order to pursue their studies.  People living in rural Ireland need access to broadband to conduct their banking and for their basic life pursuits, but they have been continuously deprived of it and have been sold a pup time after time.<\/p>  <p>  When Vodafone and the ESB pulled out of the process, it should have raised a red flag in the Department concerned, but it did not.  The withdrawal of Eir should have signalled a crisis in the process, but it has not.  Amazingly, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has welcomed the clarity provided by the withdrawal of Eir.  He believes that shovels will be in the ground more quickly and that the project will now be delivered on budget and ahead of schedule.  What cybergalaxy is the Minister living in?  The situation is farcical.  Months of detailed negotiations are still to take place between the remaining bidder and the Government on pricing and technical matters, so there is no guarantee that a deal can be arrived at or if the deal proposed by the Government will remain viable for the 25 years of the contract.  The last thing the 542,000 homes and businesses need is another false dawn or, worse still, a contract that collapses a few years into operation.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il proposed that this infrastructure should have been built and owned by the State.  The Minister rejected that proposition, claiming that it would create significant delays to the project.  The Government put its faith in the market, but the market has turned its back on the Government.  In light of what has happened, will the Government now consider changing the nature of the tender so that the State will take responsibility for building and owning this infrastructure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100012#K01100","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1517486400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>First, the Government is acutely aware of the pressures in rural Ireland in terms of the need for broadband access.

I know the responsibility the Government has to ensure that people in rural Ireland as well as people in urban centres can access the information and the opportunity that the Internet provides.  They need speed to be able to do that and, by and large, delivering that speed requires fibre, which is exactly what the Government is committed to delivering by effectively State sponsoring the roll-out of broadband to the 500,000 or so households that currently do not have it.  We are going to see that through.<\/p>  <p>  We have been through a very complex tendering process to get there in terms of finalising a tender that will last for 25 years.

In 1994, an agreement was reached between the CI&Eacute; employees and the company to amalgamate five pension schemes, thereby allowing it to remove a potential &euro;73 million pension deficit from its book.  In return, employees were given certain assurances, the first of which was that the board of CI&Eacute; would guarantee the solvency of the pension schemes each year.  The second commitment given was that there would be regular post-retirement increases, but no specific rate was given.<\/p>  <p>  The company stuck to those commitments until 2009 when it failed to provide sufficient funding to ensure the solvency of the schemes in that year and in the following years.  This was against the advice tendered by the company's actuary.  Since then, the board of CI&Eacute; has underfunded the pension scheme to the tune of around &euro;80 million.  The assurance given by the Minister states: \"In every year there shall be a contribution from the board to a fund of such sum as the board after consulting the actuary determines to be necessary to support and maintain the solvency of the fund.\"  Despite this, neither the Government nor the Minister has intervened to ensure that CI&Eacute; adheres to that order.  A blind eye has been turned to it.<\/p>  <p>  Not only has the company underfunded the pension scheme, by extension it has jeopardised the solvency of both CI&Eacute; pension scheme funds.  This issue was raised by the NBRU and SIPTU.  Yesterday, I proposed to the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport that we invite the unions in to discuss these issues with the committee.  It has agreed to do that.  We will hear the unions' side of the story this month.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the T&aacute;naiste that to remember that we are talking about people's pensions.  Last year, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was very unhappy with the prospect of being a lot poorer because a large part of his pension from Independent News &amp;amp; Media was being cut.  He blasted the proposals at that time as very unfair and unreasonable.  I sincerely hope he sees the seriousness of this issue for the thousands of workers in CI&Eacute;.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and Department have serious questions to answer.  Once again, it comes back to accountability and oversight pure and simple.  It is also an issue which has been known about by successive Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport, one of whom is the current Taoiseach and another of whom is the Minister for Finance.  It is not an issue the Government can ignore the because CI&Eacute; has a legal obligation to adhere to the Minister's directive.<\/p>  <p>  When was the underfunding of the pension scheme brought to the attention of the Minister?

There are hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses across the country currently without access to high-speed broadband.  The tendering process collapsed yesterday when Eir withdrew, the second bidder to do so.  A tendering competition with one bidder is not a procurement process and I say that as the person who as Minister brought the last three procurement directives through the European Parliament.  The notion that the Minister would now portray this latest development as a good thing is delusional at best and cynically misleading at worst.  There is only one bidder so, by definition, the State now has no choice as to who will deliver the national broadband plan to 500,000 homes and businesses and it will only happen if the price of Enet can be afforded.<\/p>  <p>  The incompetent way in which this has been handled leaves the State over a barrel on price and the timeframe of implementation.  In effect, the country is now snookered and the Minister and his Department have lost control of the process.  The delays in rolling out the plan have allowed the dominant, near-monopoly player to increase its market share.  The original basis of the plan was critically undermined when the Minister allowed Eir to cherry pick over 300,000 homes in April 2017.  Was there an evaluation of the plan at that time, or of the consequences of that decision?  If one removes all the lucrative parts of any contract one should not be surprised when private businesses, which already dominate the market, decide they already have what they want and walk away from the process.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, must take responsibility for this disaster.  He managed to turn what had been a solid process into a mess, all in less than two years.  SIRO, a joint venture between the ESB and Vodafone, withdrew from the tendering process in September stating there was no longer a business case once those 300,000 premises had been removed.  That only left Eir and Enet.  The Minister has facilitated a market grab by the largest player in the field, which already has a dominant position.  Through the delays in delivering the plan, Eir has been able to build an even more dominant position and undermine the prospect of a credible roll-out plan.<\/p>  <p>  The process over the past two years has driven credible providers out of the market.  Yesterday's news leaves more than 500,000 homes and businesses with no prospect of viable connectivity in the years to come.  Will the Government apologise to those who will now wait years for broadband, with no clear timeframe for when they will get it?  Is it not now the case that the State is totally beholden to one provider which can name its price, determine the timeframe and laugh at the Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100014#M00900","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1517487600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>The Deputy signed off on this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100014#M01000","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1517487600,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The Government has demolished it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100014#M01100","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1517487600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>The Deputy should let me answer his question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100014#M01200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1517487600,"counter":216,"content":"<p>The process had been robust but the Government has banjaxed it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100014#M01300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1517487600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100014#M01400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1517487600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Now that it is not politically convenient, the Deputy is not sticking with it.

In the main, the focus has been on the economy and preparing the Irish economy for the impact.  We have had so many discussions around business, agriculture, jobs, the Single Market, the customs union, the common travel area and how the Good Friday Agreement is being undermined.  I look at all that and the drive, energy, work and commitment.  I know it is very necessary but I also look at what is happening in the north inner city where I am looking for even a fraction of that drive, energy and commitment on the issues that have seen such an escalation in violence, a callous indifference to life and the neglect of those communities and their way of life.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard comments that this violence and the number of murders in a small area would not be tolerated if it was to happen in the leafy suburbs of Dublin or Cork.  I suppose it would not be tolerated but that is missing the point.  The point is that it is not happening there and it would not happen there.  It is because those leafy suburbs were not neglected in the way the communities in the north inner city have been over many years and through many Governments when one looks at the difference between the areas in terms of housing, infrastructure, environment, the health of the residents, jobs, careers, disposable income, access to a variety of social activities and progression in education.  I would ask how much open drug dealing is happening on the streets of those leafy suburbs.  It is because of that difference that the inner city has been a fertile ground for the drug industry and all the mayhem, chaos and violence it brings.  It is telling that it took a string of murders to bring attention and focus on those issues in the north inner city.  <\/p>  <p>  I know it will not change overnight and I acknowledge the work that has started and the work of the garda&iacute; and their successes through their intelligence gathering but the reality is that there was another murder on Tuesday night, the evening before the funeral of another murder victim.  I think back to the first murder, which took place during the last election, but now it is almost like \"oh, another murder in the north inner city, more of the gangland feud\" and then it is forgotten about until the next one.  It is likely that there will be more.  The residents of the north inner city, particularly young people, teenagers and senior citizens, deserve the same respect as those who live in those leafy suburbs and they also deserve the same right to a peaceful existence enjoyed by people in other areas.  This will not happen unless there is a real urgency and a real commitment to tackle those issues that have brought about the chaos we are experiencing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100015#N03400","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1517488200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Not for the first time, I agree with an awful lot of what the Deputy said.  The State's response here has to be across multiple different areas and initiatives.  From a justice and policing point of view, the type of criminal behaviour we have seen again this week has no place in a civilised society and will not be tolerated by the Government.  We are putting resources in place to ensure that this is the case.  Operation Hybrid has been established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to co-ordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and to address public safety concerns about community safety.  Operation Hybrid benefits from significant support by armed support units.  If we look at the result of that Garda response as of 21 January last, we see 72 arrests;13 charges in total, of which ten related to murder investigations and three of which related to other related offences; 34 firearms seized; in the region of 260 searches; and over 15,000 lines of inquiry conducted with more than 50,000 high-visibility checkpoints.  There is a significant step up in terms of Garda presence.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that this is not enough in terms of the State's collective response.  This is why under the previous Taoiseach, who felt very strongly about this issue, as does the current Taoiseach, we set up a north-east inner-city initiative to which the Deputy contributed in terms of the thinking on that chaired by Michael Stone.  The board includes representatives from the community and business sectors as well as key Government Departments and agencies.  The board has met every month since it was established last June and will shortly publish its 2017 report, including a comprehensive detailed report on spending across multiple areas from education to youth development to community development to sports facilities and all the other things that are a real deficit for communities living in this part of Dublin versus communities in other parts of Dublin.  That is a gap and deficit that this Government wants to overcome.  We will put very significant resources in place to try to do that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100015#N03500","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1517488200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>In respect of the Good Friday Agreement and the work of the British Irish Council on substance misuse, Ireland is the lead on that so I again ask that this work continue and that it be seen as a priority because with all this discussion about moveable or flexible borders, one wonders how the whole tracking of guns, money and drugs will be monitored.  I go back to the point about inequality.  During last week's Leaders' Questions, I referred to the report from the World Economic Forum, which spoke about the income inequality in Ireland and the soaring wealth inequality.  It is that inequality that has led to the social deprivation and social neglect.  I really feel for young people.<\/p><p>Young people will not be able to realise their potential because they are living in an environment where they are open to exploitation and manipulation.

It is probably true to say there has never been better co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI than there is today.  We need to ensure through Brexit and post Brexit that co-operation is maintained and sustained so that vulnerable people who are being targeted by criminal gangs are protected North and South, and that the movement of gangs across the Border is addressed in as comprehensive a way as we can address it from a security point of view.<\/p>  <p>  The Government does not disagree with the concerns here.

They say Romanian workers are being paid less than the sectoral employment agreement rates.  This stuff is rampant.  Agencies are being set up that are not registered, paying people less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100016#O02000","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1517488800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I call the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100016#O02100","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1517488800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>When will that legislation come in to secure the rights of workers so that they are not being exploited and abused?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100016#O02200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1517488800,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I call the T&aacute;naiste on promised legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100016#O02300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1517488800,"counter":289,"content":"<p>The legislation the Deputy is referring to is the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and it is due to be taken in the House in the week after next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100016#O02400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1517488800,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I ask a follow-up question to the Minister for Justice and Equality on his area of responsibility.

He was murdered because of his name and as part of an ongoing feud that has, for the last number of years, dominated certain parts of this city.  Six days ago, there was another example of this feud and its damaging influence when gunshots were fired outside of the National Stadium on South Circular Road.  Two men were injured.  It was thought that one of the targets was a 40 year-old man.  The Garda stated that this is part of the ongoing feud, the Kinahan-Hutch dispute that has now been going on for two and a half years.  Then, two days ago, we saw another brutal murder.  A man was brutally murdered on the North Strand simply because of his association, it appears, with the Hutch family.  He too was only 27 years of age.<\/p>  <p>  These murders are brutal and cowardly for very many reasons.  First, they are brutal and cowardly because, as happened with the man who was murdered 11 days ago, people are lured to places against their will.  They are brutal and cowardly because people attack victims from behind as they are getting into a car and shoot them in the head.  They are brutal and cowardly because individuals are targeted because of their name, or because of their friendship with a particular family.  Most of all, they are brutal and cowardly because of the damaging and traumatic influence and impact the violence is having on the community in the north inner city, a very proud community that wishes, like any other, to ensure that its children are brought up in a safe and peaceful environment.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  Over the last two and a half years or so, approximately 15 people have been murdered as a result of this feud.  It is simply unacceptable and we, as legislators and as politicians in this House, have to re-emphasise consistently that it is unacceptable.  I know there is no one, easy solution to this problem.  I know it is ongoing criminal activity that can only be resolved through investment in local communities, resources on the ground and responses by the Legislature to issues that must be raised.  They are the responsibility of different groups throughout society.  However, one of the entities - in fact, the entity - that has the most power to effect that change and fight this criminal activity is the Government.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is the Minister in this Government responsible for ensuring that the people of this city, the people of the north inner city, in particular, are kept safe.<\/p>  <p>  I want to know what the Minister for Justice and Equality is going to do about of this.  Something has to be done about it.  I want to know if, since he has the power, the Minister proposes to bring forward changes to the law.  I was particularly concerned when it was reported recently that the armed response unit and the special detective unit may have been subject to cutbacks.  We need to ensure that the Garda presence in the north inner city, which has been very effective over the last two years or so, is maintained.  We cannot just take our foot off the pedal in the hope that this problem will go away.  It has not gone away.  It is still there.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the Minister is the central authority in the State for matters pertaining to extradition.  I know it is an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but why is it, if individuals are masterminding these criminal acts from outside the State, that no steps are being taken to bring them to justice within this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100023#Z00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1517493000,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I wish to thank Deputy O'Callaghan for raising this issue of great seriousness in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I will be addressing this issue from a criminal justice perspective, but of course it is important to note that the Government's focus on removing organised criminals' grip on areas is not confined to a criminal justice approach.  A multiplicity of supports are involved across a range of Government Departments and agencies.<\/p>  <p>  The fatal shooting that took place earlier this week in Dublin's North Strand is currently under active investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The House will appreciate that the manner in which particular investigations are conducted is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team.  I have no role in such investigations.  The shooting occurred within days of the brutal killing of Derek Hutch near Cloverhill Prison and the non-fatal shootings which took place outside the National Stadium on the South Circular Road on 26 January this year.  I wish to assure the House that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also conducting a comprehensive investigation into both of these incidents.  I wish it well with its endeavours and inquiries, and I join the garda&iacute; in calling for anybody with any information to report that potential evidence to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  I want to be clear.  This type of criminal behaviour has no place in a civilised society.  It will not be tolerated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this Government.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has faced down this type of threat in the past and will do so again.  I note that there has been some commentary this week to the effect that the State provides fewer resources to the policing of organised crime north of the River Liffey, or that little is done to stop gangland figures from killing each other.  Such assertions are ill-informed and without foundation.  In the first instance, the Garda has, in fact, prevented a huge amount of violence and crime in recent times.  Successes of this kind go under the radar and are not reported on the news on a daily basis.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important to note that the Garda, supported by significant resources allocated to it by this Government, has made important progress in tackling the insidious threat of organised crime, particularly in the north Dublin inner city area.  Operation Hybrid has been established to co-ordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address public concerns about community safety.  It benefits from significant support by armed support units.  As of 21 January, this response has resulted in 72 arrests, 13 charges in total, 34 firearms seized, 260 searches, 15,260 lines of inquiry conducted and more than 50,450 high-visibility checkpoints implemented with active support from the armed support units.  A significant about of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic and forensic evidence has also been examined.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the conviction earlier this week in the Special Criminal Court of Eamonn Cumberton for the murder of Michael Barr in the Sunset House pub in April 2016, and the convictions of two other men apprehended in possession of a large number of firearms, were feud-related.  They came about as a result of concentrated efforts by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle the perpetrators involved in this ongoing feud.  We have also seen reports of a series of very significant drug seizures by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as important seizures of significant banking information used to fuel the activities of organised criminals.  These seizures have significantly hampered the ability of these gangs to operate.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not allow these criminals to prevail.  It will ensure that the perpetrators of these heinous crimes will be apprehended and brought to justice as quickly as possible.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that these endeavours will continue to be fully supported by this Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100023#Z00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1517493000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister that this is not simply a criminal justice issue, but it is predominantly a criminal justice issue.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is the person within the Government who is responsible for criminal justice and for the resourcing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  With respect to the Minister, it is not sufficient for him to simply state that he wishes the Garda well in these endeavours.  The Garda needs more than to be wished well by Government.  It needs to be given full and adequate resources to ensure that this vicious feud can be stopped, so that the people of the north inner city can be protected.  If, as the Minister said, the following is incorrect, I would like to see his statistics on the matter but it was reported that armed patrol units in the north inner city have been cut by 30% and that the covert backup by the special detective unit has also been cut.  If that is so, it needs to be reversed. <\/p><p>This is not the time to cut back on Garda resources just as the feud appears to be reigniting.  Everyone in the House has a responsibility which the Minister has recognised to ensure the people of the north inner city will not be treated as second-class citizens when it comes to their protection.  They are being exposed to a vicious, violent feud that is having a traumatic effect on families and young people in the vicinity.  We have a responsibility to ensure we face up to it and the best way to do that is to ensure the Garda has the resources it needs.  I ask the Minister to meet assistant Garda commissioner Leahy to ensure he is properly informed on whether adequate resources are being provided for the force.

Garda operations in Dublin's north inner city are underpinned by increased resources made available to the force by the Government.  In budget 2018 approximately &euro;100 million has been allocated for Garda overtime to support ongoing operations such as Operation Hybrid.  In 2016, at the request of the Garda Commissioner, funding was approved by the previous Government for the setting up of a dedicated armed support unit in the Dublin metropolitan region.  It is now operational on a 24\/7 basis.<\/p>  <p>  The allocation and management of Garda resources, including the overtime budget, as the Deputy will be aware, are the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner, having due regard to operational needs.  I have no role in that regard.  It is a matter for Garda management to utilise the resources made available to it by the Government in the most efficient and effective manner, while also ensuring high visibility policing in communities to tackle the scourge of gangland crime head on.  Garda&iacute; are active on the international stage through Interpol and Europol and on a bilateral basis with other European states.  Action is well under way to ensure that if there is sufficient evidence, those responsible will be brought before the courts.  The Government has enacted legislation to target criminal activities further, including the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2016 which provides additional powers for the Garda, in particular to immediately seizure assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them from being disposed of.<\/p>  <p>  While the allocation of Garda personnel is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, I am advised that since January 2017, a number of new and additional garda&iacute; have been assigned to Store Street, Mountjoy and Bridewell Garda stations.  Furthermore, work is progressing towards the reopening of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station, with funding for the project having been made available in the mid-term capital review.  A dedicated community policing office is also based in Store Street Garda station for the north central division to ensure the issues highlighted by the local community and stakeholders will be dealt with in an effective manner.<\/p>  <p>  All of the endeavours we have discussed will continue to be supported fully by me and my Government colleagues.

I thank the three Deputies for raising it and expressing their concerns.<\/p>  <p>  The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and with independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This is clearly what they and everybody in this House want.  We also have patients who are in genuine need of residential care, either on a long-stay or short-stay basis.  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St Finbarr's Hospital.  The hospital is part of the older persons social care directorate and one of 24 hospitals in the Cork Kerry Community Hospitals Group. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has worked with the Irish Nursing and Midwives Organisation in recent months on staffing levels and ratios at the hospital.  HSE management has undertaken a review of staffing in consultation with the nursing unions, with a view to ensuring safe and adequate staffing levels and a skills mix to meet the care needs of the residents in long-term care and the rehabilitation wards.  It included a review of resource management, the skills mix and service costs.  The executive proposes to reconfigure the staffing levels and skills mix at the hospital to provide for optimum use of approved staffing resources and a reduction in the over-reliance on overtime and agency costs.  The current proposal, if implemented, will potentially provide for a reduction of 16.5 nursing whole-time equivalents and 5.1 health care assistant whole-time equivalents.  This will eliminate the reliance on the use of agency staff and maximise overall direct employment within the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has assured the Department that there are no plans to reduce the number of directly employed staff at the hospital and certainly there are no plans for redundancies.  The Department understands the executive has demonstrated that staffing levels in terms of WTEs have increased in the past few years and that HSE management is satisfied that the reconfigured staffing levels will be adequate to provide the service being delivered.<\/p><p>The engagement between management, staff, the INMO and SIPTU is underpinned by the terms of the national public service stability agreement.  Agreement was not reached locally and notification was issued for the commencement of industrial action. The matter progressed to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, conciliation services and the parties met in December 2017.  Following subsequent correspondence and discussions, an interim arrangement was put in place without prejudice to either party&rsquo;s position and this has provided for the deferral of any industrial action, with the agreement to engage on the change programme as soon as possible.  This was in place until yesterday, 31 January.<\/p> <p> A conciliation conference has been organised by the WRC for 8 February 2018.  Management has agreed to an extension of the interim arrangements up to and including the date of the WRC conciliation conference and to not later than Thursday, 15 February which will allow a reasonable period for the parties to consider any proposal emerging from the WRC process.  This issue is being addressed by the HSE and key stakeholders through an agreed process, and officials from the Department will continue to monitor this situation carefully.

The Minister came back promptly with factual information on the numbers attending and so on.  I appreciate that.  However, my question was whether she had been made aware of the issue and what alternative steps she will take.  The reason I asked that question is that we have received very urgent representations, primarily from the most important people, namely, the parents of the children who will be affected.  That is more than 40 families.  Unusually for them, people from the legal profession - solicitors and barristers - have got together to say that this is an essential service.  They are publicly on the record as saying that this service must be kept.  Therapists and various other professionals who use the service have also made representations to us in respect of this service.<\/p>  <p>  This service was set up in 2007.  It has been there for more than ten years.  It has had two positive evaluations, one in 2008 and one in 2016.  Both pointed to the essential nature of the service and to the positive effect on children.  I do not have much time to speak on this but I will bring the Minister's attention to the conclusions of the 2016 report, where figures are given.  It says that the service enhances the positive relationships between parents and children and so on.<\/p><p>They cannot do without this service.  If it is closed, 40 or more families will be affected.  Primarily, children will not see their fathers.  It is run on a shoestring budget of approximately &euro;80,000 per year and has four staff, one of whom is full-time.<\/p> <p> We have spoken to the directors.  The only difficulty seems to relate to the governance structure and providing cover at the weekend.  Problems seldomly arise at the weekend.  The house costs nothing because it is in Tusla's ownership.  It will remain open and has ample space for the other services provided therein.  A number of Deputies met the directors last week.<\/p> <p> People with legal and psychological care backgrounds are happy to serve on the board, but they have never been contacted.  Last Monday, the directors confirmed to us that it was an essential service and they wanted it kept open at all costs.<\/p> <p> To repeat myself, it is run on a shoestring budget and there have been no problems on the ground.

It is fine when there is a large professional staff, but it would be a tragedy if important services were lost because people felt that there was too much governance and not enough backup to support it.

I welcome the opportunity to clarify the circumstances surrounding Time 4 Us and the wider picture of child contact centres.  We all agree that the long-term goal is a quality service delivered to all children in all areas.  However, it is important to ensure that any service delivered to children and families is of a high quality.  Services must be appropriate to local needs and sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  Child contact centres are safe, friendly and neutral places where children can spend time with the parent or parents with whom they do not live.  The centre provides a child-centred environment that allows the child to continue a relationship with the parent at the child's pace and in his or her own way, usually through play and child-centred activities.<\/p>  <p>  Services of this nature are used by children and families in a wide range of circumstances, some of which can be difficult or contentious.  These centres may also cater to children whose parents are separated and cannot agree contact arrangements.  Children in the care of Tusla, who need support to have access with their families, also use the service.  I paid attention to Deputy Connolly outlining aspects of that in this case.<\/p>  <p>  Time 4 Us was established in 2007.  The service's purpose is to provide parents who do not live with their children with a facility where they can spend time together.  A total of 41 families are currently using the service, 36 of which were referred by the courts or private family law services.  I appreciate that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's concerns relate to the funding of this service, but I will draw his attention to the additional reasons given by the board of directors for closing the service.  These include significant challenges in terms of board membership and sustainable governance, which Deputy Connolly referenced.  Several members of the board wish to retire in the coming years and the board has struggled to find suitable replacements.  It has also struggled to provide staff for weekend cover, which is a time of high demand.<\/p>  <p>  Time 4 Us operates an on-call rota at the weekend to provide support to the staff in the centres.  It previously received funding from the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Justice and Equality as well as from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, SVP.  In 2016, the service's main funding came from grants from Tusla and the Galway City &amp;amp; County Childcare Committee, with the remainder coming from the SVP.  However, the funding from the SVP has now ceased.<\/p>  <p>  A decision has been made by the board of directors to cease the service on 31 March.  Tusla will work with the board to identify alternative supports that current service users can avail of in the local area.  It is important to ensure that the services provided for access and contact are safe, of the highest quality and sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018020100026#CC00500","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1517494800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I must reluctantly say that the Minister's answer was disappointing.
