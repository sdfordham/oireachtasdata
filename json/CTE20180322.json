I understand a report was completed, at least in draft form, and sent to the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  It then had to be legally proofed.  I do not know whether changes have become necessary as a result of communications between the legal representatives of the HEA and the author of the report which was submitted to the HEA in November 2017.  With April approaching, I am informed that it could be several months before the report is published.  I am concerned by the length of time it is taking to publish it.  As someone who received at least 14 protected disclosures about some of the issues addressed in the report, I am aware that its author met dozens of people in Waterford Institute of Technology.  Complications may have arisen because the report may make adverse references to persons other than those who made disclosures, provided information or were interviewed.  However, I do not know if that is the case because we have not had sight of the draft report.<\/p> <p>  I am also aware that at one point the Comptroller and Auditor General was considering whether to produce a report on the FeedHenry aspect of the issue.

I believed that if we had something additional to add, we could then make a decision, but, given the time, it is probably better that we press ahead with the report.

Item No. 1144C, correspondence received from Deputy Marc MacSharry, refers to this correspondence.  The individual in question is calling for four things: first, that we critically review his latest correspondence; second, that we request cumulative officially reported expenditure on the subject of litigation in 2017; third, that we confirm that the Comptroller and Auditor General's branch, in all relevant years, namely, from 2007 to 2017, inclusive, tested under the money-laundering legislation, as applicable, in the case of St. Angela's College and, if not, that such testing be undertaken, as appropriate, this being a matter for Mr. McCarthy; and, fourth, that we recommend that an audit of corporate governance and management be undertaken by St. Angela's College Sligo Limited.

The individual has forwarded a number of solicitors' letters in which a number of allegations are made.  If he believes the allegations, he should pursue the matter further through the courts.  If he believes there are criminal actions, he should report them to the Garda.  That is not our function.  For our part and with his agreement, I propose that we forward the correspondence to the HEA for whatever action it deems appropriate.  Beyond that, I suggest we do not involve ourselves further.  We are not asking the HEA to do anything; we are forwarding the material to it for its attention for any action it chooses to take.  We can also expect every attempt to be made by public bodies to reduce expenditure on litigation.  The individual in question has asked for details of expenditure on legal fees in 2017.  I propose that we do not go there.  He can take up the matter through whatever other channels are available.  It is essentially a legal dispute and we are not going to get into it any further.  I have made the committee's view clear.  We will forward the material to the HEA.  The individual in question has the option of going to the courts.  It is a legal dispute that has been in the courts before.  If there are criminal matters involved, the individual in question has the option of going to the Garda, but the Committee of Public Accounts is not the appropriate body to take the matter further.  We are concluding our correspondence on the issue on that basis.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item No. 1139C  is correspondence received from Professor Patrick O'Shea, president, University College Cork, enclosing information requested by the committee on the appointment process for the chief operations officer in the Tyndall National Institute.  Can we note the correspondence and forward a copy to the individual who raised the matter?  It is an employment matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item No. 1148C  is correspondence received from Deputy Niamh Smyth.  It concerns the issue of corporate governance at Creative Ireland and the allocation of funding for various events and festivals.  I propose, in the first instance, that we write to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for a response which we will discuss when we receive it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item No. 1149C  is correspondence received from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, enclosing information requested by the committee on the Irish Horse Welfare Trust, an organisation which is based in County Wicklow.  Can we note the item and forward a copy to the individual who raised the matter?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item No. 1158C is correspondence received from an individual who alleges the unlimited waste of taxpayers' money to harass her family.  She has copied correspondence to the committee and been in touch with the health committee.  The substantive matter seems to relate to the taking into custody by the Garda of her children on two occasions, in 2013 and 2016, as a result of a court order.  It is not within the remit of the committee to consider court decisions.  I propose that we write to the individual in question to suggest she consider obtaining legal advice on her options.  I also propose that we write to state our consideration of the matter is now closed.  We certainly cannot revisit matters dealt with in the Family Court.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item No. 1159C  is correspondence received from an individual concerning what he describes as the SIPTU-F&Aacute;S slush fund.  He questions why the committee is not investigating the matter which has been ongoing for five or six years at the committee.  It was considered by the previous committee.  There is also an ongoing investigation into the alleged misappropriation of grant funds and the issue remains within the remit of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  The last committee submitted the matter to the Garda to investigate whether there was fraud involved.  This was communicated to the individual in question last November.  I propose that we write to him to state we do not propose to pursue the matter further and that he not circulate further correspondence on it to the committee.  If at some point the investigation is concluded by the Garda and there are matters arising from it that are relevant to the committee, we may return to the issue at that stage.  It has been handed over to the Garda and we are not getting involved at this stage.  Is that agreed?

The findings of the Console report, which we might discuss in the work programme, were so bad that the report itself said that it pointed to potentially systemic problems within the HSE, that they were not just with the funded organisations but also in the relationship between those organisations and the HSE.  That was not accepted by the director general, yet almost monthly we seem to have problems with funding in these organisations.  This is serious because there is a potential conflict of interest.  The report itself cites that issue.  There are also questions around credit card expenditure.  This has all come about on foot of an internal audit by the HSE.  Is that audit public?  Has it been published yet?  If not, can we have a copy of it?  My understanding is that St. John of God may also have been dealt with and that it was not just the hospice in Harold's Cross.  There were other issues as well.<\/p><p> It is unfortunate that we are back here again.  While we have dealt with this issue, it does not seem that controls have improved to any great degree.

We will come back to it in the work programme.<\/p><p> How many times do we have to be here?  People are very rarely held to account.  The Accounting Officer from the HSE will tell us that the problems are all on the side of the funded organisations.  In fact, the internal auditors of the HSE were in disagreement with the director general in terms of whether there were systemic issues for the HSE.  We have to deal with this once and for all because there is obviously a need to sharpen up governance arrangements.

Nothing will happen and everybody walks away freely without consequence.  This has happened with the Garda matters we looked at among others matters.  The lack of answers forthcoming and the lack of candour that we have seen demonstrates that this committee, which is the only constitutional committee of the State, can be treated with disdain and contempt without fear or favour.  The CEOs of State agencies need have no concerns about how money is spent or how things are done.  They will come to this committee and any issues will be noted on the audit report but there will be no net outcome.  The same thing then happens a couple of years later and we are here again.

While it may seem that there has not been much reaction, I certainly feel that a better effort is being made by the HSE to get on top of the oversight issue.  Earlier I mentioned the tightening of controls as a result of the committee's consideration of the levy fund.  The complete effect of that tightening up has not worked its way through the system for the time period that the internal audit was looking at.  One of the things we have been pushing with the HSE is for it to acknowledge that there are problems and to outline the steps it is taking.  Each year in the statement on internal financial control it has acknowledged that weaknesses have been brought to its attention by my office and by its own internal audit and that it is making better efforts.  It still has things to fix and it will take more time to achieve tighter control in that area, but I do believe that it is happening, that the HSE has engaged with the matter and that it is trying to deal with it at a systemic level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I am not convinced that the HSE has faced up to all of its responsibilities here, but to be fair, if Mr. McCarthy has noticed from his perspective a shift in terms of better governance and better oversight, that is good.

If it were to be published, it would have to be legally prepared and tested in case anybody wanted to contest an issue.  It is essentially an internal matter.  To publish something that was produced only to a standard for internal circulation would be a different issue for the HSE.  The HSE has never published its internal audit report because it would have to proof every internal audit report legally and it would lead to different issues.  In terms of the Console audit report, we all received copies of it here and discussed it at length.  Neither the HSE nor this committee published it.  It was widely circulated in the media but we did not publish it because there was obviously some quite strong issues therein which might have led to legal issues.

From recollection of our exchange with the director general, however, section 39 organisations might receive only 5% of their funding from the HSE, for example.  The valid point was made that we do not want to create too much red tape for small organisations that might not have the expertise to deal with higher levels of oversight.  However, a section 38 organisation is a horse of a different colour and there must be far higher levels of oversight of such organisations.

I am not going to accept this.  We have been down the road on this a number of times.  I raised another issue in respect of the Cork Opera House, which they are now funding under own funded sources or whatever phrase they use.<\/p> <p>  The issue here is that there is an extra pension liability as a result of legal challenges to decisions that were made by the college.  As a consequence, that has to be met by the university and paid for proportionately out of that whole pie of funding by the taxpayer.  That is the bottom line here.  We need to get to the bottom of why we ended up in this scenario on these pensions from this university.  What professional decisions were made on employment that resulted in people getting their legal entitlements - I have no issues with that - ending up in court and winning?<\/p> <p>  Ultimately it is the taxpayer who pays.  I do not buy any of this rubbish about non-taxpayer funded sources.  They should be banned, in my opinion.  It all goes into one pot.  The total taxpayer-related funding could be 60%, 70% or whatever.  Whatever the net cost to the taxpayer of an issue like this because of decisions they made, it is proportionately being paid in that amount by the taxpayer in the first place.  We need to ask questions about this and dig into it.  The taxpayer is ultimately funding the majority of this bill.  It is not non-taxpayer related funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#H02300","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>From an accounting perspective, I can fully understand how one would and could label it as non-Exchequer funding sources.  From a financial or accounting perspective, that is fine.  We know there are multiple income streams, separate from State funding, for institutes of technologies and more so for universities.  The difficulty, as Teachta Kelly said, is that there is an added liability to this being met by the institution.  Even if we take the line that it is coming from non-Exchequer funding sources, that means the money is not being spent on other services.  It is sleight of hand in some respects.  It is still money that is spent by an institution that is primarily funded by the taxpayer.  Contributions from parents and students have also increased substantially in recent years.  Any added liability as a consequence of actions taken would obviously raise concerns for us and for those who pay the fees.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General might be able to help me unpack some of the language.  The document states, \"This treatment is not in accordance with the requirements of FRS 102 Section 21 [whatever that is] 'Provisions and Contingencies' because the receivable is contingent in nature.\"  Will Mr. McCarthy explain to us what that means in layman's terms?  The document also refers to \"the non-consolidation of Cork University Foundation DAC, which had accumulated reserves of &euro;4.1 million\".  Teachta Connolly has raised issues about foundations before.  Is that a qualified opinion because the consolidation did not happen as quickly as it should have?  Is that what the issue is?<\/p> <p>  Reading the final reference in this section of the document, here we go again with procurement.  Going back to the point made by Teachta MacSharry on procurement, there is no sanction or penalty.  We have said this over and over again.  It is becoming really frustrating.  What is the point in having all of these accounts presented to us?  Almost every week, there is some public body that does not follow procurement guidelines.  Notwithstanding whether they are watching their backs in terms of being sued or if there is a party that did not get the contract that might sue them, that is separate in my view.

We are joined from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform by Mr. Robert Watt and Mr. Brendan Ellison; from the National Development Finance Agency by Mr. Gerard Cahillane, Mr. Paul O'Neill and Mr. Sean Court; from the Department of Education and Skills by Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Ms Emma Leonard and Mr. Gary O'Doherty; and from Transport Infrastructure Ireland by Mr. Michael Nolan, Mr. Nigel O'Neill and Mr. Michael Kennedy.<\/p><p>We have picked Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the Department of Education and Skills as two of the key State bodies involved in PPPs.  Other Departments are involved in PPPs, but we could not bring everybody in and considered these to be two of the key bodies involved, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and especially the National Development Finance Agency which is heavily involved in the entire process.<\/p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to airplane mode.

PPPs may take a number of forms, reflecting the manner in which investment project risks are shared between the public and private partners and the manner in which the private sector partners are remunerated for their input.  In many cases, the public sector partner pays the private sector partner for the provision of the assets or services in the form of regular agreed unitary payments over the life of the contract.  In other cases, including tolled roads, the private sector partner is remunerated through payments by service users or a combination of user charges and State payments.<\/p> <p>  The report before the committee aims to provide an overview, to mid-2017, of PPP-related payments and commitments made by central government agencies arising from contracts entered into in the past two decades and further projects in development.  Members should note that the report does not deal with PPP commitments entered into by local authorities, for example, in respect of the Poolbeg waste incineration facility or the areas of water and wastewater treatment facilities, responsibility for which has transferred to Irish Water.<\/p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform maintains a central website providing details of the Exchequer-funded payments under public private partnership, PPP, arrangements.  This indicates that as of end-2016, projects already entered into involve Exchequer payments totalling an estimated &euro;9.6 billion, with just over &euro;3 billion already incurred and an estimated &euro;6.6 billion in outstanding commitments.  This compares to total Exchequer payments and commitments on PPP projects at end 2012 estimated at &euro;6.1 billion.<\/p><p> In figure 4.1, the report outlines the status as at July 2017 of a programme of 12 major PPP projects in train or announced in July 2012.  Three of the projects have not progressed as PPPs.  Of the remainder, two were operational by July 2017, six were in construction and one was still in procurement.  Two further projects announced after 2012 - a social housing bundle and a second motorway services area bundle - had commenced procurement by July 2017, and a number of others were in development at that time.  Payments under Exchequer-backed PPP arrangements in 2016 amounted to &euro;225 million.  We noted that the infrastructure and capital investment plan 2016 to 2021 had indicated that a cash limit had been placed on the annual cost of PPPs.  The Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be able to update the committee in that regard.<\/p><p> The Department&rsquo;s public spending code requires that, before a State body commits to a major capital project, it should assess whether there is a clear socio-economic case for the infrastructure or service.  If such a case can be made, a follow-on exercise is required to establish whether it is more cost effective to procure the proposed investment via a PPP structure or to use a more conventional procurement approach.  This value for money testing of the procurement method is done by comparing the projected Exchequer net cost under the PPP approach with the estimated benchmark net cost of delivering the project using conventional procurement.  Responsibility for ensuring the value for money testing is done rests with the sponsoring Department or agency, and the National Development Finance Agency assists public sector bodies with this analysis as required.<\/p><p> Public bodies are also required to carry out look-back evaluations of PPP projects when they are up and running for a reasonable time, indicating how the outturn compares to the original project proposed, and what useful lessons can be learned for improving succeeding projects, including those procured conventionally.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland does this routinely, and the Courts Service reviewed the Central Criminal Court's PPP.  At the reporting date, however, the Department of Education and Skills had not carried out any look-back reviews, even though it has many PPPs in place.  I have previously reported that very little information is made publicly available about PPP pre or post contract with regard to value for money evaluation results.  Publication of the evaluations, or at least summaries of key evaluation assumptions and findings, should help to improve public understanding of the factors that influence the achievement of good value for the public money spent on PPPs.<\/p><p> Contract monitoring and enforcement are key to ensuring good value is delivered through PPPs.  Penalties provided for in contracts have been applied in some cases where service performance and availability of facilities have not met specified standards.  Periodic benchmarking and market testing of service costs have also been carried out in a number of cases but these have generally not resulted in significant changes in costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General.

We welcome the report and its recommendation.<br\/><br\/>The primary role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in PPPs is to facilitate the PPP process centrally by developing the general policy framework and the capital investment policy framework, within which the PPP operates.  The new national development plan, launched by the Government recently, is the new framework within which we consider these matters.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also facilitates the PPP process by providing central guidance to Departments and other State authorities in that context.  Responsibility for individual PPP and concession projects rests with the relevant sponsoring Department or agency, where appropriate.  This includes financial responsibility and responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the public spending code and the overall PPP guidance set out by our Department.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform publishes a full suite of guidance to facilitate the PPP process, which is available on the central PPP unit's website at <i>www.ppp.gov.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>To ensure that Departments obtain the best value-for-money from public capital investment, PPPs are subject to the same robust and rigorous project appraisal process as applies to traditionally procured projects.  All projects over &euro;20 million are required under the public spending code to be subject to a cost benefit analysis or cost effectiveness analysis.  In addition, the public spending code also requires that the sponsoring agency seeks the advice of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, on all projects above &euro;20 million, in terms of the optimum means of financing the project on a value for money basis, to assess whether traditional or PPP methods of procurement are the best way to ensure value for money and to deliver the project for the taxpayers and citizens.  The public spending code also provides that the options should be considered by the sponsoring agency as part of the project appraisal.<br\/><br\/>The public spending code requirements ensure that all PPPs are subject to specific value for money tests at four stages during the procurement process.  There are particular requirements in respect of PPP projects.<br\/><br\/>Following completion of the project, all PPPs are subject to the public spending code requirement that a post project review be carried out, once sufficient time has elapsed to allow the project to be properly evaluated with sufficient evidence of the flows of benefits and costs from the project.  There should be two separate focuses of such a review - project outturn and the appraisal and management procedures.  These may be undertaken at the same time or at different stages, but they should be done as soon as is practicable.  In the case of PPP projects, once contract close has been reached, the cost of the project to the sponsoring agency is essentially set for the duration of the contract.  It is, therefore, possible for an element of the post project review to be undertaken on a provisional basis at that stage.  A final, definitive post-project review for PPP projects will effectively only be possible at the completion of the contract when the asset is handed back to the sponsoring agency and all costs arising under the PPP contract are definitively known.  This is normally after 20 or 25 years, which is the normal period over which these contracts are set.  An interim review conducted mid-way through the life of the contract could provide a useful indication of the likely final outcome at hand-back.<br\/><br\/>Post-project reviews are not the only mechanism for reviewing past experience in order to draw lessons which can be applied in the future.  The NDFA is the financial adviser on all PPPs and procures all accommodation projects on behalf of the sponsoring Departments.  Experience gained on each project procured helps inform the procurement of each subsequent project.  The NDFA also carries out an in-house lessons learned exercise following all PPP procurements.  This enables them to see what improvements can be made in processes and procedures.  This has resulted in a number of changes in the way PPPs are procured over the years.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform chairs a PPP steering group, which meets regularly to review progress across all PPPs in planning, procurement and operation.  This group provides a forum for the sharing of information and experience in the planning and delivery of PPPs, so that lessons learned on one project or in one area can be applied across the entire PPP programme.<br\/><br\/>The committee will also be aware that there have been two recent reviews of PPP policy in Ireland.  One review was part of the public investment management assessment, PIMA, of Ireland undertaken by the IMF in July of last year at the invitation of the Department of Finance.  We asked the IMF to review of capital planning and appraisal, including PPPs.  The second PPP review was undertaken by an inter-Departmental and agency group, which was established in 2017 to review Ireland's experience of PPPs and to make recommendations on the future role of PPPs in the context of the Government&rsquo;s new ten year national development plan.  The PIMA report categorised the institutional strength of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Is that completed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#L00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>The review is completed and is with the Minister.  Aspects of it were referenced in the national development plan.  I would be happy to give a broad outline of where we are but the Government has not approved it yet.  This will happen shortly, at which time it will be published in its entirety.<\/p> <p>  The PIMA report characterised the institutional strength of the PPP management framework as good, and its effectiveness as medium.  The IMF made a small number of recommendations to further strengthen the process and procedures already in place.  The PIMA report was published last November and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p> The report of the PPP review is with the Minister, who intends to bring the report to Government in the coming weeks for approval to publish.  However, the key findings and recommendations agreed were included in the NDP published in February.  These can be summarised as follows.<\/p><p> The review concluded that PPPs have been very useful in the past in facilitating the delivery of important infrastructure projects.  This was particularly the case when the Exchequer was seriously constrained in its ability to fund infrastructure directly during the fiscal crisis.  It was noted that this enabled projects to proceed which would not otherwise have been deliverable on the basis of the Exchequer funding available at that time alone.  However, under more normal economic and fiscal circumstances, the ability to use PPPs to deliver \"additionality\" in that context is now less relevant.  The NDP sets out the Government's plans to increase public capital investment to among the highest levels in the EU and sustain it at that level over the period to 2027.  In this context, the pursuit of further additional investment projects by PPP, over and above the planned NDP level of investment, is not recommended.  To do so would pose a risk that such projects could give rise to a level of public capital investment overall that is not consistent with macroeconomic or fiscal sustainability.  The PPP review therefore recommends that PPPs should continue to feature as a procurement option available to Government for appropriately structured projects which demonstrate value for money over a traditional procurement option and which meet the robust and rigorous tests for project appraisal that apply to all public investment projects under the public spending code.  However, projects to be pursued in this way by PPP should be progressed as part of the NDP, as opposed to additional projects.  This is consistent with the PIMA recommendations.  Accordingly, decisions on pursuing further PPPs will be taken on a case-by-case basis based on the merits of using PPP in the case of each individual project.<\/p><p> The PPP review recommended two other changes, the first of which was the discontinuation of the budgetary control mechanism limiting exposure to PPPs to 10% of the aggregate Exchequer capital allocation on an annual basis.  In effect, this was the approach we introduced a number of years ago which meant that unitary payments in any year could not be more than 10% of the Exchequer capital cost.  Therefore, if the overall Exchequer programme was &euro;5 billion, the unitary payments on PPPs could not exceed more than &euro;500 million on an annual basis.  The review recommended reinstating the previous budgetary control mechanism of charging the capital value of PPPs to the capital allocation of the sponsoring Department over the construction period.  This will ensure that PPPs and traditionally procured projects are treated equally in the selection of the most appropriate procurement mechanism for each individual project.  This approach was also recommended by the IMF in the PIMA report.  This is a significant recommendation which in effect ensures that Departments face the same incentives when they are choosing between a PPP project or an Exchequer-funded project because the capital cost of the PPP would be notionally charged to their accounts as if it were procured traditionally.  This means, regarding the accounting treatment, that there is no bias one way or the other in respect of the selection of projects.  This is a fundamental change which will impact how we select, approve and develop this programme into the future.  In addition, in order to improve transparency in reporting on PPPs, a number of changes in the reporting arrangements have also been recommended and will be introduced.  These involve publishing cost-benefit analyses, CBAs, and public sector benchmark reports and in effect making available the information that is used to make decisions to make that information available publicly.<\/p><p> I hope I have given the committee an understanding of the role of our Department in respect of PPP, some assurance regarding the guidance and procedures which are in place to ensure PPPs are used to provide a value-for-money option for the State, and an update on some of the key policy developments in this area.

I ask the committee to think about the building of a school.  Let us say the school costs &euro;5 million.  Traditionally, one would take two or three years to build the school and the cost would be charged to the Exchequer in the normal way.  This is the normal appropriation with which members would be familiar.  It is a standard, traditional approach.  It is how most schools, for example, are procured.  PPPs involve a contract whereby we enter into an agreement for 20 or 25 years.  The private sector builds, as it would in the case of traditional appropriation, but under design-build-operate-finance, DBOF, it would also provide the finance and would enter into an agreement to sustain, maintain and hand back the school after 25 years.  There is therefore a difference between this type of contract and the way in which we traditionally procure.  The unitary payments then would be made over 20 or 25 years.  That would be the standard.  These unitary payments would be a charge on the Exchequer each year over the period of the contract.  The unitary payment in effect would cover the capital cost, the financing cost and the operating and maintenance costs of the project.  That is the commonest standard form.<\/p> <p>  Road projects are a combination of concessions whereby tolling is involved as well, so there is a combination of user charges and unitary payments.  This is a little more complex, but in effect we enter into an agreement whereby company X would build a motorway and there would be a concession.  Some of the projects could be tolled, and the toll could meet a significant part of the payment.  Then there could be issues regarding guarantees.  Our colleagues from Transport Infrastructure Ireland can talk in more detail about some of these contracts.  They are quite complex.  Again, they are a subset of PPPs which are different.  Outside of tolling, the main one would be a DBOF, which is as I have described.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Are there any design-build-operate-maintain contracts without finance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#M00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Yes.

It is very difficult to make a comparison between a PPP project, which sets out the financing cost, the maintenance and so on, against a traditionally procured approach where the maintenance cost or something like that is a budgetary over time.

They are more complex and more involved, and there are different stages in the process.  There is the procurement, the financial close area and so on.  It is probably fair to say it is more complex, and that complexity can lead to more risks.  As the Deputy will have seen from the papers, we have in place a very detailed approach to assessing, valuating and procuring to ensure we are minimising that risk and getting value for money for the Exchequer, but there is no doubt these can be incredibly involved and, with complexity, can become more risky.  The key challenge for us is to ensure the risk is transferred to the private sector.  That is part of the reason we pay higher financing costs.  For example, the risk of maintaining the school over 25 years is with the private contractor.  With traditional procurement, we build a school and then the school principal and board of management, with the support of the Department, is responsible for maintaining it so in terms of the risk on us to maintain that school, within a PPP that risk is transferred and they have to hand over the school in good condition after 25 years or there are penalties incurred.  That risk transfer piece is the key issue for us.  In terms of the higher costs we pay and whether we are getting the benefit of those risk transfers, that comes down to a judgment, and it can be difficult at times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#O01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>That judgment can be very difficult when we are talking about risk transfer and traffic guarantee payments.

It was completed in October 2012 and the complex had opened around 2009.  The stated overall aim of the review was to determine whether any stage of the courts project could have been done better, with any lessons applied to future projects.  The review approach concentrated on assessing the processes used rather than the outcome of the project in terms of impact on court business.  At an overall level, the review concluded that the project objectives had been realised within a timeframe appropriate for a PPP project of its complexity.  It concluded that the project processes had been satisfactory.  The review suggested that further analysis should be carried out to assess the operational impacts resulting from the delivery of the project.<\/p> <p>  In terms of learning lessons, the review included recommendations for the PPP process and some of the recommendations were specific to the project; others had more general application.  These indicated that future projects should report against a benefits realisation plan and strategy and an issues log should be produced and maintained to record details of key decisions in a single document.  It is important to distinguish between a process review, or seeing how procurement worked and whether it could be streamlined, and whether the value proposal or business case was realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":420,"content":"<p>It was a partial review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P02800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":421,"content":"<p>It was a process review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":422,"content":"<p>It was a limited review but lessons could still be learned regarding the process for future PPPs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":423,"content":"<p>It was not a cost-benefit review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":424,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>We have not any post-project review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>We are back to zero.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03400","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>The reviews done by Transport Infrastructure Ireland will look at the realisation of benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>As I stated earlier, we have done ten post-project reviews.

One of the big lessons we learned was that forecasting traffic in a toll demand scenario was very difficult.  As Deputy Burke mentioned, there was significant risk and much of it was carried by the private sector.  There are two schemes with a floor on the exposure of the private sector but it means they are hovering at a low level in terms of where they thought they might be with traffic.  For the other six toll concession schemes out there, they carried all the risk.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, the reviews we undertook were for the procurement and statutory approval processes, as well as how it was done and the out-turn and timing of processes.  In a number of cases, it was recommended, given that traffic had not been as expected, that additional cost-benefit analyses should be done.  These were done in two cases and there is another we ought to do.  We will do that.  In all cases, it found that processes were satisfactory and the decision to procure via PPP was correct.  The cost-benefit outturns proved that the roads continued to represent value for money for the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":429,"content":"<p>We have to take the witness's word for that because we have not seen the reports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":430,"content":"<p>We will publish them and the committee will see the final document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Is there a timescale for the publication?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>If we had two or three months we could give the committee perfect documents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P04000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>We must wait and see.

We accept the merit of the argument and we are in favour of having a much more transparent and open approach to these matters in order that Deputies, on behalf of the citizens, can establish that these projects represent value for money.

What Mr. Watt seems to miss is that we have not got the information which we need.  Yes, we can welcome that he has now come to the view that the post-project reviews should be published but we are here today to ask questions.  The meeting is today, not next month, in three months' time or next year, whenever these reports are eventually published.  It is today and we do not have the reviews.  Our job is to examine and to probe.  One of the observations from the Comptroller and Auditor General, in his opening remarks and in his report, is that there is a lack of public scrutiny, public debate and public accountability in the whole area of PPPs.  I would not imagine that the Comptroller and Auditor General was talking about the political sphere alone, but also about academics and other outside organisations, which would also look at this area because reports are not published.  Let us be honest, some of these reports go back 16 years.  It has been 16 years and only one has been published.  That is why we are frustrated and if that upsets any of the officials here, so be it.  We have a job to do and we are to do it today, not tomorrow, next month, in six months or in a year.

I accept what the Comptroller and Auditor General said when he gave the context.  If I am reading this right, and I want to be fair to everybody, there was opposition from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the past to publishing the post-project reviews.  We then had an analysis, review or examination by the International Monetary Fund.  It carried out a review and people would have been consulted.  On the back of that there was a change of heart.  A different position was adopted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is now open to publishing these post-project reviews.  That does not excuse the matter or answer the question as to why they were not carried out at all in one of the key Departments, namely, the Department of Education and Skills.  I do not believe that Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has given a satisfactory answer as to why not a single post-project review has been carried out.  This goes right to the heart of public accountability.  How can we evaluate whether there was good use of taxpayers' money, whether benchmarks which were set were met, whether there were any legal issues or impediments, or whether we got value for money?  None of this can be evaluated by this committee because Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and his Department have not carried out any post-project reviews.  Will he take me through that again in layman's terms?

The concept of a post-project review is a mid-term concept.  Our first completion was in 2002 and we are now 16 years on from that out of 25.  We focused on that.  We have undertaken a number of value for money tests.  We were the first Department to publish post-project public service benchmark, PSB, information.  We have also now made available to the committee the three PSBs for the first three schools bundles that had PSBs.  We are now publishing PSBs, as a policy, five years after so that commercial sensitivity is protected.  We have been very open with regard to being innovative in publishing information about PSBs and in publishing PSBs.  Analysis of those PSBs can be undertaken.  We saw the post-project review process as a mid-term review process.  We sought to do it a small number of years ago but we realised that we needed an intensity of engagement with it such that, given the pressures that we had to deliver school places, we had to prioritise school places.  School place delivery was prioritised over the last five or six years in a major way as we faced this demographic bulge.

I will try to calm things down a bit.  It is probably the first time I have attempted to do that at this forum.  Transparency is part of the issue with which we are dealing.  To be fair to the witnesses, some of the things we are analysing here predate their appointment to their current positions.  The economic circumstances in this country have gone all over the place since many of these PPPs were signed.  A great deal of decision-making needs to be contextualised.  It should also be remembered that political pressure on decision-making does not help sometimes.  There is some frustration about the process of getting information out there.  I accept that commitments have been given by the Secretary General in the context of writing to Departments.  I am sure everyone will get the information out there.  That will be co-ordinated.  We will take that at face value.<\/p> <p>  I have some valuable and useful information about the change in the PPP review and the mechanism for limiting exposure to PPPs to 10% of aggregate Exchequer value.  I think there is a need for a peer-to-peer review of PPP projects that compares such projects with directly-funded projects.  I agree that Exchequer-funded projects do not represent value for money.  This is not always evident, however, when such projects are subjected to line-by-line comparisons with PPP projects.  When value is being assessed, consideration must be given to whether something was a priority for spending in the first instance.  At a future date, I will, along with TII officials, review the analyses and algorithms used when decisions were made on some of the projects that were selected for inclusion in the 2040 plan, with a particular focus on those which may or may not have changed in the weeks before the launch.<\/p> <p>  We certainly need to conduct a peer-to-peer examination that compares Exchequer-funded projects and PPP projects.  There needs to be a breakdown by sector within that equation.  There is no one present from the Department of Health, but I would like to mention as an example the bundles that were drawn up for PPP primary care centres.  When I see the centres that are progressing, including the one in Carrick-on-Suir in my constituency, I look at the other options which have been set out in competitions for the construction of primary care centres.  Some of those who win contracts essentially flip them by selling them on.  It is speculation, basically.  Again, there is exposure here.  When we are doing comparisons, we should think about getting down to the unit basis.  It would be helpful if we were to look not just at roads, but also at the decisions made within that realm.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus on a couple of direct issues.  I had the pleasure of travelling through the Limerick tunnel going to and from a certain match last weekend.  I would like to go through the costs relating to this famous road, as set out on pages 67 and 68 of the report.<\/p><p>I am particularly interested in the total exposure as regards the traffic risk sharing component on pages 67 and 68 of the report.  I want to get into the real figures, if possible.  These questions are for TII.  No. 2 is a design, build, operate, fund and maintain, DBOFM, classification and the total project cost is &euro;281 million.  Note F reads: \"Includes payments required under the traffic guarantee contract mechanism.  The nominal value of remaining payments does not include any amounts for future payments under this mechanism\".  It costs &euro;4.6 million because of the traffic flows and there are low and medium traffic growth projections.  What has it cost as part of the traffic risk sharing component to date and what is the projected cost based on current levels?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#T03500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>In the briefing document provided we have not provided projections for traffic guarantee or variable operation payments as they are described.

We had to engage with the European Commission to try to progress the scheme, to see how we might do it in terms of the procurement process.  We did not want to have to start the entire process again.  That was 2010.  It was 2014 when we awarded the contract.  There was significant downtime because of the funding crisis.  Had that not happened the scheme would have been built long before that.  Once we had got over that hurdle, and I am looking to my right at colleagues in the National Development Finance Agency who were our financial advisors on the matter, we eventually did get funders to come back into the market.  A very limited pool of banks was willing to fund then.  Earlier, additional schemes were mentioned.  These were developed at a difficult time for the economy and gave many jobs in the west at a difficult time for the economy.  It was very difficult.

We looked at contract management arrangements at that stage and I think the Deputy has already referred to an issue that I raised.  What we found at the time was that the CIT staff member acting as the contract manager for the two CIT projects had been involved with the project since the procurement stage and had been involved in managing the contracts since the two projects became operational.  The examination found that the contract manager had detailed knowledge of the project arrangements.  A matter that I raised in conclusion was that while CIT also had significant skills and experience in respect of the management of PPP contracts, there was a risk of over-reliance on a single individual as much of CIT's capacity in this area was vested in the contract manager for the two CIT projects.  The risk that was there would appear to have crystallised when the individual retired.  The college was left without a capacity and a knowledge base.  Based on what I have already reported, I do not think it is fair to characterise the individual as not having relevant skills or experience.

At this stage, we seek to identify all of the risks throughout the lifetime of the project, from planning stage to construction stage and in regard to facilities management and life-cycling to ensure that facilities will be handed back in a fit state after 25 years.  At the end of a PPP project, there is a residual life requirement.  For example, the roof would have to be good for 35 years, the plant and equipment would have to be good for ten years and the paint work would have to be good for five years.  Possible risks at each stage are identified and the cost of fixing any problems that arise are quantified.  We assign a probability to each of those risks and we develop a risk matrix.  We then identify who is the best party to manage the risk.  We only allocate risk to the private sector that it is best able to manage and we keep risks on the State side that we are best able to manage.  For example, in the case of a school in which there are pupils, we would not pass on that risk to the private school but we do pass construction risk to the private sector.  Once all of the risks have been quantified in a risk matrix, they are then translated into the contract and we ask the private sector to price in that regard as part of its bid for the facility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#GG02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Cahillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":800,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Cahillane satisfied that the formula for the calculating risk is the correct one?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#GG02100","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":801,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#GG02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Cahillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":802,"content":"<p>Does the Comptroller and Auditor General agree?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#GG02300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":803,"content":"<p>It is a process of estimation.

We have not made any unitary payments yet and we will not do so until the school is handed over.  This is an example of where risk transfer is working.  In the case of a PPP, they have very clear incentives to complete works and hand over the schools because they will not get any payments until they do so.<\/p> <p>  In the case of traditional procurement, the implications of a company going bust could be even more severe because we have made substantial capital payments during the course of the construction stage.<\/p><p>That could be more difficult for the State as we would have to get a new contractor to finish when we had invested a significant amount of Exchequer funds in the project.

It is an interesting example of how the risk transfer provisions with a PPP work and should be seen to work.  To answer the Deputy's question it is implicitly the case that within the comparator the risk is taken into account.  Whether we do it traditionally or by PPP, there is always a risk the developer could go bust.  I think of O'Devaney Gardens a number of years ago where the project did not happen.  One must then get a new contractor and there could be a delay where people who were relying on that housing may have to be housed elsewhere.  That is a cost or risk associated with any project, whether it is a PPP or official.  The point the Deputy makes is valid and those potential costs are inherent in all projects we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#GG02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":807,"content":"<p>Do we have a figure on any of those indirect costs which we may have accrued?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#HH00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":808,"content":"<p>It has not happened that often that we have had a situation in which a company has been liquidated.

There is that cost.  In the case of housing, people may have to be housed.  We can certainly come back to the Deputy if we can find historical examples where that has happened.  It is a challenge we face across the board.

That creates numerous problems for the State which we have to manage our way through as best we can.

We have moved back to the original budgetary control mechanism where in effect the capital cost of the PPP will be charged against the account of the body as if it were an Exchequer project.  That means that when the sponsoring entity or Department is looking at the project from an accounting perspective, there is no advantage one way or the other as to how that is accounted for when a decision is made on which option to go for.  If a secondary school costs &euro;20 million, for example, and it takes three years to build, that will be set notionally against the account of the Department of Education and Skills for its budget.  That means the PPP and the Exchequer or traditional approach would be accounted for in the same way when deciding on the merits of projects.

I have given one example of learning.  I will give a second.  There are more, but the second has been to change how we do the planning in terms of the processing.  We used to get outline planning permission and now we get full planning permission because that way there can be more certainty and it does not create a doubt, an uncertainty and a risk, especially given planning within the State.<\/p><p>That is very important.<\/p><p> I wanted to give a couple of examples to show that we have not introduced this, sat on our hands and not learned any lessons.  We have learned significant lessons.  I would prefer if we had completed a review and I am disappointed that we have not.  I referred to it as a mid-term review.  I would rather that we had done it a significant time ago but we have not been able to do so.  It is a very complex review.  We are going to take a bundle of approximately five schools to be compared to five other schools and analyse the effectiveness of how the facilities have been run, look at the standard of the buildings and compare and contrast all of those aspects.  It is going to be a huge piece of work.  We have tracked the numbers in the schools but the review will also consider that.  It is going to look at all of those elements and I expect that we will learn from it.  I do not think we will repeat it in the same way because it is so intense.  We started doing it four or five years ago and had to pause and rethink how we were doing it.  We have now restarted it.

The difficulty is that there is a dearth of genuine, transparent reporting and analysis in the State in regard to whether we get value for money.  One of the issues referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General is that far more could be done to improve public debate in this State on PPPs.

I am of the view that there has been insufficient scrutiny, oversight and genuine public debate because the data are not there.  None of the post-project reviews have been published.  How can any academic or think-tank evaluate them if the data or reviews are not available?  There is much we can learn and many improvements we can make in terms of what is going to happen.<\/p><p>It is just disappointing that it did not happen up to now.  Mr. Watt can respond to that if he wishes.  If I can just make a final point, the other thing I learned is that the code Mr. Watt referenced earlier is voluntary.  I want to come back to that.  It is not a legal requirement and it is not underpinned by legislation.  It is still a voluntary code.  That is something from a policy perspective, which is not a matter for Mr. Watt but for Government, to which we should return to in our own periodic report because it has been raised with us and we have had some discussion on it.  I do not know whether Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; or Mr. Watt would like to respond to my general observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#KK05500","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":912,"content":"<p>As an observation, in order to have a debate we need to put out information.  We have provided an awful lot of information as part of these discussions.  The first step is to look at the public sector benchmark and the comparator between the assessment of cost benefits for traditionally procured projects and those of projects procured through PPP.  For the first time that information is out there and that could lead to informed debate around assessing which option we should go for.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned in respect of a previous issue around risk, there is an element of estimation here.  It is not clear-cut.  There needs to be debate about that.  People need to scrutinise the comparator and see if they are content with its robustness.  Based on the information which we set out, there is potential to have a much more informed debate.  Just having the information out there does not, of course, mean that debate will be informed, but it has the potential to be.  The post-project reviews could also help, but let us see how that contributes to the debate.<\/p> <p>  This issue is not exclusive to PPPs.  It is relevant for all public works.  The whole debate is very important because there is a lot of discussion about how we fund infrastructure.  People talk about off-balance sheet and innovative solutions and all the rest of it.  Many Deputies responding to many policy issues suggest that there is an innovative or off-balance sheet solution when in fact there is not and the options are that the people who use the infrastructure pay for it, that the taxpayer pays for it now, or that the taxpayer pays for it on a deferred basis.  It must be clarified that somebody has to pay for infrastructure and that how we pay for it is the key issue.  I fully agree with the Deputy in terms of the debate.  <\/p> <p>  On the public code, I do not think we would describe it as voluntary.  It is not voluntary for Departments to decide whether they will do a cost-benefit analysis of a project.  They have to do it or the Minister for Finance or for Public Expenditure and Reform will not approve the money because the Government will not approve it.  It is not voluntary in that sense but there is no legal sanction because it is not based on legislation.  Of course, there are many things which we do not put in legislation for very good reasons.  Administrative rules and regulations drive much of our activity.  Whether we want to go down the route of trying to codify it in law is another policy issue but it would raise many different questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#LL00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":913,"content":"<p>I have one final observation.

There has, however, been a little bit of a myth that has been going around here today that these became popular during the recession when the State encouraged this type of finance.  I do not believe this is the case.  These projects were in their height in the good times before the recession.  When the recession came along many of the projects that had been in the pipeline stopped.  This is the exact opposite to what some people have said at the committee today.  The Clonee project for example started in 2010.  That contract would have been made three years earlier.  The Limerick project and the M50 were also in 2010.  This means that all those contracts were signed in 2007.  The Kilcock-Kinnegad contract was signed around 2002, the Dundalk contract would have been signed in 2002, the Fermoy project signed in 2003, the Waterford project was signed in 2006, the Galway-Ballinasloe M6 project was signed around 2006, the M7 and M8 in Portlaoise was signed around 2006-2007, and the motorway services project was signed around 2007.  It has been said a few times in this committee that most of these projects were going when the State was not able to access finance and that they were good for employment and so on.  This is not the case at all.  The projects actually ground to a halt then.  I recall some of the decentralisation programmes under PPP, one of which was three big Government offies in Carlow, Mullingar and Portlaoise.  These went to final stage in the process.  The contractor had spent millions of euro as the preferred bidder but the project was pulled at the end.  This is an example of the risks borne by bidders in competitions.  I have asked if that person was paid.  That instance was offices for the Government so it was probably an OPW project.  My point is that these projects collapsed during the recession and they are now picking up again.  They were not countercyclical.  They were very much it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#NN03100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#NN03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>Am I correct in saying this?

They were not.  The assessments were done as a comparison.  I refer the committee to pages 12 to 14, inclusive, of the briefing document.  The information looks at post-project reviews.  Page 12 contains the list I have read out.  Page 13 looks at the conclusion of post-project reviews.  These are the reviews that have been done which will be published shortly.  When the committee sees these reviews, we will talk again.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has included some conclusions in the document forwarded to the committee today.  The conclusions cover planning, the implementation of projects, the objectives achieved in helping to reduce traffic volumes and congestion in towns and bypass routes, reduction in the numbers of fatalities, and the contribution to providing the motorway and dual carriageway network routes.  When Transport Infrastructure Ireland conducts its post-project reviews, how does it take account of the value of these motorways in the reduction of fatalities?  Motorways have done this.  Before these towns were bypassed by motorways, we know that people had been killed by vehicles in the towns.  It is a fact that the motorways have saved lives.  I cannot think of a town that did not have fatalities before the bypasses were constructed.  The bypasses also took the juggernauts out of the towns and allowed them to do a bit of local business instead of three miles of juggernauts each way every evening.  How does Transport Infrastructure Ireland incorporate this value or does it just do the review on specifics?  Does it look at societal benefits over and above cost values?  There are other benefits to motorways and does Transport Infrastructure Ireland take this into account?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#NN04300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":1057,"content":"<p>In the cost-benefit analysis of a scheme one would look at the existing history of that section of road.

Essentially, a lay person reading about the Limerick tunnel and Clonee route would conclude that, without the State agreeing to that minimum payment for minimum traffic, that project might not have happened.

We are nearly there.  I wish to raise some issues.  During the lunch break Deputy MacSharry raised the issue in previous meetings of the PAC information had been sought in respect of the Cork Institute of Technology.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has checked his records in the meantime and has confirmed that he did write back to the previous Committee of Public Accounts committee on 10 June 2014.  I wish to put that formally on the record as there was confusion about it earlier.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons we are here is because public private partnerships have a role.  I am agnostic on the policy approach but not everyone is agnostic on the issue.  If they are good, they are good.  If they do a job, I have no issue, but the public is always entitled to know whether we are getting value for money.  In the course of the past year we have had Transport Infrastructure Ireland before the committee and the Department of Education and Skills.  When we see a significant payment going out each year through the appropriation account for PPPs and we are told it is for a school or a bypass, the PAC does not know if it provides good value for money and that gives some people an opportunity to say it is not good value for money.  It would be in the interests of the PPP disciples to put more information out there to show whether the projects are good value for money to prove their point but as long as there are no explanations a vacuum causes problems.<\/p> <p>  In recent months the committee has not approved any appropriation account with PPP payments because we cannot say whether we think it is good or bad.  There is a gap in the process from the point of view of the PAC.  I cannot stand over appropriation accounts on the Plinth if there is a figure for &euro;120 million for a PPP if I and the PAC are not satisfied that it was good value for money.  The witnesses can understand where we are coming from.  There has been a lot of secrecy in the past but society moves on.  Contracts are in place and there is printed information available.  As time goes on people will know that once a contract is up and running the commercial sensitivity diminishes and it is not necessary to wait for many years to pass.  Essentially, that is one of the reasons we are here.<\/p> <p>  I know the committee will not be satisfied to conclude this chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report until probably much later in the year when we see some of these reports.  I do not say there is an issue but it will make it all the better if we can issue a report having seen more information but we are not at that point yet.  The witnesses seem to be saying we will get to that point soon.  In due course we will come back to that topic.  That is all I wish to say.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  I accept the exchanges in the meeting earlier on were robust but there is a bit of frustration among members due to the information that is not yet available that we would like to see.  We hope it will become available shortly.<\/p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses from the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Education and Skills, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff, and the National Development Finance Agency.  We will not dispose of chapter 4 for the reasons stated.  We will now adjourn until our next public meeting on Thursday, 29 March at 9 a.m. when we will be considering the grant funding to Galway's art house cinema, which is chapter 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.

I thank the committee for inviting us this morning to talk about the proposed sale of non-performing loans.  We believe this is an important matter in particular in respect of the ongoing relationship with institutional investors and the minimum standards required for a fully functioning secure lending market.  We believe this really gets to the heart of the issue of whether Ireland sees its banks as institutions managed for sustainable value creation and for providing the lifeblood of commerce and economic activity.<\/p> <p>  We should be clear at the outset that the fiduciary responsibility of this team is to the owners of the business.  We are here to maximise the return for all Irish taxpayers.  I intend to share my time with Shane O'Sullivan, who will briefly outline the progress we have achieved in the area of mortgage arrears management.<\/p> <p>  I will outline some key points.  At the beginning of 2012, the troika and the Government mandated that long-term forbearance was the primary tool in managing mortgage arrears.  This was sensible for two reasons.  First, it avoided widespread repossessions.  Second, the capital cost to the banks of capital forbearance was considered the least-worst alternative for all Irish taxpayers.  There was recognition of course that even long-term forbearance is subsidised by all taxpayers, as long-term treatments do not necessarily pay the full level of interest or capital on the loan.  It is important to remind everyone here that Irish banks were capitalised by the taxpayer on the basis of that approach.  They were not capitalised to support debt forgiveness.<\/p> <p>  I will let Mr. O'Sullivan tell the story of arrears management.  However, as of today the Single Supervisory Mechanism is clear that all European banks should now manage down their non-performing loan stocks in a credible and ambitious manner.  In parallel, it is important to note that the European Banking Authority has narrowed the definition of a non-performing loan.  In simple terms, the only way an asset can be deemed as performing is if it is cured by returning to the terms of the original contract or if it is removed from the balance sheet of the bank.  The rationale is that NPLs reduce the drag on balance sheets.  Managing NPLs reduces the risk of negative consequences at the time of the next economic downturn.  Managing NPLs increases the ability of banks to contribute to the growth of the real economy.  The policy makes banks, including Permanent TSB, safer and more stable.<\/p> <p>  At the end of 2017 our NPL ratio was 26%.  Given that the State owns 75%, it is very much in the State's interest that the bank manages down its NPLs.  It is important to give the regulatory context quickly.  The regulator does not dictate specifically how individual banks should reduce NPLs.  We have never claimed that it did.  The regulator sets out the following: the target; the definitions; the tools that might be used; and, most important, the timescale.  As we sit before the committee today, the regulatory guidance makes a loan sale an inevitable choice by the bank even if it does not arise from a specific direction by the regulator.  It is simply not possible to meet the regulators target and timescale within the capital envelope without a loan sale.  Of course, a loan sale will not achieve everything on its own.  We have used new ideas and pioneered some important innovations.  The only approach we will not allow is blanket debt forgiveness.<\/p> <p>  In addition we should be under no illusion that the use of extra provisions, for example, to de-recognise a loan from non-performing loan status is not always in the best interests of all Irish taxpayers and other shareholders.  Provisions are essentially trapped capital that would be better used in supporting the growth of the business and the economy.  The role of management is to use those provisions in line with the bank's asset quality.  The bank will only use or increase its provision stack if that is the best use of capital when compared against alternative approaches.  Our governing objective is to repay the money invested by Irish taxpayers and other shareholders.<\/p> <p>  Of course, we must not forget that mortgages are secured loans.  The assets have a lower risk profile and a lower price.  The basis of a secured loan is that if it is not repaid, then the lender has recourse to the asset or can reduce underlying risk in another manner, such as through loan sales.  If that does not happen, then the risks to new business pricing, financial stability and access to the capital markets are exacerbated.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, we have used many different approaches.  We have pioneered debt write-off for buy-to-let investors with non-performing loans.  Circa 1,300 properties were surrendered to the bank.  We facilitated substantial debt write-off in cases of voluntary surrender, including for home loans.  We are strong supporters of mortgage-to-rent.  We believe that up to 1,000 mortgage accounts might be able to avail of this scheme and we are working with two parties, including David Hall's iCare Housing group in respect of such accounts.<\/p> <p>  The result is that last year we reduced our NPL stock by some &euro;600 million, or over 10%.  Since 2013, we have reduced the value of NPLs by approximately &euro;4 billion or 42% of the total value of NPLs that were on the balance sheet four years ago.  However, the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans, as defined by the European Banking Authority, has remained stubbornly high.<\/p> <p>  Several important factors are relevant that I am keen to put before the committee.  First, a reduction in the size of our overall loan book in the same period has made a large impact.  This was accelerated by the sale of approximately &euro;6 billion of performing loans, a move required under the restructuring plan.  Second, the characteristics of the untreated portion of the book &ndash; a matter Mr. Shane O'Sullivan will comment on in a moment - are relevant.  Third, the binding constraint of European NPL definition and its impact on treated loans is relevant.<\/p> <p>  We believe that in order to make progress in reducing this ratio one of the initiatives is to pursue a loan sale.  It is important to say that we are not the first bank to do such a sale and we certainly will not be the last.  While our plans have provoked commentary, the fact is that the sale of NPLs to third parties in what is known as the secondary market is a characteristic of a functioning mortgage market and can facilitate greater flexibility in dealing with customers in arrears.  Since our announcement much of the commentary has focused on customer protection when the loans are sold.  As the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland has confirmed in recent weeks, when a loan is sold the protections travel with the loan and borrowers are protected in accordance with the consumer protection framework.  Of course thousands of such loans have already been sold by a variety of banks in Ireland.  As the Governor pointed out, the evidence to date does not support the narrative that these buyers are managing these loans any more aggressively than the originally banks were.<\/p> <p>  In summary, if Permanent TSB is to prosper and grow to support the ongoing economic development of the country, then the NPL ratio of PTSB must now be reduced dramatically and quickly.  If that is not agreed, then all Irish taxpayers should recognise the consequences therein.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to Shane O'Sullivan to give the committee some facts on how we have managed arrears since 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018032200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1521711000,"counter":1134,"content":"<p>Deputy John McGuinness took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521711000,"counter":1135,"content":"<p>With the help of some slides I wish to address the progress and work that we have already undertaken to manage mortgage arrears and NPLs.  I am mindful of the direction of Deputy McGrath and so I will abbreviate the script as we go along.<\/p> <p>  I wish to draw the eyes of committee members to the first slide.  As Mr. Masding said, in conjunction with the troika-mandated 2012 objective of arrears management the bank has reduced in absolute terms the value of NPLs by 42%, down from &euro;9.1 billion in 2013 to &euro;5.3 billion at the end of 2017.<\/p><p>That is nearly &euro;4 billion less in non-performing loans, NPLs, over a four-year period.  We need to remember other banks had NAMA as an exit for their most difficult NPLs whereas Permanent TSB did not<\/p><p> Despite that good progress, the slide also shows that the ratio of NPLs on our balance sheet has remained stubbornly high at 26% at the end of 2017, which is just one percentage point lower than was the case in 2013.  A contributory factor is that our overall loan book has fallen from &euro;33.5 billion to &euro;20.6 billion in the period.<\/p><p> Of course, a large part of that reduction was as a result of the sale of loans in Ireland, and particularly in the UK, which was required by the EU as part of the group&rsquo;s approved restructuring plan.  That followed the state aid that Permanent TSB received in its rescue by the State.  Finally, we have the European Banking Authority, EBA, Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, and capital context given by Mr. Masding in his opening remarks.<\/p><p> The next slide focuses on arrears management and covers the progress we have made on this crucial issue in recent years.  Permanent TSB has reduced early arrears - loans in arrears for less than 90 days - from 4.8% of its loan book in 2013 to 2.9% last year.  That is lower than the latest available industry average, which is at 3.1%.  For late arrears - loans in arrears over 90 days - we have reduced the percentage of such loans from 15.1% in 2013 to 7.6% at the end of 2017.  Again this is lower than the latest available industry average of 8.2%.  That is a 54% reduction in the percentage of late arrears in home loans and a 56% reduction in respect of buy-to-let loans.  This represents significant progress, all told.<\/p><p> I propose to skip the next slide.  I ask members to move to page 11 of the script, which summarises the slide above.  We are pointing out that the figures are on a property basis and relate to home loans.  In the case of 13,800 of those properties, the loans are now cured and are performing or have been repaid in full.  That is as a result of the very significant efforts and focus on behalf of our customers in very difficult circumstances and on behalf of the bank.  A further 10,200 loans are treated and 10,400 properties are untreated and non-performing.<\/p><p> I will go into further detail on the untreated numbers.  The figure of 10,400 is made up of 4,900 properties where the account holders did not meet the terms of the treatment offered by the bank, 1,700 where the account holders refused the treatment offered by the bank, 1,100 where there was no sustainable treatment that we could identify despite trying to find one and 2,700 properties where the account holders have simply not engaged with the bank.<\/p><p> This slide also gives a pen picture of the average untreated home loan NPL, which is &euro;30,000 in arrears and three years in arrears.  In 23% of these cases, the customer has paid nothing in respect of the mortgage in the calendar year 2017.<\/p><p> That brings Permanent TSB to this inflection point.  Our arrears management strategy has paid dividends over the past five years.  Thankfully for account holders and for the bank, thousands of accounts have been cured.  Thousands more have been treated but will remain in NPL status until cured or removed from the bank&rsquo;s balance sheet.  The overarching role of management in these cases, as with all other segments, is to review all options in order to achieve the best outcome for all Irish taxpayers while ensuring that customer protections are maintained throughout.<\/p><p> Of course thousands of loans remain in a more conventional non-performing status and we have to deal with them, again in a manner which ensures that their existing protections are maintained.<\/p><p> This brings us to this proposed loan sale, which is a necessary step given the bank&rsquo;s capital position - we were not capitalised in 2011 for scale write-off - and given the regulatory context and the urgent priority which has been set for all regulated banks in the eurozone to reduce their NPLs significantly within a tight timescale.

These are not time bound to age 65 and we have splits where borrowers over the age of 65 can repay them.  Also, these are not all reliant on collateral.  The idea is that over the period, between now and the end of the term, we will meet customers on a three-year basis and if times have been good to those customers, it is possible to pay down the warehouse and one is not reliant on the collateral.  The problem at the core is that our borrowers have not been charged interest and that is what means these remain non-performing loans.<\/p> <p>  There is another type of treatment - part capital and interest - which is somewhere between the more conventional term extensions and capitalisation and the splits.

I am guided by my job, as the Deputy will understand.  As the CEO of the bank, my job is to implement the right option for all Irish taxpayers - the shareholders - in order to satisfy our regulatory requirements.  I will explain how I think about this.  When I came to Ireland, the bank had been bailed out by the State to the tune of &euro;4 billion.  What drives us and me every morning is to try to pay that back because that money belongs to the Irish citizens, not to the bank.  As of last night, our share price was &euro;1.86 and our market capitalisation was under &euro;850 million.  Broadly speaking, my maths say that we still owe the State just shy of &euro;1.5 billion.  That belongs to all Irish taxpayers.  That gap is being registered by the market as a function of us not being able to manage down the NPL ratio.  While the Deputy and I might disagree, I am merely giving him my perspective.  I am paid, as a guest in Ireland and the CEO of Permanent TSB, to try to repay the &euro;4 billion.  At the moment, there is a gap and the share price is diminished.  The only way that we can get that money back is to manage down the NPL ratio.  That is the view of the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018032200002#G02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding"},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1258,"content":"<p>It is not the view of the Parliament.  We are not a market.  We have a duty to citizens.  A bank has a duty to customers, including people who have engaged with Permanent TSB for months and years.  I have with me a letter from a customer who tells me that his file is yea deep after years of engagement with the bank.  The letter asks simple questions about whether his is one of the loans that the bank is planning to sell to the vultures.  The letter went to Mr. Masding's office, but the response sent this month was that the bank could not tell the customer.  It did this even though, seeing as how it provided us with the figures of exactly how many loans were in each bundle, it knows which loans are being considered for sale, but it has refused to tell this individual whether his is one of them.  There is a duty of care, not just in terms of the taxpayers' money.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance did not put his hand into his own pocket at the time.  He put his hands into the pockets of the Irish people, customers of the witnesses' bank.  As such, not only is there a duty to repay that to the Irish State, there is a duty of care to the customers.  The Parliament is stating clearly that it does not want Permanent TSB, as a State-owned institution, to sell these loans to the vultures.  The bank needs to work through these loans in a more aggressive way.  The witnesses need to look at how other banks have got around the rules.  They need to wait for the response of the working group of the European Commission or the European Central Bank and deal with these loans on a case-by-case basis.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018032200002#G02600","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1260,"content":"<p>Of the 18,300 mortgages in Project Glas, how many account holders have not engaged with the bank for longer than seven years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018032200002#H00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521711000,"counter":1261,"content":"<p>The slide that was passed around this morning divides the potential loan sale into a number of cohorts.

I can attest that, in practice, that does not happen.  The vulture funds and their agents are unregulated and do not appear before this committee.  The attitude of the agents, who act on behalf of a vulture fund, is despicable.  In fact, they should not be in business at all by virtue of the way that they have treated people.  As I have said before, any civilised society would not tolerate what is going on in the context of vulture funds.  Lest any member of the public is misled by this statement, I can confirm that the opposite is true.  Most people who have gone through the unsavoury experience of dealing with a vulture fund have been left deeply unhappy and traumatised.  I wanted to make it clear to the people who are about to be thrown to the vulture funds that the experience is deeply unpleasant. <\/p><p>I shall refer to the figures mentioned and the general approach adopted to tackle the tracker issue.

I have done a rough calculation.  If the bank sells them at a 40% discount, or at 60% of value, it would probably make &euro;370 million; &euro;740 million at a 30% discount, or 70% of value; or &euro;1.1 billion at a 20% discount or 80% of value.  If the bank has made a provision of 50% and the loans of ordinary homeowners are sold on, they have no say or involvement in any way in whom these loans are sold to.  Suddenly their loans land on the desk of a fund.  If the fund has bought them at a 40% discount and then sells them at more than 60% of the value, it makes a profit.  Ordinary people are asking why they cannot offer 65% of the value of loans.  The bank will be able to write back the provision and book a profit.  Why will the bank not do this?  That is the question we are being asked.  I am bringing this back to what the lay person is asking.  We accept that the bank wants to achieve &euro;2 billion in capital reserves to allow it to function and that it has to deal with NPLs but the issue is how it deals with them.  Will Mr. Masding address that matter?  Given that provision has been made against these loans, why can ordinary homeowners who have taken out the loans pay, for example, 70% of their value?

I am seeking information on the loans in Project Glas.  In how many of them did the bank vote against a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, and in how many did it vote for one?  If there is any perhaps the witnesses can provide a breakdown.  With regard to the question asked by the Chairman about the ratio of splits, can the witnesses also inform the committee about the different grades, for example, the number of accounts above 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% in increments of 10%?  That would be helpful.  Can they also inform us of how much debt was written off where an individual was allowed to stay in the home and the number of instances where that occurred?<\/p> <p>  With regard to their arguments on moral hazard, this works for AIB.  AIB is doing this but Permanent TSB is not.  There is a big difference between AIB and Permanent TSB.  Permanent TSB is in serious trouble.  It needs to get off the high principles and start dealing with reality.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses referred to the buy-to-let write-offs.  There are write-offs for investors.  They said that 66% of the 1,300 houses have tenants.  Are the other 400 houses lying empty, without tenants, in the middle of a housing crisis?<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Masding on the provisions, and I will talk hypothetically.  If there were provisions of 48% against this portfolio and the bank sold for 40%, does that mean there is a profit in the bank because the provisions are obviously more than what the reduction was?  Can he explain that?<\/p> <p>  My last question relates to the splits because there is now more confusion following Senator Kieran O'Donnell's questions.  How many splits are in Project Glas?  What is the full amount between performing, non-performing and the buy-to-lets?  I am so frustrated with this.  I am listening to extremely well paid bankers, no doubt with good intentions, saying they cannot get answers for the regulator for over a year.  AIB is doing this.  It has given its answer to us.  It has 3,190 split loans.  Subject to the new repayment terms being fully met during a probationary period, typically one year, AIB split loans are eligible to return to performing status under EBA non-performing definitions.  This is one bank and the witnesses have no idea how AIB is able to do this.  That is just crazy; it is madness.  Despite the suites of legal and accountancy advisers the witnesses have, they cannot understand how AIB is doing this.  I find that mind boggling.  It is unacceptable that the SSM has not responded to the bank but it is also unacceptable for the bank to say that it has engaged with the SSM since the start of last year and has received no answers so it is going to sell these loans.  I am sure this committee would be better able than Permanent TSB to find out how AIB is able to do this.  Reporters have been writing about how AIB is doing it.  I do not understand how Mr. Masding is overseeing a bank that simply does not know how its competitors are able to achieve what he is not able to achieve.  There are serious questions about that.  It appears that there are approximately 6,000 loans, split mortgages, about to be sold which could be deemed as performing if the bank understood what its competitor bank was doing.  How can he justify that?<\/p> <p>  I would like to have an answer to that question and answers to the other questions, if the witnesses have them.  If not, they could provide the information to the committee.  It is deeply frustrating.  It also must be frustrating for the customers who, unfortunately, went to Permanent TSB instead of AIB and got a split mortgage and, as a result of Permanent TSB being unable to figure out how it meets the criteria, they are being thrown to the wolves.  It is not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018032200002#P00600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1585,"content":"<p>The witnesses can answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018032200002#P00700","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521711000,"counter":1586,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty asked me to write back with the answers so we will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018032200002#P00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding"},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1587,"content":"<p>I am asking for an answer on the last question now.

We will answer as many of their questions as possible.  However, as we have outlined in our responses to the committee's questionnaire, we have not disclosed any information to the market with regard to potential portfolio sales and are constrained in doing so here today.  Alongside me are colleagues from AIB&rsquo;s executive team: Mark Bourke, Tom Kinsella and Hilary Gormley.<br\/><br\/>I will begin by emphasising that AIB has been and remains acutely aware of the very difficult circumstances frequently associated with distressed debt and the need for a sensitive approach towards customers when coping with financial difficulty.  Responding to the clear debt crisis facing our customers, the bank and the economy, we put in place AIB&rsquo;s financial solutions group in 2012.  Today, we continue to have a team of over 1,500 people countrywide in place, guided by the key objective of keeping viable businesses operating, supporting jobs and enabling customers to stay in the family home.<br\/><br\/>We put in place the most extensive range of solutions for customers in the Irish marketplace and decided at that early stage to commence writing off debt as part of these solutions.  Early on, we recognised the need to partner with external organisations to support customers in restructuring loans and enabling them to move on with their personal and business lives.  This approach has resulted in impaired loans reduced from &euro;28.9 billion to &euro;6.3 billion at the end of last year; a 57% reduction on mortgage arrears since 2014; 93% of the mortgage customers meeting the terms of the solutions; and 95% of our wider base adhering to the terms of their restructures.  AIB&rsquo;s solutions are appropriately matched to affordability.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding this progress, supporting customers in difficulty remains a key priority for AIB, and while we do see loan sales as part of our overall plan, our key priority remains to restructure customers on a case by case basis.  We believe it would be important to look at three key areas to give further insight and context as follows: recognise the need for a sustainable banking sector and our commitments to achieving EU norms for non-performing loan, NPL, levels; the scale of restructuring completed at AIB and how this can provide confidence for our customers that through meaningful engagement sustainable solutions can be found; and how we achieve our plans while continuing to support customers in financial difficulty in reaching solutions with the bank.<br\/><br\/>Regarding our commitments to achieving EU norms for NPL levels,<b><\/b>in addition to the importance of the consumer protection imperative when dealing with distressed customers, the bank must also have regard to the European Central Bank, ECB, priority of reducing its stock of NPLs to the EU norm of approximately 5%, that is, &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion in AIB&rsquo;s case, by the end of 2019 &ndash; a fact not exclusive to Irish financial institutions but required of lenders across the eurozone.<br\/><br\/>Regulatory guidance and targets in technical terms address all non-performing exposures, NPEs, which follow the European Banking Authority definition, a broader concept than impaired loans.  This defines non-performing loans based on days past due, that is, greater than 90 days, or where a loan is unlikely to be repaid without full realisation of collateral, regardless of days past due.  Hence, AIB&rsquo;s NPE of &euro;10.2 billion includes the &euro;6.3 billion of impaired loans.  The ECB uses the two terms of NPE and NPL interchangeably.<br\/><br\/>The key issue is that NPLs carry a very high risk weighting and, as a result, require the banks to hold many times more capital for an NPL loan than a performing loan.  This capital requirement on an ongoing basis could limit the flow of new lending into the economy and impact the pricing of that credit resulting in much tighter lending restrictions into the future.<br\/><br\/>As part of the requirement to achieve this normalised level of NPLs, AIB has set out its plans in response to the ECB NPL guidance framework, which required that a defined plan be put in place and implemented in an ambitious timeframe.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On the scale of restructuring completed to date<b>, <\/b>with the need for customer engagement at the core of our approach, solutions were devised and implemented, mainly on a case-by-case restructuring basis, for personal and business customers in difficulty, and overseen by a robust consumer protection framework.<br\/><br\/>In addition, AIB has also engaged with a number of external agencies in an overall approach to help address the problem, including the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, StepChange and iCare.  We are also working with organisations like the Irish Farmers' Association.  Through these advocates, thousands of customers, who were heretofore reluctant to engage with the bank, ultimately achieved a satisfactory resolution of their financial difficulties.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Regarding mortgage debt, the bank has a four-step process to deal with distressed mortgages, known as the mortgage arrears resolution process; this allows bespoke sustainable solutions for each customer in difficulty.  The process has been extremely effective, resulting in 93% of sustainable mortgage resolution agreements continuing to meet their terms.  It is based on open two-way communication between bank and customer, with the expectation of full disclosure of financial information, assessment to determine the customers&rsquo; affordability and resolution to implement the most suitable sustainable solution.<\/p><p>For its part, the bank is prepared to write down debt where there is reduced affordability on the customer&rsquo;s part.<\/p><p> I now turn to the issue of business debt.  The bank&rsquo;s resolution strategy for dealing with business debt begins with an individual assessment of the levels of sustainable and unsustainable debt involved.  Solutions allow the customer to enter into a performance based agreement, typically over a five year period, characterised by the disposal of non-core assets, contribution of unencumbered assets and contribution toward residual debt from available cashflow.<\/p><p> When considering the level of restructuring undertaken to date we must also be fair to the customers who have come forward and restructured.  We have clear examples where customers have restructured and taken on the revised debt and are making the affordable payments while other customers or businesses have not engaged and continue to pay very little or, in some cases, nothing.  This inconsistency is clearly unfair in view of the sacrifices made by the thousands of customers who have already restructured.<\/p><p> I will now outline our approach to reaching normalised NPL levels and to continuing to support customers.  As defined by the ECB, our non-performing exposures, NPEs and non-performing loans, NPLs at the end of 2017 were at &euro;10.2 billion.  This represents 16% of AIB's balance sheet and it compares to EU norms of circa 5%.  This NPE figure is broadly split into two categories, namely, customers who we have resolved subject to a probationary period or completion of property sales before the loans exit from NPE and customers yet to be resolved.<\/p><p> Fortunately, due to the scale and type of restructuring undertaken by AIB we expect that more than &euro;3 billion will exit NPE status as customers complete this probationary period or conclude property sales.  We have a dedicated team working with customers who have restructured to support them in adhering to the terms of their arrangements.  The adherence rate is currently running at 95% and is one of the primary reasons AIB does not see any necessity to sell treated or restructured customer loans.<\/p><p> For the customers whose loans are still to be restructured we continue to have a team working on a case-by-case basis to help resolve their financial difficulties.  We continue to encourage customers to engage with us as this is by far the most expeditious and preferred approach to resolving these difficulties.<\/p><p> As part of our requirement to meet EU norms of circa 5% by end of 2019 we see a role for loan sales.  Our approach has been to focus on the investment loan elements of our portfolio in the first instance, creating time and space for business and family home customers to work with us.  With regard to family homes, a key development has been the launch of the enhanced mortgage to rent scheme with our partners iCare.  This was the result of a significant project over more than 12 months to put in place a potential alternative to a large scale private dwelling home, PDH, portfolio sale.  With the advancement of this solution, a few weeks ago we were able to announce at our financial results for 2017 that our plans to achieve normalised NPL levels does not include the sale of PDH portfolios.<\/p><p> As previously noted loan sales can be one of a number of strategies used to reduce NPLs.  We note the Governor of the Central Bank&rsquo;s recent statements that the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 ensures that relevant borrowers whose loans are sold are afforded the regulatory protections they had prior to the sale.  These include protections provided by the consumer protection code, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the SME regulations.<\/p><p> I reiterate to the committee AIB&rsquo;s absolute commitment to resolving these challenges.  Our continued focus is to work with customers on a case-by-case basis and find resolutions suitable to their circumstances.  Based on our proven track record to date, we can give confidence to customers to come forward and work with us in a meaningful way to resolve their difficulties.  We look forward to contributing to a productive discussion with the Chairman and the committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018032200002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim O'Keeffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1689,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Keeffe.

We did not announce anything about the project until we concluded and knew the project was actually going happen and to work.  We have since implemented the project and as we have begun to see what is coming through the project has allowed us to get to the position where we believe we can work through a considerable amount of the PDH portfolio.

I convey this to the committee, not that it answers the Deputy's other question, but to explain that our position and strategy around this.  We have a very clear plan as to how we are working through this and when we have the evidence at completion we will then communicate this.

How can that work given that there is a 45% USC charge on any bonuses paid to personnel in banks which have been bailed out by the State?  That provision exists in Irish tax law and it means that any bonus paid to either the CEO or any senior official would be subject to an effective tax rate of approximately 89%.

The context of this is essentially that, over a period of three or four years, the bank is normalising.

The bank is normalising to the degree that it will be profitable and able to return all of the Government's investment.  As part of that conversation and as part of the initial public offering, IPO - and this was in the prospectus - the board which determines the remuneration policy for the management and the entire staff wishes to progress towards some form of normalisation of remuneration.  This is part of a long discussion.  The first element of this is simply putting in place a policy which would allow the bank to potentially put in place a scheme.  As we have been normalising, the European Banking Authority has set out, over a number of years, a set of remuneration policy guidelines to which all banks would adhere.  What the bank has started to do is to assemble a first step towards a potential remuneration scheme for senior management which would be compliant with the guidelines.  This is merely a first step in that.  It is not a comment on taxes or the laws of the land.  They remain in place.

There is only one way that deferred bonus scheme can work.

There is no Cinderella clause.  It will continue in Irish tax law indefinitely unless the Irish Parliament wishes to remove it.  Announcing a deferred bonus scheme which could only provide any real benefit to senior executives if this provision was gone was quite arrogant.  I think the bank has overstepped the mark.  Despite whatever cosy little arrangement it has with the Minister of Finance, the bank may know that he is in a minority.  I am not sure if other parties have involved themselves in this arrangement but the Irish Parliament has a tax system that would see the benefit of any deferred scheme limited to 10% of every &euro;1 received as a bonus.

The bank has characterised the sale as largely concerning those who have not engaged but we cannot challenge that because we do not have any information whatsoever and it would appear that if the sale proceeds along the current course, the first those people will hear about it is when they will get a letter informing them that essentially the deal is done and their loan has been sold.  There are people out there running businesses, be it a farm or indigenous small manufacturing firm, and for months their loans have been gone through by funds and assessed through high level and detailed due diligence and the reports in the media are that the process will be done by June.

Part of our frustration with PTSB was its reluctance to give us information when it was in the public domain, and simply to confirm or deny what we are reading.  I understand that paper never refused ink but, as Deputy McGrath outlined, there is a string of reports right across media outlets in relation to this project.  The agenda of today's meeting was to discuss the sale of loans and it is clearly laid out in terms of the business of the meeting today.  I join with Deputies McGrath and Doherty in saying there is a need for AIB to reflect on it and perhaps to come back to us with some sort of detail on the project itself.  Those loans that are tied to a business or some sort of enterprise of one kind or another will not know anything about it, so we have to either tell them that the articles are untrue or that they are true and that they involve the following types of properties, within the loose definition of commercial confidentiality.  We all understand that but we also understand the task that we have to undertake.  Deputies Doherty and McGrath are correct.  We will reflect on what the witnesses have said, or not said, today.  I think AIB should do likewise.  In the interests of providing calm and direction in terms of the marketplace, while protection of confidentiality and commercial sensitivity are important, I think we need information.  That is what has come out of the meeting today.<\/p> <p>  The bank responded to a questionnaire from 13 June 2017 and said in April of that year it would enter into a binding contractual agreement to sell approximately &euro;200 million of funds.  Mr. Bourke alluded to that earlier.  I am sure that in the context of that type of information and what we received earlier from PTSB, the same could be done with AIB.  Let us as two parties to this reflect on the meeting today.  I would love to go into matters more deeply but, unfortunately, time does not permit.<\/p> <p>  The other area I wish to ask about relates to a response the bank has given that no homes are affected but the concern is that businesses are involved.  The bank has been working with iCare and the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation and perhaps others, but we are aware of those I outlined.  A lot of the information the bank has given and the work it has undertaken seems to be positive in terms of how it is progressing all of those things and it is proactive in terms of finding solutions, it is using charities and other organisation outside of the bank to deal with the home loans issue.  I asked PTSB earlier whether it would consider reaching out now beyond that and improving the iCare product or option and exploring new and imaginative ways of dealing with that cohort of customers that still exists on the bank's books in order to keep them in their own home, to give them a sustainable solution in the context of where they are at with the bank and to provide them with some alternative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018032200002#BB00700","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521711000,"counter":1884,"content":"<p>I will respond to that point and then Mr. Bourke will come in on the wider point.

We are very open to engaging with iCare in looking at that, because it is incumbent on us all, and I would hope that if there are solutions for the loans that we would undertake them.

First, I apologise for any frustration that members feel because we did not in any way intend to create frustration.

I will come back to that in a moment.<\/p> <p>  The other point is that we have made, despite any press statements or otherwise, no public statement on any particular portfolio sales.  There may be a lot of potentially precise information, or rather information that looks precise, but we have not made any statement.  Our reason for that kind of approach is that until we are at an advanced position, the potential sale changes massively in terms of its shape.  What we did come to do was to say we continue to look for engagement from individuals where we can restructure.  We have restructured 95% of the &euro;29 billion we have restructured through individual restructurings, and we continue to seek to do that.

I ask the witnesses to understand that.  The bank has not issued any public statement.  That may be the difficulty because now everyone is in a sweat over what is happening to their loan, what is going on and we are being contacted.  We are trying to deal with this in a calm manner.  We are asking the bank to be as constructive as it has been with the other issues that are before us and perhaps come back to us.  The witnesses used the word \"ambition\".

Our role has been to try to inform the discussion on what are complex, controversial and sensitive issues by providing technical, legal information to allow people to make up their own minds from as informed a position as possible.  In doing so we have worked very closely with the Northern Ireland Office, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, a broad cross-section of victims' organisations, ex-combatant groups, former police officers and across civil society, as well as the political parties, to provide solution-based papers and documents to try to help all of the political actors and civil society.<\/p> <p>  In 2014 the Stormont House Agreement proposed four mechanisms to deal with the legacy of the conflict in the North.  We have been waiting for a public consultation process on the legislation to enact its contents.  In 2015 my colleagues and I worked very closely with a parliamentary draftsperson and produced our own best guess of what that legislation might look like in order to help to inform the public debate.  It was launched in the House of Lords in 2015 and called the Model Bill.  We worked very closely with the Northern Ireland Office and others and encouraged the creation of what we think of as a little nerd community which grasps the detail and complexity of all that is involved and has had lots of nerdy conversations with the various actors between the two Governments.  The Secretary of State has told us the consultation process will go public after Easter, but we were told many times before that it was coming.<\/p> <p>  We will list a few headline points for which to look out.  The committee has seen a detailed paper prepared by me and Dr. Bryson on benchmarks to be used in assessing the legitimacy of what is contained in the proposed legislation.  The first is in respect of the Historical Investigations Unit, HIU, the proposed investigative element of the Stormont House Agreement mechanisms, merging the work previously done by the Historical Enquiries Team and the legacy unit of the Police Ombudsman's Office.  Points for which to watch are its level of independence, its capacity to receive information and issues about onward disclosure which I will discuss in the context of national security.  There has been some discussion in the ether, arising, in particular, from an intervention by the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, in a debate that we thought had been resolved, of whether the body should include former RUC personnel in its investigators.  We thought the matter had been resolved because there have been several High Court judgments in recent years - two in 2017 - which, in effect, stated the presence of former RUC officers on the Historical Enquiries Team made the work being done on the cases being addressed unlawful in human rights terms.  It did not comply with the investigative elements of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The leader of the UUP has argued that the inclusion of former RUC officers as investigators in the unit is a political benchmark.  That makes us quite nervous because there have been several judicial interventions which make it clear that it is probably unlawful.  Why would someone seek to legislate for anything that they know is unlawful in the first place?  It looks to us like politicking.  <\/p> <p>  Members will also be aware of the key litmus test in the public debate about the legislation leaked in 2015, prepared by the British Government, which proposed mechanisms to deal with issues of national security, in particular the capacity of the Government to redact information that would be given to families, particularly from the Historical Investigations Unit, and widespread powers for the Secretary of State to redact information on the grounds of national security which, as the committee knows, has no statutory definition.  <\/p> <p>  Rather than just complain about this, we worked closely with other colleagues, particularly NGOs which work with victims of state violence, the constituency potentially most affected by the national security provisions, Relatives for Justice and the Pat Finucane Centre.  We came up with a model wherein a judge would make the final determination on what was or was not a national security consideration.  It is quite technical, but it is important because it was proposed in the legislation leaked in 2015 that if there was an appeals mechanism built into the process in respect of what was or was not a legitimate national security concern, it would be of the standard of a judicial review which, in effect, would say a decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable Secretary of State could have made that determination.  In our view, that is a very high bar; therefore, we proposed a different bar whereby a judge would be involved in making determinations in examining the granular detail of intelligence and other information and making judgments on what were or were not legitimate national security concerns.<\/p><p>I can go into it in some more detail, but that is another benchmark issue for which to look out in terms of the credibility of the proposals made.  <br\/><br\/>The other issue, of which members will be aware and that has been in the ether, is that of a proposed amnesty for state actors.  That was not included in the Stormont House Agreement, but the proposal came from the UK defence select committee last year.  I gave evidence to the select committee.  I have done lots of work internationally on amnesties and their lawfulness and otherwise.  The outworking of that proposal is that in 2018 the Northern Ireland Office indicated that it was minded to include the issue, even though it was not included in the Stormont House Agreement, in the consultation process.  I am given to understand that it featured heavily in the most recent round of failed negotiations.  Again, it is an issue for which to look out.  From my perspective, what it would mean, first, is that we were stepping outside the terms of the Stormont House Agreement.  None of the five local parties argued for its inclusion during the negotiations, nor did the two Governments.  Therefore, No. 1, it is coming from a particular constituency in the Tory Party and elements of the Democratic Unionist Party.  Second, having done the nerdy stuff as a lawyer and looked in some detail at the practical consequences of introducing an amnesty for state actors, it could not be done in a context in which one was trying to exclude truth recovery, namely, the Article 2 investigative truth recovery components of dealing with the past.  If one were to try to have such an amnesty, it would be unlawful, in effect, and against international law.  One could not have an amnesty of that nature which would apply only to state actors.  The legal consequences of such an amnesty, in effect, would be that prosecutions would become impossible for non-state actors.  The chairman of the UK defence select committee, Dr. Julian Lewis, more or less seemed to acknowledge in an article in the <i>Belfast Newsletter<\/i>that he realised it was quite a big ask and would be a high price for victims in North Ireland to pay to accept it, but if it was the price that had to be paid to give protection to state actors who had served in Northern Ireland, they might have to pay it.  From my perspective, that is a huge price for victims to pay because across the community there is a significant demand for justice and prosecutions, although everybody recognises that under the Good Friday Agreement no one serves more than two years for conflict related offences.  Again, this will be a huge issue and everyone will have their eyes on it.  <br\/><br\/>I will hand over to Dr. Bryson to speak about oral history.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018032200002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran McEvoy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521727800,"counter":1911,"content":"<p>I bid everyone a good afternoon.  I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to speak to it.  <\/p> <p>  As Professor McEvoy has said quite a bit about the Historical Investigations Unit, HIU, and the Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, ICIR, among other things, I take the opportunity to highlight some of the key issues related to one of the other mechanisms agreed to under the terms of the Stormont House Agreement, namely, the Oral History Archive, OHA.  I will also touch a little on the Implementation and Reconciliation Group, IRG.<\/p> <p>  In some ways, there has probably been a sense that the Oral History Archive is the least contentious of the mechanisms and perhaps the easiest on which to get some consensus and agreement.  Sometimes that perhaps is based on a misguided assumption that it is a soft or an easy option, but that takes away from the important work it could do, if fashioned correctly.  What I want to say, first, is why I think it matters.  It can do something different from the other mechanisms, in particular, the prosecutorial and truth recovery mechanisms.  It can broaden the canvas for dealing with the past.  We can get to gender related dimensions and rural experiences of conflict to take in the experiences of a very wide range of victims and survivors across Britain and Ireland, all of which is very important.<\/p> <p>  We know internationally about the work of oral history and storytelling mechanisms and how powerful they can be.  Having worked on different projects related to the conflict and served on the advisory boards of oral history projects, I know just how important it can be to provide these opportunities and give voice to people who have been either been silenced, occluded or ignored.  Such projects give space to the messy, complex reality of their experiences that defies monocausal explanations of conflict.  That said and I hope having touched on some of the reasons it matters and is important, what we have been concerned to do is highlight the importance of getting it right and some of the problems we saw in the shape of the mechanism as leaked versions of the draft legislation unfolded and in our tick-tacking with the various key players.<\/p> <p>  First, it was agreed, rightly, in the Stormont House Agreement that the archive should be independent and free from political interference.  I think we all agree that that is vitally important.  That said, we were a little concerned that in the outworking when it began to meet it was tentatively agreed early on that the archive would be housed in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland and, more particularly, that its direction would be guided by the deputy keeper of the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland.  The deputy keeper is the Minister of the parent Department.  That rang a few alarm bells for us in terms of the political independence of the archive.  Although in the draft legislation that was leaked it was suggested the deputy keeper not take direction from the Minister, there were other clauses that said, nonetheless, that all of the rules guiding the functions of the archive, its remit, acquisitions policy and other issues would, in one way or another, be subject to the diktat of the Minister.  That is what we felt amounted to something of a fig leaf of independence.  Overall, it gave the feel of something that was top-down and state-centric.  Looking at truth commissions around the world, we know how easily these mechanisms can be labelled as exclusionary and how people can self-exclude.  If one is to reach out to a broad range of people, one has to get out of the building and engage in the painstaking work of building trust.  To date, that is not something of which the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland would have had a lot of experience.<\/p> <p>  One of the things Professor McEvoy has mentioned is that we have been very pragmatic in our work.  We accepted that we would work within the remit of that which had been agreed to politically.  Accepting that the archive was probably going to be located in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, we said that at least there should be checks and balances.  We looked at what else we could do to curb our fears.  We argued very strongly in favour of a steering group that would hold the deputy keeper to account.  It is very important that it not just be a talking shop and that the steering group have real powers to agree to the remit and vision of the archive and to agree to what can be destroyed, count as being of historical significance and, therefore, admitted into the archive and so forth.<\/p> <p>  On the point of having a bulwark against what could be a case by case fragmented approach, the steering group could play a very important part in mapping out the vision for the archive and how it would deliver on issues related to reconciliation.  That brings me to the link with the Implementation and Reconciliation Group, IRG.  As members are aware, the group is a mechanism that has been designed to establish themes.  It is the big picture.  At the end of five years there would a report on patterns and themes.  That raises two key issues for us.  It is an 11 strong body which is made up of political appointees.  It has been a little vague.  There is not much detail in the Stormont House Agreement about how the academics that will do the grunt work that will create the evidence base for the report on patterns and themes will be appointed or how they will do their work.  I wish to raise two issues in that regard, the first of which relates to the importance of what is in contained the legislation.  Currently, the sense we are getting is that all of the responsibility is on the individual academics to act independently and with the necessary rigour, but we want to ensure the criteria will be established in legislation to ensure the mechanism will be designed in such a way that we will not be in fear of the political appointees saying that although a certain academic is a bona fide academic, he or she should take out paragraph 11 and thus interfere with the work of the academics.  There are plenty of good models for how one can do that.  If I want to be admitted to the arts and humanities research council peer review college or the Royal Irish Academy, there are well established procedures.  There are models which can be followed to establish the criteria to act as a really important brake.<\/p> <p>  The other point I want to raise in relation to the IRG partly concerns how the big picture stuff relates to the evidence base.  This is something that concerned us.  In the Stormont House Agreement it was anticipated that the evidence base to be used in compiling the key report at the end would be referred to the IRG under any of the legacy mechanisms.  In some ways, that makes sense.  If there is a slew of evidence before the ICIR of collusion, for example, one will expect it to be a pattern or theme that will be investigated.  What concerns us is the suggestion that perhaps that it will be applied a little too rigidly and there might come a point where the evidence base could only come from the legacy mechanisms.  If one thinks of collusion, it seems bizarre to us as academics that one might be told that one could not refer to the De Silva review or the Smithwick tribunal report.  Instead we think the academics should have access to all of the relevant and available evidence and that we should trust them to go through the secondary sources, as they would.  That brings me back to my point about the Oral History Archive.<\/p><p>We are getting a sense that an attempt could be made to limit the evidence coming through to inform the vitally important report on patterns and themes.  If that is correct, the point I made about the Oral History Archive matters a great deal because the vision for it - the acquisitions policy and who decides what qualifies as a story of \"historical significance\" - will matter in terms of the evidence base to inform the vital report on patterns and themes.<\/p><p> The next point is linked.  Members will be aware that the Stormont House Agreement includes a reference, albeit only a couple of sentences in length, to the effect that the British and Irish Governments will be expected to make statements of acknowledgement at the end of this process and that others will be expected to do likewise.  However, if we do not get the Implementation and Reconciliation Group right and do not have confidence that the report on patterns and themes has been followed through on correctly, is sufficiently independent and vigorous and so forth, how can the Irish or British Government be asked to apologise, given that the question it will ask is for what is it apologising. <\/p><p> My final point is that all of these elements are organically linked and interdependent and one will have a knock-on effect on the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018032200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anna Bryson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521727800,"counter":1913,"content":"<p>Fortunately, I am the final delegate to speak.  I will not delay the joint committee as I only have a little to add to Dr. Bryson's comments.  <\/p> <p>  My interest in the paper is that everything that happens around victims is turned into a recriminatory process and part of the problem we face is that the reconciliation group needs to ensure it will be brought back to the fundamental purpose set out in the Good Friday Agreement, namely, to enable a future-oriented process, rather than only a past-oriented process.  The location of all of the work of the Historical Inquiries Unit and the Oral History Archive must, therefore, be set out in a charter which will establish much of what Dr. Bryson described in terms of the Implementation and Reconciliation Group, IRG.  Further detail must be given on how the appointment will be made, how active academics will work and the independence of the appointments and reporting processes and full access must be provided to all of the material the IRG will require to make these judgments.  Unless that happens, the risk is that even what we now have, no matter how it is brought forward because of the IRG and whether it will achieve all that it wishes, will turn into yet another recriminatory process and deepen the sense of frustration and alienation.<\/p> <p>  The critical element is focusing on the legislation being brought forward in parliament to ensure it will be put through properly.  Any move to restrict or change what was in contained in the Stormont House Agreement or take it outside the framework of the Agreement which I fear is at risk as a result of the Brexit process, ongoing interference across these matters and the absence of any institution inside Northern Ireland, means that the Irish Government must place particular emphasis on ensuring the legislation will conform exactly with what was agreed to at Stormont House and will be in conformance with what I view as the core of the issue, namely, the statement in the Good Friday Agreement on the purpose of the role of victims.

In the light of the duty to report crime, a republican or a loyalist paramilitary will have a difficulty in trusting the process.

That is an interesting proposal, on which I ask him to elaborate.<\/p> <p>  On the Statute of Limitations, having recently engaged with Dr. Julian Lewis and some of his colleagues on the defence committee at Westminster, I was genuinely astonished by the lack of understanding of what had been proposed in the Stormont House Agreement.  I wondered whether there was even an awareness of what was taking place.  I was also surprised by the extent to which some of those proposing an amnesty were aware that it would mean an amnesty for everybody.  They did not shy away from that point and when it was put to them, they understood exactly what the legally ramifications were.  We will meet the committee again when we travel to London with a range of victims.  It should be an interesting meeting.<\/p> <p>  On the Oral History Archive, about which I spoke recently, is there a good international model for approaching this task?  Archives of this nature have been attempted in the Balkan states and elsewhere.  Are there examples we could consider and can lessons be learned from what has happened elsewhere?<\/p> <p>  I am very worried about the idea of patterns and themes, which brings us back to the issue of an amnesty and the idea that there is somehow a witch hunt under way.  We talk ourselves into themes in public life, which results in the other side arguing that a counter-theme is necessary.  When these themes and counter-themes develop, questions arise about who is in control of them.<\/p><p>I would like to see an archive separate from that and if stories are told, and if it is folklore, so be it.  That is someone's story, and that is it.  It stands alone.  It is in there with everything else.  One of the big things, certainly looking at how we deal with the past, has been the complete lack of gender perspective.  I raised with Judith Thompson when she was in here lately that the failure of the British and Irish Governments to incorporate the North into their national action plans on United Nations Security Council Resolution, UNSCR, 1325 needs to be addressed and the likes of an archive and some of these other structures can help apply that gender perspective.<\/p><p> Apologies, I suppose much of that was rambling thoughts rather than questions.

To some extent, I share the Senator's fears about it becoming quite an anodyne and risk-averse archive.  When the Senator mentions the former combatants, I would stress the ICIR is really the place where people should go with that information.  The oral history archive is not really primarily designed to be the place where ex-combatants would go and tell their story.  However, that is not to say that those issues will not be there.  The Senator quite rightly identified that the Boston College project has engendered a chill factor - it certainly has - but much good work will continue to be done within the confines within which we work.  What we do is train people to understand that there is a limit to that.  One cannot include information about crimes that have not been processed and duly determined and one would reiterate that.  One takes appropriate measures to ensure that does not happen.  To some extent, that perhaps limits some of the stories but going back to the point that has just been made, I would emphasise that the oral history archive is probably about broadening out much more widely and including the stories of a much wider range of people and it should not be a kiss of death to the archive.  At the same time, I would take the Senator's initial point and share my broader sense that if it has this bureaucratic risk-averse approach with little imagination or creative vision, I would worry that that would for different reasons narrow and curb its potential.<\/p> <p>  Does Professor McEvoy want me to go on or does he want to take the next question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018032200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anna Bryson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521727800,"counter":1920,"content":"<p>Sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018032200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran McEvoy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521727800,"counter":1921,"content":"<p>On the point that was made then about folklore, I suppose I would tend to agree with Mr. Hazzard MP that in some ways that is fine because it is people's stories.

It is the job of the historians to come in afterwards and state the lies and the gaps are interesting and they will footnote what actually happened and there is a narrative building up for that individual or for that community, and that is all interesting.  There is a whole lot written about how untruths, gaps and omissions can be interesting for lots of reasons but the point is that it is that person's story, it is his or her interpretation, and it is not a kiss of death to the value of the material if persons misremember for various reasons because it is subjective to an extent.

Deputy Breathnach's question on this arrangement to which families would sign up to it is a good one.  In effect, the mechanism which we did not talk much about, the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval, ICIR, which is in the Stormont House Agreement, is more or less that.  No one knows whether or not that will work.  It is modelled on the commission that was established to recover bodies of those who were disappeared which has basically worked.  There have been 13 bodies returned out of 16.  Deputy Breathnach's constituents would be well aware of this.  That is the model.  The idea, basically, is that the process is triggered by a family member approaching that commission.  In doing so, the family member will be aware that any information that comes back from an armed group or from a state body about what happened to his or her loved one cannot be used for prosecutorial purposes.  All the information in that is sealed and it is designed to help people come to terms with the past.  Whether or not it works we will not know, I guess, until we are roadtesting it.  That is the way that mechanism was designed.  Those families know that any information coming out of that process cannot be used for prosecution.  If evidence emerged from another process, for example, the investigative work of the historical investigations unit, people could still be prosecuted as a result of that, but any information that comes out of the process of the disappeared commission is airtight.  That process will not work unless it is airtight.  One of the reasons, from my perspective, the work of the disappeared commission has been excellent is that the process has been airtight, there has been no leakage and there have been no prosecutions.  That has done a huge amount.  Relationships of trust, in effect, have been built up between armed groups, in particular, the IRA and the INLA, in the recovery of those bodies and those relationships of trust could only happen if the guarantees of non-prosecution were airtight.  That is the way that mechanism is designed.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Breathnach's second question was on cross-Border co-operation.  It is an excellent question also.  We would do a lot of work with victims from across the community.  A big concern for victims in the North, particularly victims from the unionist community, is whether information would be forthcoming about IRA activities that happened south of the Border with people going across the Border and coming back.  It is also a concern for victims here in the Republic.  For example, as the Deputy will be aware, the families of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings have been very frustrated about the lack of information coming from authorities in the North.  Both Governments recognise that for it to work both of them have to apply themselves with goodwill in a cross-Border situation.  In fairness, there has been a significant amount of work done, for example, in terms of the provision of information from the Department of Justice and Equality towards the inquest system in the North and in the development of protocols for the sharing of information, etc.  There is quite a lot of nerd stuff.  There is a lot of logistical work to be done on all of that but these mechanisms will not work precisely and will not have credibility in either jurisdiction unless, as the Deputy hinted at, there is effective and real cross-Border co-operation between the authorities on both sides of the Border.<br\/><br\/>On the statute of limitations question of Mr. Hazzard, it was quite interested that when I gave evidence to that committee I outlined the three components of what an amnesty looks like and the chair of that committee stated that the committee did not like to call it an amnesty and preferred to call it the statute of limitations.  I said that as a lawyer, my view was that if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.  If it negates criminal and civil liability for serious offences, it is an amnesty.  What they are talking about is an amnesty and they know that.  In fairness to that committee, it took the legal and technical arguments about the consequences if one introduces that.  One simply cannot, for example, as I stated earlier, introduce a statute of limitations which negates people's right to truth under Article 2 of the investigative elements of that.  Second, if one is doing this, one must know that one is saying that it would be very difficult to mount any successful prosecution against the non-state actors, loyalists and republicans, because of the legal arguments for the introduction.  That style of an amnesty is called a self-amnesty.  It is the kind of amnesty that was introduced by the military dictatorships in Argentina, in Chile and in Brazil.  Indeed, Robert Mugabe introduced a similar style of self-amnesty for ZANU-PF activists.  That is the kind of company one is keeping with this version of a self-amnesty.  Courts will obviously look at that, look at the context of what one is doing there and judge it accordingly.  Then if anyone tries to mount a prosecution, for example, of a non-state actor in the context of such an amnesty, of course, the lawyers who are representing the non-state actor in that context will talk about equality of arms and collusion.  They will raise all the issues which will make it, in effect, impossible to successfully prosecute non-state actors.  That honest conversation with victims, which, in fairness, Dr. Julian Lewis was having, is the realm that we are in.  In some ways what one saw in this debate was, while some of the DUP MPs were pushing hard on this issue, there was a degree of blow back from some elements.  For example, I saw some correspondence from a victims' organisation which is called the innocent victims network in Northern Ireland which became understandably concerned that the consequences of the DUPs MPs pressing for this for those victims would be that, as far as they are concerned, IRA terrorists would never be successfully prosecuted as a result of this amnesty.  There is probably a bit of political pressure coming from grassroots unionist victims' groups on the DUP and the Ulster Unionist Party around this issue.  I do not know where that will play out.  We are talking here about is a self-amnesty which will have the consequence of a <i>de facto <\/i>amnesty for non-state actors as well.  If we are to have conversation with victims, honesty is the key to all of this in terms of public credibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018032200002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran McEvoy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521727800,"counter":1923,"content":"<p>Sitting beside lawyers is always an interesting experience for me because the nerds take over and they know more than I do, namely, the facts.<\/p><p>As somebody who thinks of this politically and has worked in the community for a long time, my concern about all of this is that as we get more technical, the restorative purposes in terms of the reason we are doing it may be lost.  In terms of the purpose of this process, we need to shift the focus, and this is why the Implementation and Reconciliation Group, IRG, is critical, away from the prosecutorial to the restorative by which I mean that the critical issues in restorative justice are addressing harm, taking responsibility and restoring relationships afterwards.  If we do not shift from a punitive to a restorative model, effectively, all of this will go down the toilet, so to speak, in the way mentioned earlier, which is that the themes will become recriminatory and people will say that certain individuals got amnesties and others could not be prosecuted.  We can see that rolling out in front of us already.<\/p><p> Alongside the very important work on detail, which I am not \"dissing\" in any way, something has to be said about re-establishing the reason we are doing this.  It is not to drag it out of anybody.  It is essential that we address these matters.  The word is \"reconciliation\" but the focus should be on the future, not the past.  The point about reconciliation is that it is possible to move from somewhere to somewhere else, and that has to be facilitated.<\/p><p> On the fundamental issues raised, the question in Northern Ireland, or the North of Ireland if the members prefer that term, is control of the narrative.  In any of these issues, control of the narrative has to be addressed.  As far as it is possible for us to do, we must move on to a more objective, measurable, challengeable process.  That means it must be judicially challengeable but also, in terms of the oral archive, that the principles are established at the outset and can be challenged and measured.<\/p><p> Mr. Hazzard spoke about the folklore.  There is very good academic work on how to do oral history.  It is not just a case of somebody explaining what happened to them in a wee corner of a booth.  It needs to be done properly.  It has been pioneered internationally but it has also been done quite well by local community organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018032200002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Duncan Morrow","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521727800,"counter":1925,"content":"<p>I think Dr. Bryson literally wrote the book on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018032200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran McEvoy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521727800,"counter":1926,"content":"<p>Exactly.  The critical issue for me is that at some level there needs to be a visible willingness to stand back from the political control of the narrative because if it is only about that, the process will enter disrepute even before it starts.  There is a political imperative to acknowledge that that is an issue, to say that this is what we are doing and then, at some level or other, to stand back from that.  The best thing we have are international judicial standards of evidence gathering from academia and professional standards monitored by professionals who are able to then uphold whether they are being followed. If we do not go down that road, all the mechanisms we have will fall back into the political control.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Hazzard asked me specifically about the commemoration issue.  I have been thinking that commemoration is also about the control of the narrative.  At some level or other it is part of this process, but it is never addressed.  The right to remember is given in the agreement but it is also about how we remember in a society in which harm is a complex process to be understood in multiple ways.  Are there ways that would allow us move forward and say, &quot;This and no further&quot;?  Could this be an agreed way that would not be used simply as a mechanism for further politicisation by any side but that we would have some kind of protocols?  That would also ride into how we do our cultural celebration and address the &quot;How to&quot; question.<br\/><br\/>We would have to be compliant with human rights in the context of freedom of expression but in a divided society a very good case could be made that there should be at least a charter of norms that people can be held against that would allow everybody, with some degree of freedom, move forward on that issue without more victimisation and retraumatisation.  I fear that this process threatens to become one of retraumatisation.  That is the reason everything goes back to &quot;Let us not talk about it at all&quot;, which means it festers and comes out in other ways.<br\/><br\/>The critical issue for me is that the pathways are established and the Implementation and Reconciliation Group is given a proper remit to report on the process more than every five years in terms of whether it is being upheld, whether the question of independence is being upheld and so on to ensure some assurance is being given to people through the entire process.  If we are talking about real risks rather than theoretical or legal risks, the entire process will become nugatory if it becomes another <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre<\/i>for how a state or any particular group tried to nobble it for its own purposes.<br\/><br\/>My emphasis in all of this would be the oral history archive, in terms of the historical investigations unit, HIU, and ensuring that the IRG is given sufficient oversight potential to ensure it upholds the standards set out in law and in the Stormont House Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018032200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Duncan Morrow"},{"type":"speech","time":1521727800,"counter":1927,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Morrow for being so frank, even though he is painting an extremely depressing picture in that, after all these years and all the initiatives, the organisations, the units, the funding and everything that has gone into it, we do not seem to be further advanced.

Some of us are involved with the issue of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and it is very difficult to listen to the relatives of the victims.

The time and resources that went in to ensuring that family did not get next or near the truth are immoral.  We hear people talking about the cost of these court cases, inquiries and so on.

They are stark and unfortunately present a very accurate picture of the position we are in.  Professor Morrow's statement that after 20 years we must conclude that we have collectively and individually failed to take the Good Friday Agreement seriously is a fairly damning statement but unfortunately an accurate one.  Dr. Bryson referred to omissions and to people mis-remembering.  Professor Morrow said the supply of truth is even shorter on the ground.  As time goes on, even when people want to tell the truth, memories can be dimmer because people's memories fade.  They may not be as accurate as they wish they were.  Every day that goes past it is getting more difficult to establish a just process in regard to legacy issues.  In our last visit to the Wave trauma centre in Belfast we met victims and advocates for the victims.  There are people there who have been without any proper appreciation of their huge injuries and suffering.  They have had no proper health service, pensions or disability payments.  It is absolutely appalling that for decades these people have suffered and continue to suffer.  The one political mandate all of us in the 32 Counties have is to implement the Good Friday Agreement.  It was endorsed by more than 94% of the people in our State and by more than 72% of the people in Northern Ireland.  It was a huge political mandate for the people in public life, both North and South, to implement.  I fear that as time goes on people, understandably, will become ever more disillusioned.  The truth diminishes when the memories of people who want to be truthful fade.  We had that discussion with the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains.  Every day that goes by memories are lost and people pass away to their eternal reward.  There are family members who will never see any truth or secure any justice for the loss or suffering of loved ones.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Bryson mentioned tragedies not being investigated in this jurisdiction.  My colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, referred to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  I represent Cavan-Monaghan.  What has happened is appalling.  On three occasions, the D&aacute;il unanimously passed motions calling on the British Government to give access to eminent international legal experts to all papers and files pertaining to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  Successive British Governments, to their eternal shame, have ignored the pleas of sovereign parliaments from a neighbouring jurisdiction.  It is absolutely appalling that the British Government has treated these matters in this way.  In my immediate area, a bombing resulted in the death of two young teenagers in Belturbet, County Cavan, in December 1972.  There has been no co-operation from the authorities in Northern Ireland.  People have pointed the finger at who was responsible for that carnage on that dreadful night.  <\/p> <p>  On a day like this, I also want to remember Aidan McAnespie.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, arranged for Aidan's father, John and two brothers, Vincent and Sean to make a presentation to us here today.  There is unanimous agreement at the justice committee that a report that was carried out by Assistant Commissioner Crowley would be released to the family.  There are many cases of justice being delayed for families and the truth being kept from them for decades.  It is important that we reflect on the fact all of us are getting older by the day and people continue to suffer.  It is an appalling situation.  <\/p> <p>  With the political institutions not working in Northern Ireland, are the Fresh Start agreement and the Stormont House Agreement dormant for all intents and purposes?

I will address those asked by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and Ms Michelle Gildernew.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked whether we could draw on the international experience of other jurisdictions.  She mentioned Rwanda and Cambodia.  I have worked in both of them and ten or 12 other places.  The way we went about our work in trying to feed into these debates in Northern Ireland was to see where we could draw on lessons.  One cannot transpose the model from one place to another.  That is common sense.  What we have worked on is bespoke solutions for bespoke problems.  On issues like Rwanda in particular Dr. Bryson spoke about the dangers of State-centricity.  In Rwanda there was a big focus on community-driven justice and community-driven approaches to the past.  That fed into our thinking about the prominence of civil society in all of these discussions.<\/p> <p>  I detect a strain of pessimism in the questions Deputy Smith and Deputy O'Sullivan asked.  I do not agree with it.  The consultation on this legislation will be a defining moment in how mature our civil society is.  The last time we had a moment like this, which some may remember, was the launch of the Eames-Bradley process - which was a debacle - and what ensued afterwards.  Our civil society was not up to the task in terms of dealing with it and having mature and sensible conversations around these issues.  I think we are in a different place now.  We have better leadership across the victim sector.  I do not think victims can be as easily manipulated politically as they were.  Time will tell.  There was a question about whether all these things are dead in the water.  They are not, but this is our last chance.  Assuming this consultation goes forward and assuming it is also followed up by legislation - those are two big assumptions - we are at a defining moment in the history of coming to terms with the past on the island.  We will see whether our civil society can hold up.  I am more optimistic than I used to be about our capacity to have grown-up, sensible conversations on these issues.  I just finished a project in which we did 60 interviews with victims from across the political spectrum.  There are significantly increased levels of maturity and reflectiveness among victim activists so we will see whether we are up for this.  I am an optimist by nature.  We are in a better place than we were when the Eames-Bradley process was launched.<\/p> <p>  Ms Gildernew and Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the national security and redactions and so on.  That is how we have approached the conversations with the Northern Ireland office in particular.  A community with a history of seeing redactions made by the British State, in particular, is being told to trust the British State that it is because of a legitimate national security concern.  There is no abundance of trust in our jurisdiction.  That is a political reality that we must face.  We approach it in a very problem-solving kind of way.  As I said earlier, we came up with this model which was supported by the two key NGOs working with families of victims of State violence which said families could live with this model.  The model accepted that states have legitimate national security concerns but it is not a blank cheque.  Looking at a way in which we could break that down, we said no one really has a problem with the State's obligations to protect lives.  Naming names in reports that could lead to reprisals is a very big test to pass.  The Ombudsman does it all the time and goes through the process of reflecting on his office's Article 2 responsibility.  It is not beyond our legal imagination to find ways of squaring the circle.  That is one thing.  No one really has an issue with protecting lives.  We will park that.  The right to protect life is one issue.  If a judge was making a determination and the interest of families were represented - probably in a closed legal hearing because it is very sensitive information - the arguments would be knocked back and forward and the judge makes a determination against particular criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018032200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran McEvoy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521727800,"counter":1932,"content":"<p>One cannot use national security to protect unlawful activities.

A judge, making a determination after legal arguments back and forward, could say: \"Come on lads, that is not a legitimate counter-terrorist practice.\"  We could, however, have a sensible, grown-up conversation within a legal process for that.  All of these issues are resolvable with a degree of legal imagination and political will.  I believe that the national security issue is one of those, but it will require political will.  It will probably be the issue where we will really see whether the British Government is serious about seeking to address the past.  It is a touchstone issue and it goes well beyond Northern Ireland; it is across the British State.  The read-across implications for the Ministry of Defence, MI5 and MI6 are something that the Northern Ireland Office really must consider.  This has read-across consequences.  We thought of a way of possibly including on the face of the legislation text such as:  \"For the purposes of dealing with the past in Northern Ireland the following criteria shall be used to assess what is or is not a legitimate national security concern.\"  None of these issues is irresolvable.  With goodwill and a bit of legal imagination we could actually do this.  I am not pessimistic in the way others are.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the gender issue, which is a very important point.  One of the flaws in the Stormont House Agreement is the fixation and exclusive focus on deaths.  Some members of this committee will have met people who have been seriously injured who are campaigning for pensions.  It is a disgrace on our body politic that we have been unable to resolve that.  Again, with a degree of political imagination this issue is very resolvable.  We have worked with colleagues in the women's movement in Northern Ireland who are very exercised by the lack of energy directed towards gender-based issues.  If we only focus on deaths in the conflict and if through the mechanisms, for example from the oral history archive, a pattern or theme of domestic violence or gender based crimes is established or comes forward to the Implementation and Reconciliation Group, IRG, are we seriously going to tie the hands of the group by saying that in the 21st century a dealing with the past mechanism is not going to address gender-based violence?  That would be out of sync by 30 years with truth commissions and any other bodies who deal with these issues.  Are we going to rule out dealing with the seriously injured because of our focus in the Stormont House Agreement on the deaths?  During discussions on this when we were coming up with the model Bill, our solution was that in addition to the focus on deaths in the conflict a degree of space would be created for the directors of the different mechanisms and if there was an overriding and compelling public interest the director of the oral history archive, for example, could suggest doing more on gender violence or looking more at the issue of torture - which is a very topical issue.  People may not have died due to torture but it is a significant theme and pattern within our conflict, from both State and non-State actors.  Sensible people would be appointed to the directorates of those institutions and given a degree of flexibility with issues of an overriding public interest.  This would allow them to go beyond just the deaths.  Again, this issue is resolvable with a bit of imagination. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018032200002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran McEvoy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521727800,"counter":1933,"content":"<p>I wish to add a comment on gender.  I suspect it will not be overruled.  I wholeheartedly agree with the point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan, and it was also raised by Mr. Hazzard, that the Oral History Archive is a space where we could do a lot more around gender issues. Consider the witness statements that were collected in this jurisdiction in the late 1940s and 1950s and how profoundly they have influenced the writing of the history of the revolution and the Civil War period, and rightly so.  It has provided really rich material.  Some 8% of the statements were from women.  When we consider how skewed and distorted some recollection can be, it brings in to sharp relief the importance of that type of collection.  People do not line up outside the public records office.  There will be no orderly queue formed that is duly representative of themes and patterns as mentioned, or representative of the experiences of women.  A lot of work has to go in to actually making it happen.<\/p> <p>  Following on, if the Chairman does not mind, I would also link this back to Mr. Hazzard's query about international examples.  I have spent a lot of time looking at what has been done in this regard in countries such as Croatia, and if there were models of such situations in the South African archive and so on that we could draw on.  UN Special Rapporteur Pablo de Greiff, who was very keen that not been enough attention had been paid to the archive and so on, pointed me to a project in Galicia in Spain called Names and Voices.  It has a distinct gender project within it.  It is hard to find one project, other than knowing that the political interference in the top-down State-centric archives are not necessarily where we want to look to.  I was looking for a model rather than a specific project.  Sometimes it is easy to lose sight of things.  A lot of good work has been done in collecting women's and families' stories.  Some of it is becoming obsolete because there is nowhere for the material to be stored and it is in people's drawers.<\/p> <p>  Much powerful cross-community work is being done by community groups telling really important stories.  A lot has been happening at community level.  Perhaps part of what we need to look at is aggregator models, such as in the United States of America with the digitisation of the public library, which is almost like a franchise model, for example like McDonalds, with legal and ethical standards.  Dr. Morrow is correct that there would be very specific professional standards.  We would need specific standards around working with vulnerable people and victims.  At the same time, one does not want to constantly reinvent the wheel.  We want to find a way of working.  A train the trainer module was part of that.  This happens in transitional justice all the time with the collecting of new stories, but what about working with people and harvesting the statements? There is a fear by many of these organisations, whose funding is now being cut, that a big oral history archive in the public records office is like Tesco or Walmart coming to town.  There is a terrible fear that we are going to be hoovered up.  We need to be mindful of that.  I did not find a specific project.  In one of the articles I referenced I went through a number of different international projects and I critiqued them, but it is probably more instructive to look at some kind of model, such as the aggregator model used in the digitisation of the public libraries in the United States of America that enables us to work with and through existing groups.<\/p> <p>  We also have to acknowledge that a former RUC officer is going to be more comfortable telling his story to a former colleague who has been trained.  We need to find ways of acknowledging that some victims want to talk to certain people who they trust, perhaps with and through their advocate support worker as we have proposed.  All of this could be looked at.  We could find a more sophisticated model that would enable us to do all of this.  This came to mind when Deputy O'Sullivan spoke of the importance of collecting the stories of women.  Some of this has already been done and we do not want to lose it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018032200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anna Bryson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521727800,"counter":1934,"content":"<p>This reinforces the absolute certainty that without the involvement of community-based organisations in the collection of the Oral History Archive I do not think it will come off the ground at all.  I do not believe this is simply a centralised professional model.  There are professional standards and practices that have to be applied but the engagement of local agents, and also the people doing the recordings and the actual interviews and the work, is, in many cases, critical to people's willingness to speak.  One of the consequences of conflict is not simply the consequence for the individual victim; it is about trust and the absolute catastrophe of trust leaving and, therefore, one has to have a person who is a trusted intermediary to whom these people can speak.  We must be very clear about this; the Oral History Archive is going to have to be a delicately constructed process that allows people to enter it different points, but the standards have to be central.  That is a start.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect goes back to the question of the Good Friday Agreement.  There is the assumption that this only works if it is seen as the reading in to practice of a commitment already given to the Good Friday Agreement, that it does not exist independently, that dealing with the past only exists in relation to the decision to make a peace process and that a political commitment is there to make it work.  Other than that I do not believe it exists independently, or it fits in to the politics of its time - which are different politics.  The issues we are dealing with, therefore, are not just technical.  They are the profound political crisis that was referred to earlier here; are we still really on this process at all?  I am a bit more pessimistic than Professor McEvoy but, like him, I believe that this is a test case.<\/p><p>One could turn that around.  The test case will show what kind of process of dealing with the past we actually come up with.  Does it begin to deal with people's need for truth, as has been referred to?  Does it begin to access pensions as a real possibility?  Does it begin to deal restoratively with the real harms?  Does it try to find ways to do so?  This is about finding ways.  It cannot simply be a control process.  It must be a process which throws up questions about what we are going do subsequently. <br\/><br\/>I want to touch on the notion of restorative practice around the themes.  People think about these themes in a very politicised, historical or political way.  That is probably my own way of doing it academically.  Nevertheless, we also need to think of these themes as social themes.  One example is gender.  The way in which people of different genders experienced conflict, harm and the consequences of these things, and the way they coped, is a massively important theme which needs to be explored and opened.  There are other themes like it.  The intergenerational theme seems to be really quite serious.  What have the consequences been?  We are seeing patterns of suicide and trauma in the second generation.  There is no doubt whatsoever that the consequences of losing a parent or relative in that context were massively important for those around the loss.  That is another theme.  <br\/><br\/>Locality is a theme.  Northern Ireland, or the North of Ireland, is not a single unit.  Neither is the jurisdiction across the Border.  There are real issues arising from patterns of locality.  The conflict has had very specific and profound effects on the way places operate, which we have to deal with.  I refer to mental health.  Mental health, and the way in which we are now able to use trauma in the mental health framework, could be an escape valve.  It could also be a way to throw light on the real harms.  This is linked to issues around domestic abuse and other patterns.  That would be very interesting and important to look at.<br\/><br\/>Possibly along with intergenerational themes, the issue of gender is probably the critical one that would open the conflict up.  It would allow us to see it not simply as an experience for a small, narrow group of people, but as something with consequences which engage everybody.  This is not just the victims asking for something.  This is us coming to terms with the extremely complicated legacy of the past around the Border.  That would also allow the questions of who is being served and what services are about to be much more open questions.  It would allow these questions to be mainstreamed across health, education and all the different areas affected.  For me, that is important.  <br\/><br\/>I am no longer on it, but I sat for 20 years on the Sentence Review Commission.  I was a sentence review commissioner.  This was the process through which early relief of prisoners was managed in the Good Friday Agreement.  When I went on it, I remember thinking that in a sense it was the best available political compromise that we could have.  It allowed for the two-year minimum sentence for conviction, and at the same time it allowed people to say that those who were released continued to hold licences.  The life sentence prisoners all continued to hold licences.  This was all right as a step.  However, we need to complete the question of what transition we expect.  Are people who were released to be ex-prisoners always, or is there a mechanism through which they can be, returned and restored to the community?  We need to think about all of those steps as part of making our violent conflict something which belongs to an identifiable period, rather than a continuing reality which continues to infect and affect absolutely everything that happens.  <br\/><br\/>I will return to the issue of the Good Friday Agreement.  I refer to it all the time, but I contend that the second paragraph of the Agreement, which in practice is essentially the first paragraph, sets a tone which now appears terminally naive and romantic.  That is what worries me.  It says:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;The tragedies of the past have left a deep and profoundly regrettable legacy of suffering. We must never forget those who have died or been injured, and their families. But we can best honour them through a fresh start [which is paradoxical, since we had to have another one in 2015], in which we firmly dedicate ourselves to the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance, and mutual trust, and to the protection and vindication of the human rights of all.&quot;<\/blockquote><p>When people say that the Good Friday Agreement has been superseded, I am less focused on specific institutions than on that.  I want to know if we are setting that aim aside.  Is that gone?  Are we no longer aiming at those particular aims?  We now talk in Northern Ireland of outcomes-based accountability.  For all the institutions and legal frameworks that seem to flow from the Agreement, the outcome has to be reconciliation, tolerance, mutual trust, and the vindication of human rights of all.  If that is not the outcome then the processes are all distortion.  Everything that we do should have that at the beginning.  The test of viability of these things needs to go back to those aims.  That is a slightly naive and silly thing to say at this point.  However, it strikes me that given the hiatus in the institutions that we currently have, the restoration of the institutions should not simply be about the restoration of the institutions.  The restoration of the institutions has to be about the renewal of their purpose as well.<br\/><br\/>My concern is not that the institutions have gone, but that the purposes underpinning them have been lost.  Under the aegis of those purposes, it would be possible for politicians to argue in favour of making certain decisions in their own communities.  Those decisions may appear difficult, but they are in pursuit of a higher cause to which everyone has signed up, a cause which is contained in the Good Friday Agreement.  If that framework is lost, it becomes increasingly difficult for politicians in any political party to argue that they are acting in the best interests of their communities and that those interests are actually articulated in the Agreement.<br\/><br\/>I am only labouring this point because I know it is about victims today.  If that is lost, I predict that all of this will become another recriminatory process.  That will be manifest in the failings and the limitations of the legislation, the way in which people are handled and their degree of trust in the Oral History Archive.  There is something here which is not just legal.  It require us to invest a certain amount of political capital.  It requires us to ensure that what comes out of these is aligned to that purpose.  That is complex in the current situation, but I nevertheless want to put it back into the equation.  If it is not, I fear that some of this is simply talking for the sake of feeling that we can do this.  The outcomes will not be what we want.  This will not be outcome-based.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018032200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Duncan Morrow","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521727800,"counter":1936,"content":"<p>I will keep it very short.

There is always a complex relationship between civil society and the political elected class because there is always a degree to which people who are not elected wish to be taken more seriously than they feel they are.  Unless there is a wider conversation in society it just becomes far too narrow.  We may now be reaching a point where that is consistently the case.  However, there are mechanisms there.  PEACE IV exists.  The International Fund for Ireland still has funds.  There is a Community Relations Council.  The Victims Commissioner has a role.  There are all sorts of things.<\/p> <p>  Politicians have seriously argued that they need to hear a more mature conversation in civil society and would like to see that being fostered and owned.  Some of that involves having a space for risk and for a complex and open political conversation, and a renewed space, what used to be called a \"safe space\", to discuss this kind of stuff.  It is a complex issue and must be done in different places, and what is safe for one person may not be safe for another and so on.  Nevertheless, there is a genuine need at this point to improve the quality of the dialogue, its complexity, its evidence base and its emotional intelligence, which would introduce a context within which an oral history archive, truth recovery or even the question of investigation starts to look like an answer.  I do think that platform should now be formally encouraged because it is not coming through in the media.

Specifically on the timescale, I will give an idea of the best-case scenario.  If the British Government puts the legislation out for consultation after Easter as it has suggested, the consultation period would be completed by the end of June.  Then the British Government would give a response to that in September so that legislation could be tabled in the House of Commons by November.  That could be through the Houses by May 2019 and institutions would be live by winter 2019.  That is with political will, with the Brexit parliamentary timetable for tabling legislation, and all those issues.  The best-case scenario timescale is that the mechanisms are live by winter 2019.<br\/><br\/>I agree with Mr. Hazzard on the civil society space, particularly in the media.  On the project I mentioned earlier where we have done a lot of work with victims, one thing we have done is looked at how victims are treated by the media and their experiences of the media.  We have been interviewing them about that.  One thing we will produce from that, working with the very well-known and well-respected journalist, Susan McKay, is a set of guidelines which we hope print and broadcast media will sign up to, which will outline how they promise to treat victims.  We will launch that at a conference on victims and legacy which will take place in Queen's University Belfast in May.  It arises precisely because of the issues which Mr. Hazzard addressed, with people being baited and retraumatised.  Nothing can be compulsory, but our idea has been to talk to victims about their experiences and look at analogous guidelines.  For instance, there are interesting guidelines on how the media should treat the victims of suicide, doing so respectfully.  It is about putting some meat on that and establishing an architecture around the respectful and ethical treatment of victims.  We are in the middle of doing that.  <br\/><br\/>Mr. Hazzard is correct that historically there have been very antagonistic relationships between victims from different sectors of the community.  However, in the past year, in particular, there have been improved relations in different sectors of the community.  The victims forum, a body which was set up and is overseen by the victims commission, is functioning much more effectively.  Myself and my colleagues, Dr. Cheryl Lawther and Dr. Lauren Dempster conducted a workshop event in partnership with the victims commission where we had victims from across the sector, with very different experiences and community backgrounds.  However because they were in the shared space in speaking about their experience of the media we got very interesting discussions with people of very different political perspectives agreeing on the same things.  I am more optimistic on the capacity for agreement, with a bit of leadership across the political divide and within civil society and among the victims themselves.  <br\/><br\/>On prisoners and former combatants, members will be aware of issues around people who have been seriously injured and the question of pensions.  That issue has been hung up on there being a very small number of former combatants who may potentially qualify for a pension because they were seriously injured.  It would not require a huge amount of imagination to have parallel processes whereby ex-combatants were treated as ex-combatants and their needs were addressed and met as such, the kind of thing to which Professor Morrow referred earlier, while victims were treated distinctly and differently.  That takes one out of the politics of the definition of victims and treats ex-combatants as ex-combatants and addresses their needs as such.  My colleague, Dr. Luke Moffett and I wrote a blog on <i>Sluggerotoole.com <\/i>a while ago suggesting a model precisely around this and we will be holding some meetings in coming weeks on the matter.  We are talking about a very small number of ex-combatants.  It is the politics of victimhood that have prevented this from happening.  I have friends and colleagues who are among the seriously injured and it is an absolute disgrace on our body politic that that issue has not been addressed and has been politicked, as the victims would be the first to tell the committee.  I am sure they have done so.<\/p><p>It is a disgrace.

One will now see in victims and survivor services, VSS, intergenerational projects coming to the fore.<\/p> <p>  I would add that it is an area where the oral history archive can play a particularly important role because it is not time bound.  The Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, ICIR has to do the Implementation and Reconciliation Group, IRG within five years.  They are very much time bound.  It is the one that can take that longer view and can acknowledge that people's stories unfold.  Within families, they unfold.  One might want to revisit the same story.  Alan McBride will tell one that he was frozen as the Shankill bomb widower, that was his story in the media; that was how he was positive and when he engaged in that kind of storytelling work, he was able to put it in the longer context that he grew up in a loyalist estate in north Belfast.  He stated that was important but it happened over a period of time.  One can see then, when one has that facility, younger people can respond to that within the same family.

I am accompanied by Mr. Paul Hogan, who is the project manager for the NPF, and Ms Alma Walsh, one of our team of planning advisers.  Our remarks focus on the national planning framework aspect of Project Ireland 2040, including its linkages as well with the national development plan, NDP, under the overall banner of Project Ireland 2040.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee will be well aware, the NPF sets a long-term strategic planning framework for Ireland over the next 20 years, setting out some key principles in relation to better managing the future population growth of 1 million extra people, an extra over 660,000 people at work and an additional 500,000 extra homes required.<\/p> <p>  The big innovation in Project Ireland 2040 is the integration of planning with future capital investment.  Crucially, the NPF and the ten year NDP investment strategy have been fully aligned.  There is a &euro;116 billion capital investment programme.  Both the programme and the planning framework are founded on ten national strategic outcomes shared between both documents and designed to: deliver more balanced and sustainable regional development; timely enhancement of the infrastructure required to meet the needs of the country; and meet challenges and headwinds, including climate change, Brexit and so on.  We have worked very closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and we are very confident that all the planned capital investment under the NDP will directly or indirectly support the achievement of the strategic outcomes.  From our Department's point of view, particular headline elements of the NDP, from a planning point of view, include the establishment of the national regeneration and development agency and &euro;3 billion of investment in urban and rural regeneration and development funding, which will particularly support the NPF's aims around compact urban development and the continued development and vitality of rural communities, particularly smaller towns and villages that face a lot of challenges today.  Progression of these initiatives is a particular priority for us in terms of implementation in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to that broader issue of implementation.  Subsequent to its publication a little more than a month ago, our Department has now written to all local authorities, regional assemblies and An Bord Plean&aacute;la notifying them that the NPF constitutes national planning policy in accordance with section 2 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and all other relevant provisions of the Act.  Also, recognising that the NPF is the first part of a broader updating of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic planning policy frameworks to be followed by preparation of regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs, of which members will be aware, our team has spent much of its time since the launch sitting down with the regional assemblies, the local authorities as well as a broad range of other interested stakeholders, addressing their questions, their queries and so on and seeking out views in relation to building a comprehensive implementation strategy.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee will also be aware, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 is currently on Committee Stage in the Seanad and will, in line with the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, put in place a statutory process for the regular review and updating of the national planning framework, much as is the case for other tiers of Ireland&rsquo;s planning policy hierarchy at present.  Moreover, to ensure a swift and coherent translation of the content of the NPF and regional spatial and economic strategies into the statutory local authority development plans, which, as the committee members will know, can take several years to come up for review depending on when their preparation was commenced, there is an amendment in the Bill to recalibrate development plan review timings to ensure that imminent reviews are held over until such time as the updated policies and metrics from the NPF, the RSES process and so on are available and that plans adopted in recent years also are brought in for variations to update them accordingly.<\/p> <p>  With the initial briefings and stakeholder engagement being almost complete, and necessarily that was quite an intensive programme.  We sat down, directly or indirectly, with all the 31 local authorities and so on.  We are now moving into more strategic issues in relation implementation, including working directly with the regional assemblies and the local authorities in terms of the preparation and the conclusion of the regional spatial economic strategies by or shortly after the end of this year.<\/p><p>Another priority is to develop an effective framework with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure implementation as part of the wider Project Ireland 2040 process and the associated governance and oversight.  This includes arrangements for cross-departmental and stakeholder co-ordination.  Meetings will take place today and in the coming weeks in that regard.  The gathering of key data and monitoring systems is important.  We have significant brownfield development targets and we have to develop the way we measure them in practice.  We need to ensure that the data gathering process feeds in to the overall implementation process to create an agile, responsive and outcome-based implementation approach.<\/p><p> We need to work on the development of the options and on putting in place arrangements for the establishment of the national regeneration and development agency.  We have to finalise certain operational and evaluation elements of the proposed regeneration and development funds in conjunction with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The process includes taking on board views of relevant stakeholders, such as the local authorities, which will ultimately administer these funds.<\/p><p> We are a little over a month into the implementation of a strategy that looks out over the next 20 years.  Although we are at an early stage in the implementation process, it is gathering pace.  I wish to emphasise that we welcome the views of the committee on these and related matters.  The committee has provided great assistance to us in the past with committee input for the national planning framework.  We are before the committee as much to discuss the different issues or different emphasis that the committee may wish to see in the implementation process.  We are happy to come back on these areas as we develop more detail on the implementation process.  Mr. Hogan, Ms Walsh and I are happy to take any questions or discuss any issues that committee members may wish to raise with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1955,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cussen and the team for coming in today.  We have gone through much of this ground ourselves.  I can only speak for myself in the Seanad but I know it is the same in the D&aacute;il.  On a personal level, I welcome the national planning framework and the plan.  I believe it is a positive plan.  The national strategic outcomes envisaged are all positive.  We talk about compact growth, enhanced regional accessibility, strengthening and empowering rural economies and sustainable mobility.  I am keen to touch on some of the issues, including: the need for a strong economy; supporting enterprise, innovation and skills; rural housing and urban housing; and how to operate within the master plan.  Certainly, some people will not be happy with it, but at least it is a plan and something that is committed.  It is not all going to materialise.  It is like any county development plan in that it does not all happen, but at least it can be amended, adjusted or tweaked.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  Under the plan we refer to enhanced zones.  The Department has dealt comprehensively with amenities, heritage and transport.  I am supportive of the general broad outcome and the national strategic objectives of the plan.  However, when we consider the strategic investment priorities things get a little more complex and that is important to note.  We know we have to increase some areas.  We have a housing crisis and we have to increase housing.  The planners have referred to that and to sustainable development, urban development and rural development.  I have dealt with enterprise and the capacity to grow our enterprise and our economy in future.  That is all set out in the plan.  I have already touched on matters of culture, heritage and sport.<\/p> <p>  On the face of it, it is a good plan.  It is a brave political establishment or grouping that would set out and commit to these objectives.  The main question now is how the plan matches funding in future in terms of how we roll out the capital funding for the plan.  Another aspect is how we co-ordinate the plan with all 31 local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cussen touched on this point.  We have 31 local authorities.  How do we ensure coherent translation of the plan into policy?  The Department officials will be aware that we have city and county development plans throughout the 31 local authorities.  They are all running on different timelines in all 31 local authorities.  How will the Department set out how these can be dovetailed?  There will have to be changes in county development plans and structures following these plans.  I am keen to know the views on that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cussen said that, subsequent to publication on 16 February last by the Government, the Department has written to local authorities, regional assemblies and An Bord Plean&aacute;la notifying them that the national planning framework constitutes national planning policy in accordance with section 2 of the Planning and Development Act.  The policy has not yet been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann or the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is simply a point I want to make.  I am not entering into that debate, but there was an expectation that the national planning framework would be adopted by both Houses and that has not happened.  Anyway, the Department officials are telling us now that they have written to the relevant people notifying them that the framework is now the policy.  This is something Department officials might bear in mind.  There was an expectation that the Houses of the Oireachtas would approve the framework, yet all 31 local authorities have been told this is the policy.  I recommend that the Department official bear that in mind.<\/p> <p>  I am keen for the Department to take the lead in promoting, educating and supporting officials in local authorities in planning.  The Department should do likewise for the elected members.  There are approximately 990 councillors in the country.  They need to be empowered and enthused about how this plan will be rolled out in their areas.  They are stakeholders.  We are all stakeholders in this plan.  I call on the officials to go back and consider working through the Association of Irish Local Government or the Local Authority Members Association as well as regional meetings within local authorities to determine how the Department can assist them to understand and support the plan.  Everyone is a partner in this process.<\/p> <p>  I am supportive.  It is a good plan and in the absence of any other plan we should proceed with this one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#C00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521711000,"counter":1956,"content":"<p>We are happy to take several contributions together.

I am not going to get into the legal decision.  I fully understand that the final plan is a decision by the Government and I accept that.  However, it is clear from the interactions in the D&aacute;il Chamber that it is rather different.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister indicated a view on three different occasions.  The Taoiseach said that this was brought to the House.  There was a vote on the draft.  The vote took place in November of last year.  Clearly, that did not happen.  The Taoiseach then went on to say that if there was no vote it was because no one opposed something.  That is incorrect.  The T&aacute;naiste came in the day after and made a statement about public consultation.  We all agree with that.  That did happen.  He said that the debate on the national planning framework ran out of speakers.  In fact, we did not run out of speakers.  It is still on the Order of Business to return to statements on the national planning framework.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, then came in and clearly said there was a vote on the matter.<\/p> <p>  In fairness to the committee, which has worked on this matter, we need to set the record straight.  I have no problem in saying that the final plan is a Government decision and we do not have a say in that.  However, it is incorrect for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, to say he acted in the spirit of the legislation.  What the Taoiseach said is incorrect and what the T&aacute;naiste said is incorrect.  I think we need clarification from them on the matter.<\/p> <p>  I will move forward.  I wish to make some quick observations in respect of the process.  I come from a councillor background and I have gone through three county development plans.  Under the process we looked at the draft plan, then made variations to the draft plan and put it back on public display.  This is where the national planning framework falls down.  I acknowledge the vast amount of work that Department officials had to do in a short period.  However, in not putting the amendments of the national planning framework back out for consultation we could have unintended consequences.  This is because we have not dug down to analyse exactly the intention of some of the policies, some of which have now been adopted and in legislation.<\/p> <p>  Another weakness is that we cannot vary the national planning framework.  We have a review in six years time but we cannot vary it in the meantime.  If something is clearly not working, there is no legal mechanism in the process to vary that aspect or policy.  Perhaps it is something we could address in future.<\/p> <p>  Let us get more into the technical part of it.  The major question relating to my area is population.  I acknowledge that there has been movement from the draft plan to the adopted plan and the Department has taken out the caps on towns and villages with regard to how much they can grow.  Have we not simply, in one sense, kicked the can down the road?  Who will dictate population growth?  Where will it be?  Will the regional plan dictate where population growth is going?<\/p><p>In the county development plan for Wicklow which was adopted last year potential population growth is much higher than what we can achieve under the national planning framework.  We have to return to the core strategy and ask if the current plan can be continued with for six years if a fundamental aspect - potential population growth - is incorrect.  What will happen in that process?<\/p><p> I will speak briefly about the issue of rural housing.  I acknowledge and welcome the inclusion of the social clause, about which I spoke to Mr. Cussen.  However, the only time in the planning process when a decision that affects an individual is dealt with via a local authority is when one is dealing with a one-off rural house.  Normally the local authority deals with large-scale developments or applications involving multiple houses.  This is the only time when there is personal interaction with the local authority.  How am I supposed to explain the housing need and demand assessment to people who are applying for permission to build a rural house?  If one qualifies via  social or economic need, that should be enough.  There is no need to distinguish between urban and non-urban shadow.  If one qualifies to build a rural house by having a social and economic need, that should be enough.  When we talk about rural areas, we are looking at areas with a population of under 1,500.  There might be unintended consequences where we might actually have opened up the potential to have one-off rural houses on a wider scale than what would have applied under our county development plan.  <\/p><p> As a commuter county that is coming under huge pressure, the national development plan is a total disaster from a transport point of view.  After this meeting I will discuss with Mr. Cussen a recent communication with Transport Infrastructure Ireland and Wicklow County Council.  Who is driving the bus?  Anyone reading this will be shocked.  It will have huge consequences in terms of potential population growth.  I thought that we had addressed the TII issue and that it had to acknowledge the spatial strategy, regional and county plans, but it is clear that it is driving the bus in this endeavour and that County Wicklow can go hump it.  It got nothing in the national development plan, apart from the promise of a Luas connection in 2027.  We have a DART connection.  The only thing the national development plan promised for County Wicklow was maintaining existing services.  There is no vision of including Arklow and Wicklow in the rail network.  It is only at a figure of 30% capacity between Arklow and Greystones.  There is capacity to add more services, but the plan does not provide for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#C00700","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1962,"content":"<p>I welcome the departmental officials and thank the joint committee for taking on board my recommendation that Drogheda be added to the national development plan.  It would not have happened without the support of people like Senator Victor Boyhan.  I also compliment the officials for listening to me.  As they know, I do not always agree with them and <i>vice versa<\/i>, but in this case they have got it right, certainly as far as my community in Drogheda is concerned.  It was not mentioned in the original plan and there was a huge public outcry locally about it.  Perhaps the delegates might tell us how many representations or individual submissions were received from Drogheda.  Local people, including those involved in the Drogheda City Status Group, recommended that others make their voices heard and that is what happened.  Drogheda is now mentioned 11 times in the plan.  The planning is correct, unlike what has happened in other areas.  Planning and developing large centres of population and employment creation along the economic corridor, including, in particular, in Drogheda and Dundalk, are hugely important factors for my community.  They are the two biggest towns in the country - Drogheda being the biggest - and now at the centre of the national development plan, whereas they were not included heretofore.  The regional assemblies should decide what will happens in them to achieve growth and it should be based on what is contained in this framework.  The regional assemblies cannot change it and must work to it.  It is important that towns such as Drogheda and Dundalk be clearly earmarked for development, which process will take place through the framework.  <\/p><p>I note from the comments of the delegates that the planning Bill which is going through the Seanad will be amended to include recognition of the plan.  Will that apply to bodies such as TII, as Deputy Pat Casey mentioned?  Will it apply to bodies such as Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland?  Drogheda is now a growth centre for employment, whereas previously it was not.  It is hugely important that the statutory or semi-state bodies dovetail their thinking on exactly what Deputy Pat Casey said.  There is no point in having a plan if TII is not cognisant of it.  <\/p><p>At the same time a capital investment plan was published which was separate from the national development plan.  The key to it for Drogheda is the fact that the DART service is to be extended to the town and that the process will literally be fast-tracked with the hybrid diesel-electric trains to be used once they are delivered and electrification will then follow.  That is hugely important.  Capacity from Drogheda by rail is approximately 1,200 to 1,300 passengers per day, but each DART train will have the potential to carry over 1,000 passengers.  The potential for growth is huge and absolute and clearly recognised in the plans published.  As chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, I offer to meet the Chairman of this committee and Deputy Pat Casey to discuss these issues.  Deputies would be welcome at such a meeting, as would anyone who wanted to come along, to ensure transport planning kept pace with population growth.  If it does not, we will have more frustrated people in motor cars travelling longer journeys.  That is why the plan has to work.<\/p><p>This is a new dawn for Drogheda and County Louth.  The cross-Border commitment contained within the plan will be hugely beneficial for our communities.  Just over 2 million people live on this corridor and it is important that their potential be recognised.  I appreciate that this is not the responsibility of the officials present, but the question arises of local government reform and recognising the change in urban population growth which will be very significant.  The designation of Drogheda as a large centre of population means that we will have to change the position on local government as there is no council in place.  The corporation was abolished.  I know that it was done by the Government party of which I am a member after the disastrous Fianna F&aacute;il-jled Governments which destroyed the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#D00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1521711000,"counter":1963,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1964,"content":"<p>I had to get that in and was just checking that members are wewake.

I am still of the view that the plan is deficient, and my questions raise four key strategic concerns about it.  I endorse everything Deputy Casey said in terms of the politicking around the vote.  Mr. Cussen should be aware that the battle over securing an Oireachtas vote on that is not over.  He will be hearing from us soon on the back of the legal opinion the committee got yesterday because many of us are still of the view, notwithstanding that it is a matter for the Minister and not for the witnesses, that given the importance of this plan there must be an Oireachtas vote on it, and we will be pursuing that via the Seanad and when the Planning and Development Bill comes back to the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p> My questions relate to four issues.  When the plan was announced, the Minister promised that 75% of the population growth would be outside Dublin and 50% of the population growth would be outside the five major cities, but what many of us raised throughout the consultation process is that more than half the population growth, from objective 1b in the document - between 490,000 and 540,000 additional people - will be in the Dublin eastern midlands region.  The question is how we prevent that dramatic population growth from being concentrated in Dublin and the commuter belt and affecting all the commuter belt area.  It is all very well to say it is meant to be for a larger area and that we want a significant portion of that to repopulate the urban core of Dublin city, which I support, but the fear is that if the plan at the macro level and the capital programme alongside it do not get a number of issues right, we will have an over-concentration on Dublin, particularly the western suburbs and the commuter belt counties around it.  That is a real concern, and I have yet to hear anybody explain to me how that is to be avoided.  That is my first question.<\/p><p> The second question is related to that, which is that in the context of that growth, and even if that growth happens in an appropriately planned way, I am very concerned about the weakness of the public transport elements of the plan.  To give Mr. Cussen an example, as he is aware, in my constituency of Dublin Mid-West we have the Clonburris strategic development zone, a hugely important master plan for up to 8,000 social and affordable houses to be delivered over a ten-year period.  We are expecting that plan to be finalised via An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the end of this year.  If we look at the public infrastructure element of the framework and the capital plan, the major public infrastructure pieces for that part of the city will not be delivered until after those 8,000 houses have been delivered.  For example, in terms of the Lucan Luas, the metro and some of the bus connectivity projects, we are looking at those coming at the very end of the capital plan, and possibly beyond.  I raise that issue because it is just one example, and Deputy Casey mentioned another in terms of his constituency, where it seems the public transport infrastructure and the investment associated with it is coming significantly later on in the plan.  That is a real concern in terms of how we manage that proper integration of population growth, increased housing supply and adequate public transport.<\/p><p> The third question is about one of the areas in the plan with which I am most disappointed, and I have raised it from our very first meeting.  There is a spatial dimension to socio-economic disadvantage.  We know that from the census figures.  I asked at the outset that just as we have maps for population growth, ageing and employment clusters, we map socio-economic disadvantage.  I was told at an earlier meeting that we did not want to do that because we did not want to offend the people who might live in those communities.  I represent an area that has very substantial clusters of socio-economic disadvantage and those people would be much more concerned if they were ignored, and in this plan they are ignored in the sense that they are not visible.  That is significant, but if someone is making plans, for example, in terms of the location of infrastructure or the jobs targets, if we are not ensuring that, along with population growth, increased investment and job growth, some of that is targeting those areas where there are higher concentrations of socio-economic disadvantage, it will simply repeat the patterns of disadvantage.<\/p><p> If we take the jobs targets, for example, we have a jobs target in 1c for an additional 225,000 people in employment in the south region but, as we know, the south east has a disproportionate concentration of deprivation and unemployment.  This is not just a matter for the regional and local authority plans.  It is a strategic matter at the top level. How will the Department deal with that?<\/p><p> In terms of my final question, while I acknowledge there are some improvements in terms of the all-Ireland and north west dimension, I still believe it is weak.  We talk about the north of our country in a section entitled, Working with Our Neighbours, which is also to do with the European Union, although peripherally.  How much contact in the latter phases of the development of the plan did the Department have with civil servants and counterparts in the North?  What practical and detailed reassurance can Mr. Cussen give the committee in terms of the level of all-Ireland integration of this plan and the benefits that will be accrued from taking a proper all-Ireland approach because at a strategic level, that is very valuable?<\/p><p> Chairman, I have to leave at 10.30 a.m. as I have another engagement but I will get the answers from the blacks afterwards.  I apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#D00700","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1969,"content":"<p>I want to raise a number of points.  The committee would welcome the engagement with Deputy O'Dowd's transport committee.  I know I am biased as Chairman but I believe we are a proactive, determined committee.  Whether it is to do with Rebuilding Ireland, the national planning framework, NPF, or any of the Bills that come before us, we are a dedicated committee that works very well with the Department.  We do not always see eye to eye but we always come to a solution, which is very beneficial.<\/p><p>We are a committee with vast experience.  Many of us are former members of local authorities or have been in government for a long time so we have dealt with many local area plans and development plans.  Some of us have dealt with strategic development zones.  I respect and understand the principles around proper sustainable planning and not <i>ad hoc<\/i>planning that resulted in ghost estates, dispersed communities and all that goes with that.<\/p><p>One of the key elements that struck me at a very early stage of this process was the figure of 10,000 people commuting from Portlaoise to Dublin for work almost ever day.  For me, that was to do with a quality of life issue.  If most people were spending their time commuting to work in their cars - an hour to go to work and an hour to come home - with all the pressures that go with that in terms of child care and stress, their quality of life is diminished.  All of that is underpinned by past irregular planning decisions.<\/p><p>The national planning framework outlines an environment that allows us create the kind of society we want, whether that is in terms of employment, community, recreation or residential living.  It has been captured well in terms of the next 22 years.  I have not seen anything like it in my 17 years in politics, which I know is not as long a period as that of other members. <\/p><p>I very much welcome the ongoing engagement we had with the Department and the various sectors.  I attended many of the public information events and the engagement throughout the country was tremendous, and it did not drop. <\/p><p>I disagree on a number of issues Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised, especially in regard to Clonburris.  I can speak, as can Senator Boyhan, about the Cherrywood strategic development zone, SDZ, where we had a Luas passing through fields with no houses around them for a number of years and stations that did not need to be used because we did not have the population.  However, as local and national politicians, we set the parameters and infrastructure requirements that have to be adhered to in those SDZs.  That responsibility is given to the local authorities and their local representatives for them to vote and decide on the staged mechanism of those SDZs.<\/p><p>I disagree also with what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said about social deprivation, the population and the disparities around that.  Education underpins growth, and when we see that 50 large-scale school projects are planned throughout the country, that equates to approximately 1,500 places.  That is proper planning.  Early stage proper planning and early intervention creates the environment in which people can grow, stay in their areas and be part of their communities.<\/p><p>I welcome the intense emphasis on encouraging foreign direct investment throughout the country and not being Dublin-centric or Leinster-centric.<\/p><p>We are not trying to discourage people from coming to Dublin and Leinster but are trying to disperse them in a proper and sustainable manner.  I know there are issues around transport and I agree with Deputy Casey on that point.  These are issues around which we need to keep applying pressure, both at national and local levels, to ensure transport is provided in a proper manner.<\/p><p> I very much welcome the protection of the Wild Atlantic Way, which is a very precious resource, and the development that is foreseen around it.  I very much welcome the attention to our tier 1 and tier 2 ports and the harnessing of growth and of renewable energy in many ports, particularly in the west, and the fact that the west will provide most of the supply for the east in the future.  <\/p><p> I recognise that these are targets and strategies that we have to implement, and it will be difficult to implement them.  We are moving to that framework now.  As public representatives, whether local, national or European Parliament levels, we have a role to make sure this happens because it will benefit all of us.  We must not be parochial.  We must look further than our own areas and our own back gardens.<\/p><p> I very much welcome metro north and the connection to the Luas, which is long overdue.  Senator Boyhan recalls the smarter travel bids in Sandyford business district, which were very good initiatives to connect our transport hubs, and different transport methods, whether bus, Luas, walking and cycling, such as the bike schemes in Dublin that are being rolled out in other areas.  That makes areas attractive for employment and residential development.  Nothing in life is ever perfect but this is a substantial plan that lays a very strong foundation to develop the country in the way we want it to develop and that the people who participated in recent years want it to develop.<\/p><p> I did not want to mention the legal advice we got yesterday but my interpretation of it is very different from Deputy &Oacute; Broin's.  I suppose legal advice is open to interpretation but I was very clear the whole way through this process.  I reaffirm, as the members have, the continuing engagement of the committee on the national planning framework.  I also acknowledge the tremendous work that has gone into making it happen and getting it into print, the dedication and hours put into the plan.  Sometimes the authors of these plans are unsung heroes and do not get the recognition they deserve.  It took tremendous commitment by them, the Department and the many stakeholders to bring it to this point.  Now we have to move to its implementation and the onus is on all of us to make sure it happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#E00200","speaker":"1246","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1521711000,"counter":1971,"content":"<p>Deputy  Pat Casey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521711000,"counter":1972,"content":"<p>The committee has yet again demonstrated its expertise and knowledge because its members have extensive experience in planning and development matters in their areas, working with the legislation and policy.  They have always demonstrated a deep understanding of this.  The central message in our initial presentation was to get across the sense that we are embarking on an implementation process.  It is very important to have regular interaction with the committee, to come back and test out our approaches to implementation with it and seek out its views and guidance on priorities, etc.  This is a whole-of-Government initiative and it is one the committee members support directly or indirectly because of the importance of having a strategic plan after the difficult years we have come through.  It can always be enhanced, or particular aspects of its implementation can be brought out.  It is important to have an agile and a responsive implementation process.  This is a very important document but it is only a framework and requires further fleshing out.  We are alive to all the issues the committee has raised and need to have continual engagement with the committee on how to grapple with those issues and so on because there is a lot of work to be done. <\/p> <p>  I will quickly run through some of the contributions made and make one or two comments in response.  I will then call on my colleagues to deal with a number of aspects raised.  I am happy for the dialogue to continue for as long as the committee wishes.  <\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Boyhan's comments, there is obviously a different forum for that whole D&aacute;il approval piece and the legal advice, to which Deputy &Oacute; Broin alluded.  One of the things of which we must be conscious is the fact that to ensure there was a planning framework for capital investment, we had to push on with it.  We engaged in as much consultation as we could and reached out far and wide across the country on its development.  We need to be conscious that the practicalities and fairness have a retrospective approval process, having listened to, and taken on board, all the views heretofore.<\/p> <p>  To reassure Senator Boyhan on his key point about capacity-building, I was with the regional assembly in Wexford a couple of weeks ago and spent a long day and evening explaining the plan in detail.  We will be at the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, Conference in Donegal after Easter and we will go wherever we are invited to build that capacity, awareness and understanding of the evolution and implementation of the framework.<\/p> <p>  The regional spatial economic strategies will be the cockpit for how the more technical aspects of the framework will be worked out.  It would be very wrong of us to hand down a tablet of stone from the top, setting out detailed population targets and so on for a 20 year plus framework.  That would be a very unwieldy and rigid system.  Much more appropriately the regional assemblies have the scope to work with us around a table and go through those technical aspects.<\/p> <p>  The planning framework is a place-making strategy.  Population targets and figures are important metrics in setting the background to the planning but place making involves much more than numbers and spreadsheets and setting population targets.  Far too often in the past we have embarked on local planning processes that may have set very ambitious growth targets and in many cases, particularly in towns in the commuter belt, we have achieved or exceeded those targets but we know there are many problems on the ground in the way of the adequacy of public services, the fact people do not live and work in the same place and all the pressures that committee members have mentioned in respect of long-distance commuting and so on.  Place making and population targets are not necessarily the same thing.  It is very important to get the thinking joined up on that.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by Deputy &Oacute; Broin&rsquo;s and Deputy Casey's contributions.  I am sure our colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the transport agencies would support us in saying that there might be a merit in having a joint session on planning and transport integration.<\/p><p>It is important that those elements are in synch and that we use the assets we have to the best of our ability and to the maximum extent possible.<\/p><p> On Clonburris, I might digress but it is related to the point Deputy Casey raised.  Previous Governments made the investments etc.  We have the good fortune of having invested in upgrades of our mainline rail network.  We have a physical infrastructure, as the Deputy alluded to, that is capable of being sweated more.  That is happening in Clonburris.  While the DART project and the upgrades necessary to deliver that in its full glory will necessarily take some years to put in place because of the engineering and all of that, we have seen signs of good innovative thinking from the transport agencies and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Ordering a fleet of hybrid trains offers a much better operational approach.  They can integrate seamlessly with the DART because they can go from diesel power to electric power, obviating the need for people to change trains in places such as Bray.<\/p><p> As members of the committee will know there is an ongoing upgrade which is progressing very well providing more rail services from the west of the city into Connolly Station using the Phoenix Park tunnel and the northern suburban rail line.  From talking to my colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, I know that is an area that once fleet enhancements and other bits and pieces are put in place, they have significant plans to augment that.  It is incorrect to suggest that the progression of a strategic development zone such as Clonburris would have to await the full deployment of the DART upgrade.  Many things are being done in the interim.<\/p><p> Deputy Casey asked about the capacity of infrastructure and whether we are aligning that infrastructure correctly with focused, prioritised, proper plan-led development in Wicklow or wherever it is in the greater Dublin area.  There may be merit in having a joint session involving our colleagues from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is always good to get transport planners, spatial planners, and decision and policy makers such as members of the committee together in the one room.  It is very important to have a joined-up approach.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Dowd asked about Drogheda.  My comments on the regional strategy teasing that out in more detail, address that as part of the regional, spatial and economic strategy process.  IDA Ireland and the development agencies have bought into that process and are obliged to follow that process through with their own strategies and so on.  Ms Walsh will give more detail on the public consultation process and the metrics regarding the east, the Dublin to Belfast corridor, Drogheda and so on.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised some concerns about the Dublin population increase landing maybe in the western suburbs and outlying commuter areas.  Mr. Hogan might deal with this in more detail.  The planning framework is very ambitious for actually landing considerably more of that within the city core, within the canal ring and within the existing built-up area.  That speaks to our plans for the regeneration agency and getting a better bang for the State's buck out of the publicly owned lands we already have, particularly across the broader State-owned enterprise landscape etc.<\/p><p> I understand the Deputy's concerns.  That was motivating us in the first place to have an ambitious strategy for urban consolidation, compact urban growth and so on.  It would not be a good outcome for the planning framework if the growth of Dublin were to effectively land to the west or pushing out into the outlying areas.<\/p><p> I spoke about the public transport issue.  Mr. Hogan will deal with the question about spatial dimension to social disadvantage, where it is to be addressed and so on.  Mr. Hogan and Ms Walsh might also deal with the all-island dimension and our engagement with our colleagues in the Northern system and where that is going.<\/p><p> I hope that is a reasonably comprehensive overview.  Deputy Casey also asked about HDNA and rural and so forth.  I ask Mr. Hogan to pick up on some of those points.  That was just a sweep through and I might have missed a good few things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521711000,"counter":1974,"content":"<p>I will pick up on some of the things Mr. Cussen mentioned.  The national planning framework is just the first stage.  In looking towards implementation, we have characterised it now as being the end of the beginning, as it were.  We are now trying to put in place a roadmap on how this will be implemented.  As it stands, we only have the national tier piece of the jigsaw in place.  We have to work through with the regions, local authorities and the local government sector as the next stage.  That will not happen overnight; it will take the rest of this year into early next year for the regional strategies to be put in place.  Thereafter the county plans will have to reflect that and will have to be varied, which will take into 2020.  Realistically those plans will last for six years, as they do, up to 2026.<\/p> <p>  The first stage is the first ten years which will coincide with the national development plan and will be measurable in 2026 with the outcome from the census at that stage.  We are talking about the first ten years in terms of implementation.  We need to issue guidance now.  We have met the planning teams from all 30 local authorities at this stage.  We prioritised that because we wanted to engage at the local government level.  They are key stakeholders for us.  We have listened to what people have had to say, their concerns, their questions and what they need to know more about.  We have committed to issuing a roadmap with further guidance on the RSES procedure in particular by late April or early May.  Some questions arose.  How will population be addressed?  What should the MAPs, metropolitan area plans, cover?  They form a new element of planning.  We see them as a co-ordination piece where there are a number of local authorities, particularly in the cities.<\/p> <p>  In addition there is the question about bringing plans into synch.  The legislation before the Seanad at the moment, if enacted, will ensure that no development plans will commence for a period until such time as the regional plans are in place next year.  That will enable a better synchronisation of the county plans with the regional ones and everybody to be working off broadly the same set of objectives, which is what we have started to put in place at a national level.  This is a kind of work in progress as members will know.<\/p> <p>  The current regional and county plans are based on figures derived from the 2006 census.  There are an additional 300,000 people in the country now.  We are out of synch in numbers as it stands.  We have started to update and rectify that situation.  We have to work through that.  It cannot change overnight.  It will take ten years to roll through.  As I said, this is long-term planning.  We are not seeking to restrict numbers.  We are reluctant to issue what we see as an updated set of figures that risk becoming out of date very quickly.  We need to look at it more creatively in terms of a range, a relationship to the national average or something like that.  We are giving detailed consideration to that at the moment.  This issue has been raised by many local authorities in our meetings in recent days.<\/p> <p>  There obviously has to be some balance as well.  I will shortly come to the targets we have set for urban growth and why they are important.  As well as the cities, there is also huge concern over how large towns, smaller towns and villages across the country are developing, particularly further west.  Of course rural housing continues to form an element of Irish housing provision.  All that needs to be balanced up.  One of the problems we have had throughout the process is that people perceive there to be unlimited demand for everything and that somehow we can address every issue, city growth, strong towns, strong villages and unlimited one-off housing.<\/p><p>We do not have the levels of growth, however, to sustain the aspirations across the board for city growth, strong towns, strong rural towns and unlimited one-off housing.  Balance and prioritisation are required.  We are trying to enable decisions to be made for the bigger places at national and regional levels and to enable a sufficient degree of choice for local elected members at county level.  We do not want to restrict things or to give a set of numbers that cannot be changed as we are all too aware of the possible intended consequences of doing so.  In Wicklow in 2016, there were 22,000 fewer people than planned for, because the figures in the 2006 census had become so outdated.  It is a consequence of the downturn and we need to update it.  We accept that there was a need to bring rural housing policy in line with what currently exists and we have done that.  The distinction between rural and urban reflects the current guidance, which was put in place in 2006 or 2007.  The closer one gets to larger urban centres the more limited the demand if one qualifies, and qualification thresholds are difficult to police on the fringes of an urban area.<\/p><p> In transport infrastructure implementation, we are working to buy into, embed and mainstream the strategy across Departments and agencies.  We started with the local authority sector and we will continue to do that with agencies such as TII, the NTA, the IDA and Irish Water, all of which are critical stakeholders and are very keen that we have a strategy to which everyone can sign up and work towards.  There is good rail infrastructure in Wicklow and good potential on foot of that.<\/p><p> There was a question on the town plan for Drogheda.  Many of the same principles of our co-ordination plans will apply to towns as well as cities, particularly the five towns mentioned, as they are equally applicable to large towns throughout the country.  There is a whole-town plan, as opposed to a local area plan, to address land and development and while there are in a couple of cases, particularly Athlone and Drogheda, issues relating to governance of the planned process, this is simply because they straddle more than one jurisdiction.  We are working closely with our local government colleagues on those issues but we have enshrined the principle of a whole-town plan in our framework.  The decision on how it is governed is a matter that can be dealt with separately.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked how we would achieve the targets, which is a key question and one with which we have grappled throughout the process.  As Mr. Cussen said, we do not have a warehouse full of people whom we can send to different parts of the country.  People are attracted primarily to where there are jobs and where there is good infrastructure and a good quality of life.  We are trying to encourage employment growth through foreign direct investment, local enterprise and focusing on places that have scale and have good third level institutions.  They need to be networked, by which I mean have a relationship to adjoining places, such as Athlone working with surrounding towns in the midlands of Tullamore, Mullingar, Longford, Ballinasloe, etc.  Athlone is the centre of a transport network, has a third level institution and is well positioned in relation to the other towns.  There is potential for all the towns to work together in a collaborative way.  Collaboration is a really important criterion when making bids for regeneration funded by the urban and rural generation fund.  It is about scale and agglomeration and it is about third level institutions ensuring their graduates stay in the region.  The research paper which supports the document confirms all of this and it is why there is a focus on the cities and on a relatively small number of regional centres.<\/p><p> I was asked about Clonburris and the question of infrastructure following development.  This is an age-old question in planning and we are moving towards it slowly, getting it right in some instances.  I wrote the plan for Adamstown 16 years ago and we introduced the concept of phasing infrastructure with development.  It was hugely controversial at the time and there was a fear that we would encourage 20,000 people to come over ten or 15 years, with up to 10,000 houses needing to be built.  It has not worked out like that and has been much slower but all the infrastructure is in place.  The same railway line runs through Clonburris, and there are railway stations that are disused at the moment.  The plan indicates everything that will happen over a long period of time but the roll-out of development is invariably much slower, which enables the infrastructure to follow with good policies.  We are doing everything to make sure that alignment happens.<\/p><p> The spatial dimension of social disadvantage has been raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin on previous occasions and we have looked at it in detail.  It is a very interesting analysis and the Pobal document is published every year.  At national level, the difficulty is that a small number of counties, namely, Dublin, Cork, Galway, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, are marginally above average and the rest of the country is marginally below average.  It is only when one drills down to a local level that the pattern emerges but we are not operating at that level of detail.  Approximately 70% of the country is marginally above or marginally below the average so there is no particular pattern of disadvantage or advantage.  Another 15% is advantaged to some extent - the word used for this is \"affluent\" - and a further 15% is disadvantaged to varying extents, though this is improving.  This 15% is geographically scattered and is best dealt with a local level, at county level or the level of a local area or town plan.  We would be willing to indicate that this be taken into account in town plans and housing assessments but it is not appropriate to the level at which we operate.  We have addressed the issue on a broader front, such as education, access to employment, to services and to transport.<\/p><p> I have covered the main points.  As we are developing the implementation strategy, we will be open to suggestions and input on how we can further advise agencies, Departments and the local government sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1976,"content":"<p>Along with other members, I welcome the assistance officials have given to this committee and the Houses in the course of this process.<\/p><p>The national spatial strategy was scrapped in 2012 by the previous Government and not replaced.

That is the prerogative and the right of the Government and we respect and acknowledge that.  It chose to refer to previous legislation which gives it the right to place the framework on a statutory basis.  If it practised as it preached, it would have honoured the initial commitment it gave but it is obvious that, by virtue of the numbers within the Houses, it thought it might not receive the support to progress the Bill with the inclusive potential it had.<\/p> <p>  As regards county development plans, I seek clarification as to whether the previous legislation that governs the publication and statutory basis that this framework now has gives and guarantees the hierarchy as running from the national planning framework plan to regional plans, county development plans and area plans.  If that is so, must any future plans merely have regard to that or must they strictly abide by that hierarchy?  Local councillors must have some autonomy in terms of their efforts to devise, prepare and agree county development plans.  I wish to put on the record of the committee and make the point to the Department and the Minister who has or will have responsibility in this area that the help and assistance afforded to members of local authorities in preparing a development plan leaves much to be desired.  I say that having had 19 years' experience as local authority member.  Many other committee members have similar experience.  There must be provision for local authorities to have relevant professional expertise at their disposal and to act on their behalf rather than being led and directed by the executive.  Local authority members come from a certain viewpoint and should have the relevant professional expertise available to them in providing a draft plan which is then the subject of discussion and amendment by local authority members and the public thereafter.  Local authority members do not have the time or expertise they desire to adequately deal with development plans.   That will have been copper-fastened if greater pressure is now placed on them by virtue of this hierarchy.<\/p> <p>  As regards the issues raised by Deputy Casey regarding rural housing, the initial draft only provided for an economic need criteria to be considered in the event of a person wishing to provide a rural house.  I am glad to see that there is now also consideration of social need.  How that is interpreted may vary depending on the local authority area.  In my county, our main water source is underground and one must be conscious of the proliferation of septic tanks, which is not the case in other counties.  Aside from that, our interpretation and best practice, of which Ms Walsh will be well aware as she has been there, is that one must cater for local need.  One must cater for landowners and their families and for people who have an attachment to an area and wish to ensure they have a prospect of living there.  If we are serious about rural communities thriving or surviving into the future, people must be allowed to live in them.<\/p> <p>  There is a definite focus in the strategy on moving people towards urban areas.  I recognise and acknowledge that and appreciate that cities must grow but, in terms of the regions, I fear that the statistics, information and data collated in regard to the midlands region have been considered alongside those for the east of the country.  The midlands is an identifiable region in its own right, comprising counties Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath.  The statistics published by the ESRI earlier this year are vastly different from those published that fed into this plan.<\/p> <p>  I am thankful the Government chose the path it did in regard to the legislation it chose to put this on a statutory basis because Governments and government policy can change.  If I had my way, I would seek electoral approval to amend elements of the plan, as is my right, and would thereafter accept the will of the people, whether that indicates support for me or others who campaign on those issues.<\/p> <p>  The Government must acknowledge that local authority members should have independent relevant professional expertise available to them in playing their part in seeking to provide for future county development plans.  That has not previously been the case and there is a huge weight of expectation which councillors are not able to live up to, based on what they are paid and the time available to them to do it.  Only when the Government recognises and acknowledges that will local and county development plans be representative and what they should be.  It is the councillors who are accountable.  With all due respect, the witnesses have been in their jobs for far longer than most local authority members but the councillors put themselves forward, are accountable to the people and seek to devise and prepare a plan that meets the expectations of those who give them the privilege of being public representatives.  A process in terms of regional plans has now begun, a planning framework having been put in place that was missing for the past six years.  I was surprised that that process commenced before the planning framework was agreed and that gave me the impression that the Government had the planning framework in its back pocket anyway.  County development plans and area plans will follow but they will not be what they ought if the relevant expertise is not available to local authority members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#J00500","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1982,"content":"<p>I echo and support Deputy Cowen, who makes a very valid point on training and ongoing professional support, as earlier discussed.  I come from and was a member of D&uacute;n Laoghaire local authority.  Judicial reviews have been carried out in respect of planning issues and county development plans in that area.  The issue in terms of councillors is ongoing and we must empower them, which will give them skills, knowledge and responsibilities.  There must be independent support.  I know of councillors who themselves sought and paid for legal advice as citizens of communities that feel so vexed by some things planning authorities try to do.  That is the reality of it.  Although it is not a matter for today's meeting, I know many councillors who put their hands in their pockets to write submissions in regard to planning for the communities they represent.  All present know of such councillors.  I have had to spend my own money to appeal decisions by a local authority in which I lived and for which I was an elected member.  I had to pay the local authority to which I had been elected to exercise my functions in respect of planning.<\/p><p>I was unhappy with the some of the decisions, appealed and was successful, but nobody validated them and came back and gave me my money.  That is replicated all over the country.  <\/p><p> My final question concerns State agencies and assets, with which the document is peppered.  We have very valuable real estate assets.  I am thinking, in particular, of the port and dockland areas in Drogheda, Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Wicklow, Waterford and Cork.  We can see that a lot happening is in Waterford.  Deputies from there have been upfront in announcing their input into and how they shaped it.  There are ports all the way around to Galway.  It is a vast amount of real estate with really good zoning, at which we need to look.  I am not being critical; I am just saying it is really important that we look at its value, assessment, zoning and potential.  We have regional assemblies, local authorities and State agencies.  When and where can we get an inventory of the State's assets which are public lands?  I understand the Department deals with all of the local authorities.  I brought to its attention where there were deficiencies and returns were not fully accurate.  We have a problem in that regard.  The States has vast tracts of land which is very much part of what the Department is planning.  In fairness, it was referenced in the presentation.  Will the delegates tell us how it is going to happen, who is going to do it and what the lead agency is?  I know that marine and coastal planning is a separate strand, but will the delgates tell us how it is progressing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#J00600","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1984,"content":"<p>In reply to my good friend and colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, the national spatial strategy should have been revised once its cycle came to an end, as he rightly noted.  It was a disastrous strategy because very few of the designated areas actually became growth areas.  Drogheda which had been omitted from it heretofore actually grew to become the biggest town in Ireland.  That is how wrong the strategy was and I was concerned when Drogheda was excluded initially.  Under the Freedom of Information Act, I discovered that a note on the national planning framework had gone to the Cabinet.  Therefore, the Government of the day which happened to be led by Fianna F&aacute;il decided at the time that Drogheda would be excluded and that Dundalk would be designated as the growth centre.  The Government has done the opposite.  It has included both towns because they are the biggest in Ireland and we need to recognise growth where it happens.  That is why this plan is so important.<\/p> <p>  The plan is also important in the control of development.  I agree that it should go to the regional bodies for their consideration and approval, but it is the plan and they must have due regard to it.  That is a key point because in the past whole areas were rezoned by councillors who then had to de-zone them because developments never took place.  One needs a structure and the freedom to make decisions within it, but one needs the proper structure.  One thing I recollect from my 29 years in local government is a development plan for a village in County Louth.  The council advised us that if we were producing a development plan for the village, sewerage capacity had been reached such that the village could not accommodate any more housing.  A private function was held to which people were invited.  It was run by the developer.  Needless to say, I was not invited because I would not have been in favour of what ultimately happened.  A huge area of land was rezoned which was unable to take the housing planned to be built on it.  That was what was wrong with local government planning.  <\/p> <p>  Another example involved something that is in the records of the Department of Housing, Planning and the Environment.  The county development plan for Louth was being drawn up, but as an elected member of the council, I had not seen it.  One day I received a telephone call in which I was asked to visit a certain businessman in the town.  I asked him what he wanted to see me about.  He took a copy of the draft development plan for County Louth out of his briefcase that included the areas to be designated and zoned for housing.  I was disgusted and asked the then Minister to investigate how this had happened.  I was told that because it was a draft development plan, it did not have any legal status, but that if I wished, I could go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and report the matter.  There has been a lot of hookery and crookery in planning in Ireland which is appalling and disgraceful.  The shame falls on politicians and those who made the decisions.  We must make sure planning is transparent and above board.  There has been tribunal after tribunal, but I hope and believe we now have a proper structure in place, notwithstanding the fact that there is freedom within it for local government to have plans.  <\/p> <p>  Another thing that disgusted me was the fact that during the so-called boom which was a big disaster builders were writing development plans for councils which did not have the money to fund them.  The comments made about councils not being funded to produce their own development plans are right.  Development plans for places in County Louth were written by the developers who built the damn houses.  This has to stop.  We must ensure there is proper and adequate funding to obtain independent professional advice for councillors to make plans.  One of the things that disgusted me the most was the fact that we had a development plan for Drogheda that designated an historic building, Drogheda grammar school, for conservation and preservation, but the building was very kindly demolished by a builder in the middle of the night over a holiday weekend.  When the council would not act, I did, with another person.  We went to the High Court and, through the planning process, had the building reconstructed with the same type of handmade brick with which it had originally been constructed.  What really sickened me was the effort of politicians - I obtained this information from the Department on foot of a request I had made - who requested that favoured designation be granted to the owners of the site who had illegally demolished an historic building to proceed with the development of the site.  All this must end, which is why I welcome the constructive engagement, not control, by the Department such that it is laid out what someone can and cannot do.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome what Mr. Hogan said about looking at towns such as Drogheda - he also mentioned Athlone - which are growing outside the traditional physical boundaries of counties.  If I heard him correctly, he said the adjoining local authorities would talk about what might happen.  I would have concerns about this.  I am talking about Drogheda, which is why I mentioned the point about local government reform.  If two county councils are to decide what the largest town in Ireland will look like in the future, they have a vested interest in terms of the income they will receive in rates on properties on the periphery of the town.  I see the Chairman is smiling.  Perhaps he knows what I am talking about.  It is hugely important where two towns are identified such as Drogheda and Athlone - there are other places also - that if changes are to be made, they be made independently of the councils which have a vested interest.  Commercial development on the outskirts of Drogheda in the area of County Meath has occurred in the face of opposition from the planners in County Meath.  It was forced on communities by councillors who had decided in the local development plan to designate areas which they had been advised should not be designated.  Therefore, there is a range of issues to be considered.  The Minister should set up a new council for the town of Drogheda to decide on what should happen.<\/p><p>He should not give control to decide the future of the area to two adjoining county councils for the reasons I have set out.  There is a campaign in Drogheda to secure city status, which is well known and has been publicised nationally.  I asked the Central Statistics Office when Drogheda, which has a population of 40,000, was projected to achieve a population of 50,000 and it stated that by 2030 approximately the population would be 52,000.  It is important to plan now for the city Drogheda will become.  I accept that it is not a city now, albeit the population surrounding the town exceeds that level.  However, it is not in one county, which is the issue.  There are extant planning permissions for the construction of approximately 7,500 homes in the area north of Drogheda.  Speaking to the Minister through the officials who are present, I note that for the Department's plan to work, it must plan now for Drogheda to become a city by putting in place immediately a local government structure with the equivalent of a city manager to take charge and control of these developments.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for his indulgence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#K00200","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521711000,"counter":1986,"content":"<p>I will pick up on the previous round of questions also and refocus on the alignment and sequencing we have been discussing in the past month through our engagement with local authorities and regional assemblies.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Cussen and Mr. Hogan have alluded to the fact that we are in a transition phase.  We have been communicating what we see as the next steps and the road map for implementation in working with the regional assemblies and local authorities.  Related to that and a matter which has been the focus of some comments today is the county development plan and its role.  What is to happen to it?  How is it to be aligned and what is the timeframe for it?  The Bill before the Seanad includes amendments to prepare and allow for a deferral of all development plans nationally.  The rationale for this is twofold.  It will allow for national policy to be decided, followed by regional policy and then local policy which can be worked through the county and city development plan approach and, equally, the local area plan approach.  This is a landscape on which the RSES has not yet been decided by each of the three regional assemblies.  They are involved in that process and that is the policy priority for the remainder of the year and into early 2019.  It would be inappropriate for local authorities to attempt to start to write or review a development plan without the regional signposting or policy being decided.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the hierarchy, what is being reinforced through the amendment of the Bill is that national policy will be decided ahead of regional and then county development plans.  There are timelines that allow for a concertina effect.  There will be a number of development plans which will have to initiate a plan review or pick it up after a pause and within a short timeframe after the RSES has been adopted.  That allows for a kick-start of the development plan system once regional policy has been decided.  Local authorities have been briefed on this issue, but the Bill has not yet been enacted and commenced.  Until it is, the current status of plans remains in force.  It is disruptive to the system in one sense, but the wider benefit in the longer term will ensure local authorities will not be without the guidance of national and regional policy in preparing their own plans.  The focus for the remainder of the year is on regional assemblies preparing the three RSES plans.  Local authorities are already involved in that process through the SPAs and technical working groups.  We are encouraging that process to continue.<\/p> <p>  Another large theme which has emerged through submissions and our engagement is single housing in the countryside.  It is important to speak about rural housing in a wider housing context.  The NPF has suggested to local authorities the preparation of a housing need demand assessment.  It is not designed to replace current housing strategies, but it is a composite methodology to allow a local authority as both the planning and housing authority to understand housing needs over the plan period and estimate and project what the tenure will be and for whom it will cater.  It could be for people over 65 years of age or an assessment of how much student accommodation is required.  It will be about how much affordable housing is required and what the private market has the potential to deliver.  Part of it will be about how rural housing fits into the overall picture and it will differ for every local authority.  To supplement it, the national planning framework does not amend rural housing policy, as it stands.  It acknowledges the different local authority policies in place, of which there are 29 to 30.  While all of them are based on the sustainable rural housing guidelines, their application has caused difficulties in some cases.  What we are saying is we need a composite picture of what is required and what the baseline is.  That goes back to what Mr. Hogan said about development plans working from out-of-date population projections.  We are trying to realign and re-establish the system in order that we will support both executives and elected members in decision-making based on up-to-date evidence - everything from census results to HNDA, allowing a more effective core strategy to come into force.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barry Cowen referred to the onerous nature of a development plan.  It is a two-year review process and there are allocated times for the public, the executive and members to deal with it.  It is certainly onerous.  While the professional expertise of a council is available to members and the executive is in place to advise, there are plenty of examples of where the executive has also needed professional assistance.  For example, there is the matter of a strategic environmental assessment where ecological expertise is required to enable an appropriate assessment to be made or where a strategic flood risk assessment is required.  That is all to the benefit of the wider plan and the members where the expertise is taken on board.  The advice is designed to be presented to the members.  It is absolutely acknowledged that the process is onerous and time consuming, in particular given the volume of documentation involved.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of other points on which to pick up.  On the all-island dimension and the engagement at the later stages of finalisation of the NPF, it was slightly more difficult when the political establishment was not in force to allow political engagement to happen.  However, we have involved our colleagues in the North of Ireland and engaged with them.  The chief planner in the North was invited and sat on the advisory group for the national planning framework.  There very much was a presence and engagement which we were conscious of securing.<\/p> <p>  In the case of Drogheda, there was a significant number of submissions received, albeit I do not have the figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Alma Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1987,"content":"<p>The Department could send it on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#L00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521711000,"counter":1988,"content":"<p>I can certainly furnish it to the committee.

Deputy Barry Cowen raised some very specific matters.  I note that the legislation refers to a broad level of consistency between the plans.  That provides for autonomy and the outworking of issues locally to be reconciled and worked with at regional and national level.  We are certainly not enthusiasts for a tablet of stone approach, nor does the legislation support such slavish adherence.  As Deputy Cowen knows from his area, issues need to be worked out at local level.  He raised some issues, of which we were very well aware, involving aquifers and groundwater sensitivity in County Offaly.<\/p><p>The legislation envisages that a broad level of strategic detail will be pinned down at national and regional levels but, necessarily, there will be a more detailed outworking of that at local level.  The legislation mentions the word consistency and not adherence or compliance.  Obviously the former is a lot stronger than the term \"have regard to\", which was the subject of previous criticism.  A previous Government introduced the changes to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 and the language was adjusted in light of court judgments from a previous time.   <\/p><p> Ms Walsh has dealt very well with the point made about the rural aspect.  We are not rewriting the rural housing policy in the context of a national planning framework.  Please bear in mind that the local authorities that deal with rural areas encounter various geographical, socio-economic and all sorts of physical aspects, as alluded to earlier.<\/p><p> I assume that the Deputy will agree with me, in the context of promoting a good degree of choice in rural areas, that Ireland has an immensely strong rural identity which is part and parcel of our culture and way of life.  It is important that we give rural towns and villages a fighting chance and provide a choice to people in terms of where they live, particularly when dealing with remote rural communities such as the villages located near the Slieve Bloom mountains in Offaly.  Also, some of the small villages located in the western part of the county have suffered for many years due to economic decline, etc.  The message put forward by the national planning framework and capital planning, as shown by our efforts to support local authorities in implementing same at a local level, is very much that those towns need a greater fighting chance when it comes to competing for the available level of interest from people who want to put down roots or set up businesses or whatever in those areas.  As the Deputy will be well aware, there are not enough sites available in some of those towns and there is a lack of water services and also derelict buildings.  The town of Banagher springs to mind.  The purpose of the rural regeneration and development fund is to tackle these issues.  It does not put towns and villages ahead of rural areas in terms of housing choice.  We want to provide a range of accommodation choices so that people can put a roof over their heads.  Too often, either because the site has been made freely available by a family member, which is much better than buying expensive zoned land in a small town or village, or the local authority cannot provide enough serviced sites, smaller towns and villages never get a look in and they often become the locations where social housing is provided but not private housing.  People make an economic decision based on a sensible decision-making approach. <\/p><p> In terms of the national planning framework and regeneration funds, we work with local authorities to bring forward their ideas and create synergies with the broader housing funding.  We want to create opportunities for smaller towns and villages, in a rural development context, to become the focus for a series of things to happen.  We want people to choose to live in such places and set up businesses and, therefore, we must support their broader social and economic life.  One rarely achieves planning objectives through restrictions.  One creates planning objectives by creating opportunities, which is what this document seeks to do.  <\/p><p> Deputy Cowen and Senator Boyhan have raised many issues about advice and training.  We acknowledge that decision-making for planning has become more complex.  Local authority members have more issues to deal with and, in some cases, larger geographical areas.  It is very important, in the context of good decision-making, that we support elected members at local level through effective training, advice and so on.  My colleague, Mr. Hogan, has reminded me that an office for planning regulation will be established when the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill is enacted.  One of the three pillars for establishing such an office is to ensure that there is effective training, education, technical support, etc. for members.  We has not spent enough time and effort on increasing awareness and improving the technical understanding of the various legislative requirements.  It is very important that we do so because one of the areas that may become more litigious in the future, which has happened in the environment impact assessment, EIA, process, is how environmental assessments and all of the legal requirements are reflected in the development plan process. <\/p><p> Like all of my colleagues, I worked in local authorities for many years before joining the Department.  The Department is lucky to have staff who understand how the system works at a grassroot level and central level.  I understand, having worked as part of the executive for local authorities, that we very much worked for the executive and on behalf of the members of local authorities.  I understood that our role was to give that advice, engage, listen, check and double check the situation.  I shall leave that question there as to the appropriateness or otherwise of adding a third party to the advice-giving role for members as part of the deliberative and policy processes in terms of planning matters, etc.  The role of the office for planning regulation will put in place a rigorous and regular process of training, support and advice giving on a regional basis, quarterly basis, etc.  That is something we need to progress, as a matter of urgency and I hope that will happen when the legislation is enacted.   <\/p><p> The Department has always supported the work of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, etc.  We are always available, and very anxious to make ourselves available, to those representative organisations for local authority members.  We are always happy to answer all of their questions.<\/p><p> My broader team of colleagues and I are always happy to engage with local authority members but obviously not in the context of council meetings.  In a previous life I recall that a number of workshops were provided to elected members in the midland counties.  The Department could arrange similar workshops now.  It would allow the Department to answer questions from the elected members.  It would afford the Department an opportunity to explain the rationale behind its policy and how that works at local level, etc.  It is difficult for us to constantly work with 31 local authorities.  We are more than willing to make ourselves available to facilitate workshops that provide technical training and advice giving exercises.  We provide technical support to local authorities in terms of their planning functions.  We have no difficulty with interacting with members whether it is through strategic policy committees, SPCs, or working groups, etc.  I wish to stress that we are more than willing and able to do so. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1994,"content":"<p>Can the Department arrange workshops so that people can drop by to discuss issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#M00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1521711000,"counter":1995,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#M00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521711000,"counter":1996,"content":"<p>My Department colleagues and I have manned a stand at the National Ploughing Championships for the past few years and we talked to hundreds of people on those occasions.

I refer to Deputy O'Dowd's comments about transparency.  Having been involved in a local authority for 12 years, I have gone through three county development plans.  I think we have moved on as a country, the planning process has moved on and there is transparency through all stages of the county development plan process.  That is a positive step from where we were a number of decades ago.  Having gone through three county development plans, I must put that on record.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cussen talks about the importance of place-making, and we argue about population and its importance.  Rightly or wrongly, everything in the county development plan relates to population, population targets and everything from the zoning of lands, education needs and community needs down even to the sustainability of that county through the local property tax.  All this has a huge role in the county development plan.  Regrettably, population, rightly or wrongly, is the key component of each county development plan.  I know why there is a hands-off approach, and that will be decided at a regional level.  I am slightly concerned about Wicklow because we did comply with national spatial strategy and we did not break the guidelines.  We adhered to them, unlike other counties.  We suffer the consequences of that today because we will not have the same proportion of population growth out of what has been allocated to the regional authorities simply because others went ahead and blew it.  Both Kildare and Meath got critical rail infrastructure out of the national development plan process; Wicklow got nothing.  That is just a practical example of population having a hugely significant role to play from the start right down to community infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to rural planning because I am a little obsessed with it, coming as I do from a one-off rural house myself.  I understand the pressure that is on one-off rural housing.  Coming from Wicklow, I think we have a good record in how we manage one-off rural houses.  This is why it goes back to the criteria of qualification as opposed to being under an urban shadow or a rural shadow in that one either qualifies or does not qualify.  What I am slightly concerned about is this housing demand assessment.  If I am reading Ms Walsh right, when we are deciding county plans we are deciding core strategies.  We are saying, for example, 50% of our houses will be one-off rural houses.  In the next six years Wicklow can have 350 one-off rural houses, but God love me if I am applicant No. 356 and I do not qualify.  Regarding rural housing, one either has a need to live in the rural area or one does not, and allocating a proportion of percentage growth to that will be hard to work out.  It is just a complicated process.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, we are entering into a new era with the office of the planning regulator being brought in, something that we have not seen before.  Our national planning framework, or the regional local plans, will all have to adhere to that, and it is probably not moving in the right direction.  Equally, I acknowledge that the Government has accepted Fianna F&aacute;il's amendment to bring transport under that oversight.  I felt it was critical we do that.  I spoke to the witnesses earlier about TII and I will speak to them after the meeting about it.  It is critical TII does not become the deciding factor of what happens at national, regional and local level.  It must adhere to national, regional and local policy.  This is clearly still not happening at present.  It thinks it is driving the bus.  I will show the witnesses that correspondence later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018032200002#N00900","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521711000,"counter":2012,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman.

I refer Deputies to the letter I wrote to the Minister in response to his letter.  They will have received a copy by email yesterday.  I thank Fiona for sending them out.<\/p><p>My intention in introducing the Bill, which has been signed by a significant number of Deputies, is to ensure that our public water system is not privatised in the future.  This is a key concern of the Right2Water campaign.  People saw the introduction of charges and metering as a means for commodifying water and preparing the basis for privatisation.  Every Deputy should have received emails from the Right2Water campaign in the past few days showing that hundreds of people signed up calling for the committee to support the referendum.  I received a few Fianna F&aacute;il responses.  Deputy O'Dea said he was in favour of the referendum.  Deputy Scanlon said &quot;Thank you for your email, Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports the 35th amendment on public ownership and will support a referendum to enshrine it in our Constitution.&quot;  I hope that will be the tone of today's meeting.<\/p><p>Increasingly water is viewed as a key resource with the potential of high profitability by the major transnational corporations.  It is, in effect, the new oil.  It would be extremely foolish to believe that these companies will not look to get their hands on this resource in Ireland.<\/p><p>As I stated in my letter, it is worth noting that this issue was the single biggest concern of the public as evidenced in the number of submissions to the expert commission on the funding of domestic water services and was one of the key recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  I again emphasise that we would be foolish to think that our water is not on the horizon for big transnational companies.  The following is a quote from Willem Buiter, who is Citigroup's chief economist:<\/p><blockquote>I expect to see in the near future a massive expansion of investment in the water sector, including the production of fresh, clean water from other sources... storage, shipping and transportation of water.  I expect to see pipeline networks that will exceed the capacity of those for oil and gas today.<br \/><br \/>I see fleets of water tankers (single-hulled!) and storage facilities that will dwarf those we currently have for oil, natural gas and LNG. <\/blockquote> <p>He continued to outline the thinking behind financial institutions:<\/p><blockquote>Water as an asset class will, in my view, become eventually the single most important physical-commodity based asset class, dwarfing oil, copper, agricultural commodities and precious metals.<\/blockquote> <p>He is bang on.  Official figures show water producing twice the operating surplus and paying twice the dividends to shareholders in water firms compared with any other class of investment other than financial services.  That just shows how profitable water is to these big transnational companies.<\/p><p>A constitutional amendment would protect against the threat of a government being strong-armed by an external authority.  We saw that when the troika came into Greece.  If anyone wants me to go into those details, I have the information.  Greece was forced to privatise its water on the basis that it had structures already there and companies set up.<\/p><p>The committee should also note that the Bill was unopposed on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  There was no request for a vote.  I understand the Government indicated it wanted to look for any unintended consequences.<\/p><p>I believe that in a referendum there would be widespread public support to insert this provision into the Constitution.  I am disappointed that despite the considerable length of time since the Bill passed Second Stage, neither the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, nor the present Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has made any formal proposal and the Minister still claims he is awaiting advice from the Attorney General.<\/p><p>I am also disappointed that on two occasions in December and February I asked the Minister to meet me, as he indicated he would in his letter to the committee in February.  He said that he would be happy to meet the sponsors of the Bill to discuss these points and the further approaches to be adopted and progressed in the Bill.  I wrote a letter to the Minister and he came back on 23rd February and said he would meet but not before being properly briefed on the legislation etc.  I am still waiting for that meeting I was advised to seek.<\/p><p>It is strange that neither the Department nor Irish Water seems to be able to distinguish between what is a public water system, for which is it responsible, and the private system, such as group water schemes and private boreholes.  This seems to be an area where there are most concerns about possible unintended consequences.  I would be very happy to discuss any word changes or amendments that would help clarify this issue, provided so doing does not in any way water down the key aims of the constitutional amendment.<\/p><p>I attended a meeting in December at which the Parliamentary Legal Adviser presented her legal opinion on the Bill.  The issue of a clarifying Bill was raised.  As I also set out in my letter to the Minister, one clear solution to this would be for the Government to draft legislation in advance of any referendum, providing legal clarity on these issues.  The legislation would simply be a clarifying Bill setting out exactly what is in the public system and what is not, and detailing the responsibility of the State with respect to both the public and private systems.  Such clarifying legislation could be introduced in advance of a referendum.<\/p><p>On the issue of where the amendment should be placed in the Constitution, it is my view - based on the legal advice given to me by S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail SC, who helped draw up the proposal with the Right2Water campaign - that the amendment should be placed in Article 28, which deals with the responsibilities of the State.  Inserting the amendment into Article 10 or Article 40 would not be sufficient in keeping the public water system in public ownership and management.  Article 10 simply confers general rights, which often have to be validated through the courts system.<\/p><p>In his opening statement provided to the committee for a meeting on 4 May 2017, S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail stated:<\/p><blockquote>The key aim of the proposed amendment is to provide constitutional protection for the public water system by clarifying and &lsquo;copper fastening&rsquo; the Government&rsquo;s ownership on behalf of the Irish people and responsibilities in this regard.  By preventing these responsibilities from being re-assigned, devolved or delegated to private interests it is preventative and protective in nature.<br \/><br \/>It aims to confer certain responsibilities clearly on the government in terms of retaining ownership of the public water system, and ensuring the asset is protected, managed and maintained in the public interest.  This can be most clearly and effectively achieved through Article 28[. It] deals with the Executive arm of the State and provides that it is collectively responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The powers and responsibilities of central and local government as set out within Article 28.<br \/><br \/>Article 28 of the Constitution provides that the Government is collectively responsible for the Departments of State.  It is also not unprecedented for the Constitution to assign specific responsibilities on the Government; [Article 29.4.1&deg;] assigns the Government with the responsibility for the external affairs of the State.  Conferring responsibilities on the Executive is more effective and precise than using a rights-based approach by inserting rights into Article 40.<\/blockquote> <p>We have spent considerable time on scrutiny and discussion of the legislation.<\/p><p>We have taken evidence from my legal adviser, S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail, and there is legal advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser, OPLA, which has taken evidence from the Department officials, and the former Minister, Deputy Coveney.  There has been sufficient scrutiny and as no amendments have been tabled, I request the committee to now move the Bill to the next Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018032200002#E01000","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521729000,"counter":2034,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Joan Collins for the work she and her team have done on the Bill.  Our party was very proud to be a co-signatory of the Bill, at her request, as many other Deputies were.  We are 15 months on from the passing of Second Stage of the Bill.  As Deputy Joan Collins says, we have had much discussion.  Throughout that discussion several contributors have expressed concerns at the wording of the amendment.  I accept their sincerity.  The Minister and his predecessor outlined concerns orally and in writing.  The National Federation of Group Water Schemes has done so and the written advice from the OPLA also outlined those concerns.  It would be remiss of the committee to dismiss those or not take them seriously given that this is a proposed amendment of the Constitution.<\/p> <p>  Our discussion with the legal representative from the OPLA was very interesting because she shared several of the concerns the Minister outlined in his letter to the committee.  We had a very interesting conversation because the concerns are about the absence of a legal definition of the water system, the public water system, where public ownership stops and where private and group ownership start.  If that is not defined could there be ownership conflicts and legal challenges on the other side of a successful referendum?  What do the key words in the Bill, the \"protection, management and maintenance\" of that system mean?  What is the responsibility of the State, central government, local government or agents of the State such as Irish Water in protection, management and maintenance in respect of the private and group schemes?  We made a sensible suggestion, which was not the suggestion of the OPLA, but our own, that if it is clarified in law and stated very clearly in legislation what the public system is, where it starts and stops, and the same for the non-public system, and if we define the responsibility of the State and its agents with respect to protection, management and maintenance before the referendum, those concerns are dealt with.  That would take some time but those of us who want to see that constitutional protection would be more than happy to work with the Department and Minister in producing that legislation because we want to make sure that if there is constitutional protection it is done in the right way and without negative consequences for people, whether on the voluntary or statutory side currently providing water services.  That is my response to the concern I anticipate the Minister will raise today. <\/p> <p>  The water debate was very divisive.  Those of us who sat on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services will have fond memories of those sessions.  The one issue that was not divisive, however, was that of constitutional protection of the public water system.  The trade union movement was very divided about water charges, some took an active role in campaigning against them, some stayed neutral and others took the view that it was a sensible move.  All of those unions, particularly in the context of the negotiations on Irish Water's single utility proposal, are saying they would like to see the constitutional protection because it would reassure their members that, whatever the detail of the industrial relations issues that transpire, they would have the protection of being public sector workers working for a public utility in the public good.  That reflects the fact that the largest number of submissions to the expert commission on domestic water services was on this issue and polling data indicate strong public support.<\/p> <p>  Leaving aside the merits of the constitutional protection, if the Minister is keen to achieve a positive outcome with the unions on the single utility, an issue where he and I probably disagree on some of the details, this referendum is even more important now than prior to the single utility proposal.  There is a solution to these concerns and I take those concerns very seriously.  I and others supporting the Bill are willing to work with the Government to deal with those concerns prior to any referendum to ensure that everybody benefits from good legislation and what could be a good referendum campaign. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018032200002#F00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1521729000,"counter":2035,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to join the committee for Committee Stage of the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill (Water in Public Ownership) (No. 2) Bill 2016.  I acknowledge the work of Deputy Joan Collins in bringing it forward and the active engagement to date of other Members of these Houses.  I have not received the Deputy's recent letter and I agreed to meet with her but the meeting was not requested.  I agreed to appear before the committee but that meeting was postponed.  For my part, I am not trying to avoid debating or discussing the merits of this proposed amendment to the Constitution but in dealing with the sections of the Bill I want to advise the committee on the Government's position.<\/p><p>The Bill has two sections and the wording of the proposed amendment is set out in two parts that are contained within the Schedule.  I would like to speak directly to the provisions of the Bill as appropriate on Committee Stage.  I have written to the committee to provide my views on the Bill and the wording of the amendment.  Much of what I have to say reiterates points in my letter.  It is important, however, to record these matters in the Official Report.  There is a great deal of detail involved and I ask the committee to bear with me.  <\/p><p>My predecessor in this Department, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, attended the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill last May.  He observed that during the Second Stage debate there was a common view on all sides of the House that the State should own the vital public service that is water.  Deputy Joan Collins observed at that time that the public at large holds this view.  I share both perspectives.  <\/p><p>I reiterate that I remain strongly committed to working with the committee to advance an appropriate constitutional amendment.  Such an amendment must be capable of achieving the policy aim, which is to provide an insurance against the transfer into private ownership of a national water services authority.  This would be in keeping with the recommendation of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, which both Houses have adopted.  I support this recommendation.<\/p><p>The Bill, however, raises several significant concerns which require attention and it should not therefore be adopted in its current form.  I am also of the view that any amendment of the Bill would require proper legal scrutiny.  No amendments have been tabled but I hope there is scope to amend the Bill further on Committee Stage.  I therefore ask the committee not to vote to approve the sections of the Bill as currently cast.  I am happy to work further with the committee and directly with the Bill's sponsors.<\/p><p>I acknowledge and respect that there are different views of the Bill and its potential impacts.  Some of these were heard during the scrutiny hearings and the previous debates.  I set out my views as Minister having engaged extensively with the Attorney General on the many questions arising from the Bill, having given careful consideration to its potential policy implications, having reviewed a report of the OLPA submitted on 14 December 2017 that I received as an <i>ex officio<\/i>member of the committee and having reviewed the committee's own report on its scrutiny of the Bill.  In my recent letter I set out the issues and concerns which I believe fall to be considered by the sponsors of the Bill, ideally in collaboration with the committee and with me.  <\/p><p>The Bill seeks to insert a new provision into the Constitution under Article 28.  This provision would effectively mean that the Government would be &quot;collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system.&quot;  The Government would be bound to ensure &quot;in the public interest that this resource remains in public ownership and management.&quot;  As Minister, I accept that it may not be possible to achieve certainty of outcome whatever the wording of a constitutional amendment.  We have to ensure, however, that the wording proposed for insertion achieves as high a degree of clarity as possible and is robust.  I do not think this is the case at present.  The proposed amendment can be read and argued in different ways, which makes for uncertainty and unpredictability.  There are significant risks in the wording of the Bill in so far as the meanings of the key terms such as &quot;protection&quot;,&quot;management&quot;, &quot;maintenance&quot;, &quot;public water system&quot; and &quot;ownership&quot; are not clearly defined and may not lend themselves to precise definition within the Constitution.  These key terms in the Bill are not self-evident and can be interpreted in different ways.  This raises questions and concerns about the impact of the amendment on how water services are operated and delivered in this jurisdiction.  It also creates the potential for unforeseen consequences or unintended implications which can arise when the amendment falls to be interpreted by the courts.<\/p><p>In respect of the impact on the existing arrangement for the provision of water services, the wording leaves the following matters open to question: public water system, it is not clear what falls within the public water system and for instance whether it includes infrastructure, ancillary services such as water quality services or how it applies to public waters on private lands.  The question arises of whether provision could prevent the use of private facilities by the public water system or, alternatively, the use of public facilities in water services arrangements that have private elements.  In many instances there are hybrid schemes in place.  These group water schemes involve an intermingling of private water initiatives, which serve significant numbers of the public and public entities.  In some instances the water is supplied by Irish Water or the scheme is supported by State funding or both.  It is not clear how this amendment would apply to or affect these arrangements, a concern that has been raised separately by the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.<\/p><p> It is not clear from the amendment what might be meant by the term \"maintenance\" and what implications might arise from the possible elevation of this responsibility to the level of a solemn constitutional duty.  As policy makers, we need to have an understanding of how the term \"maintenance\" might be interpreted and the costs that might arise for citizens in the raising of public revenues by placing such an obligation on the Government through the Constitution.  There is the risk that it would make the provision constitutionally justiciable.  For example, we do not know how the courts might deal with cases where there were routine disruptions of the water supply.  Questions arise about whether such instances might be constitutionally justiciable and what the implications of public policy might be for the Exchequer.<\/p><p> The amendment, as framed, might give rise to a question about the extent to which it might permit a role for local authorities in the delivery of public water services.  I would not want to see a situation where the Bill could create ambiguity or any problem concerning the role of local authorities in that regard.  Likewise, the question arises as to what tests would be applied in seeking to establish how a national water services body such as Irish Water might be considered to be in public ownership.  It is important that the amendment not prevent the sale or disposal of obsolete assets or assets that will be decommissioned in the future.<\/p><p> The Bill would make the Government directly and collectively responsible for the management of the public water system.  Based on the wording, it is unclear whether and to what extent the Government could delegate its responsibility for the management of the public water system to third parties.  There is a question about the extent to which the Government might be obliged to monitor, oversee and\/or directly manage the provision of water services.  For instance, it might be argued that the amendment would restrict the scope of legislation to allow for another entity to perform these functions and\/or require the Government to manage the activities of Irish Water, possibly even in routine operational matters.  At a minimum, it would seem to give rise to some uncertainty in practice.  As policy makers, it behoves us to clarify our intentions in framing a constitutional amendment and represent them clearly in legislation, not just in debate.  It is the text of the Bill that the courts would use in making an interpretation, rather than what might or might not have been our intentions, as legislators.<\/p><p> It is not exactly clear what is meant by the term \"protection\".  Given that it is a constitutional amendment, it seems likely that the courts would strive to give meaning to the term.  There is a risk that it could be read in an expansive way, placing a constitutional duty on the Government in the provision of water services.<\/p><p> Cumulatively, the references to public ownership and maintenance and management by the Government might throw into question the capacity of Irish Water or a water services authority to enter into or conclude public private partnerships and design, build and operate contracts.  It could also be argued that the use by Irish Water or a water services authority of contractors would be restricted in respect of activities involving aspects of the management or maintenance of the public water system.  As matters stand, contractors are engaged in a variety of arrangements to enable delivery to meet certain aspects of statutory obligations attached to the provision of water and wastewater services.  I understand the necessity or desirability of using such contractual arrangements in the provision of water services is not universally accepted and can be the subject of policy debate, but my concern is that these practices might no longer be feasible as options in the delivery of water and wastewater services, which could have the effect of undermining existing planned and future arrangements in managing and delivering water and wastewater infrastructure and services.<\/p><p> In the absence of a clearly codified understanding of what is meant by the various terms used in the Bill, it would fall to the courts to give an interpretation.  It is the uncertainty surrounding what such an interpretation might be that raises potentially significant problems.  There is a risk that many of the questions and concerns I have outlined would be litigated in the courts.  In a constitutional context, the courts would strive to give meaning to any ill-defined term and there is a risk that the provision could be read in different ways.  While there would be arguments and counter-arguments for any particular proposition, there can be no certainty as to how the provision would be interpreted by the courts.<\/p><p> The amendment might have the effect of positively requiring the Government to make provision to extend the public water system to areas not covered by the system or, at least, to provide some resources to ensure they would have access to a water service directly comparable to the public system.  While the amendment does not require this directly, the fact that the Government would be responsible for managing \"in the public interest\" a public water system might lead to demands from persons not connected to the system.  The constitutional recognition and protection given to the public water system might reinforce this.  It is difficult to be certain how a court might deal with such an argument.<\/p><p> In other contexts, the courts have been reluctant to interfere with legislative choice or Executive discretion in the allocation of resources.  In this case, the amendment is discrete, specific and novel in nature.  Therefore, how it would be interpreted in practice by the courts cannot be predicted with certainty.  I accept that it might be argued by some that placing a constitutional obligation on the Government in respect of rights in this area was desirable from a policy point of view.  The risk, however, is that any such implied right would have to be balanced against other rights and decisions on future policy priorities the Government and the Oireachtas might wish to make.  For example, they might be restricted in their scope to make decisions on practical policy matters in the provision of water services.  This could impact on the allocation of State resources, including the provision of infrastructure and services in other policy areas.  It would be surprising if elevating the new provision to the level of a formal constitutional duty had no impact on the current system.  The risk is that we do not know and cannot predict what the impact would be.  As a member of the Government and a legislator, I find this problematic to the point where I consider it necessary to look at alternative approaches.<\/p><p> I will address the location of the proposed amendment when we reach the relevant Part.<\/p><p> Having considered the advice of the Attorney General and that of the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser received by the committee, my reservations about particular aspects of the Bill are well founded.  I stress that I do not doubt the intent or sincerity of those Deputies who have sponsored the Bill and that these observations do not in any way detract from my commitment to work with the committee to advance an appropriate constitutional amendment capable of ensuring water services will continue in public ownership in keeping with the recommendation of the joint Oireachtas committee in April 2017 which was approved by both Houses.  If the intent of the constitutional protection is to ensure the national water services authority cannot be privatised, it seems more appropriate that the focus should be on the entity supplying the service.  Therefore, there is scope to work on developing a model that will seek to ensure the entity responsible for the provision of water services will not be placed in private ownership.  It seems such an approach would be less likely to give rise to the difficult questions and concerns I have outlined.  To this end, my Department and I propose to engage further with the Office of the Attorney General.  The legal advice received is clear in raising issues with the Bill that need to be addressed on Committee Stage and I ask the committee to have regard to that advice.  I also urge it to defer consideration of this matter pending further engagement by my Department and I with the Attorney General on a more robust wording.  I reiterate that I am willing to collaborate closely with the committee in this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018032200002#F00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521729000,"counter":2037,"content":"<p>I noted the Taoiseach's comments when he was asked about the Bill.  He made a case against progressing with it on the grounds that it was not urgent and no longer necessary.  That is interesting because he did not argue against the Bill on legal or technical grounds but on political grounds.  Is he right?  Is it no longer urgent or necessary?  Then and only then must the technical issues be considered.  That is my party's view on the issue.<\/p> <p>  People can shout from the rooftops, but a privatisation agenda was clearly part and parcel of the debate on the introduction of water charges.  Has that agenda gone away?  <\/p> <p>  Regarding a move towards having a single utility in the form of Irish Water, the plan was for it to be completed by 2025.  The current proposal is for it to be completed by 2021.  In my party's view, the move towards a single utility would facilitate a privatisation agenda.  Without drilling down too far into it, the move to a single utility, plus the service level agreements, would not result in changes to the wages, conditions and pensions of current staff and the unions are sufficiently strong to guarantee this.  The question is about what would happen to new hires.  When Mr. Jerry Grant of Irish Water appeared before us a few weeks ago, he did not rule out - not by a long shot - Irish Water being in a situation where new hires would be on lower wages and reduced conditions and pensions.  Time and again in recent years in State and semi-State companies, that type of scenario has facilitated a privatisation agenda.  A company does not opt for compulsory redundancies, but it lets time take its course and the company applies pressure in various ways such that there are fewer and fewer staff on the older and higher wage levels and more new staff on the lower levels.  That makes the company more attractive to those in the private sector who wish to own and control it.<\/p><p>A process which does not <i>ipso facto <\/i>lead to privatisation but can greatly facilitate privatisation is being speeded up, and the 2025 deadline has now become 2021.  I and many other people who marched and campaigned during the water charges movement suspect that what the water charges movement has achieved is the defeat of a short-term agenda of moving towards privatisation and that now, for those in the establishment who support it, it has become more of a medium-term aim.  Is the idea of an anti-privatisation, keep water in public ownership Bill or referendum still something which still has relevance?  Our political conclusion is that it is absolutely relevant.  There are legal and technical issues.  No Bill is perfect.  However, if there are legal and technical issues we should let the Bill proceed to the next Stage and table amendments, which are debated and teased out, and the Bill is honed and sharpened to the point where it is watertight, if the committee will excuse the pun.  We then proceed on that basis.<br\/><br\/>I am wary of the argument that suggests that the entity is kept in public ownership and therefore there is no need to have that copper-fastened by way of a referendum.  There are ways in which an entity can be kept in public ownership but, through design-build-operate, outsourcing or contracting, we are led to a situation where large elements of the system are privatised.  That is not a sufficient bulwark against privatisation.  I am wary of those who clearly had a privatisation agenda yesterday, who got knocked back by the anti-water charge movement and who are arguing for that arrangement today.  They say it is a bulwark against privatisation but it could actually help to facilitate it.<br\/><br\/>I believe there is a need for a Bill and a referendum.  If technical issues arise they can be sorted out via the normal mechanism, which is amendments at the next Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018032200002#G00200","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521729000,"counter":2039,"content":"<p>I want to talk about the recommendations of the expert commission and of the Oireachtas committee of which a number of us present were members.  The first recommendation of the summary of the expert commission said, under the heading of public ownership: \"As part of the overall approach to settling the issues addressed in this report the Expert Commission recommends that the adoption of a suitable constitutional provision on public ownership of water services be more fully addressed by the Special Oireachtas Committee, as part of its deliberations\".  We should respect that.  I agree that we need a constitutional provision to ensure that water services are kept in public ownership.  The Oireachtas committee also recommended this, and specifically referred to Deputy Joan Collins' Bill.  There is an onus to provide for a constitutional referendum.  The Oireachtas committee clearly agreed that by majority.  There certainly was a respect on all sides of the political divide for the recommendations of the expert commission, and I believe those recommendations should be implemented.<\/p> <p>  I recognise that the Minister has concerns about the language.  He spoke about considering alternatives and spoke about focusing on the entity rather than the system.  If this wording is not appropriate and not considered acceptable, there is an onus on Government to come forward with proposals, or at least amendments, that would achieve the result of providing for a referendum, because that is clearly the desire of both the committee and the commission.<\/p> <p>  I do not support Deputy Barry's theory of a privatisation agenda.  I do not believe there was such an agenda.  In fact, certain provisions were put into legislation to prevent privatisation.  However, I agree that we need to go a step further and have a constitutional referendum.  There is a public fear that water services will be privatised, and that has to be addressed, which is why we have to find acceptable language.<\/p> <p>  I am here to support the proposals of Deputy Collins and her colleagues.  In fact, my colleague, Deputy Penrose, also published a Bill, and I believe some other Bills were published as well.  His wording was slightly different and provided that electricity and gas transmission and distribution networks, the public water supply and waste water treatment services - which must also be specified - shall be maintained in public ownership.  That Bill was published in May 2016.<\/p> <p>  While I cannot vote, I express the support of the Labour Party for ensuring that agreed wording is found which will ensure that this matter proceeds to a constitutional referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018032200002#H00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1521729000,"counter":2040,"content":"<p>The expert commission, the Oireachtas committee and the D&aacute;il all agreed that the ownership of water services be enshrined in the Constitution by means of a referendum.  This Bill sought to do that.  I thank Deputy Collins for her forbearance and patience as we sit at this apparent impasse.  As the Deputy mentioned, the Bill had the support of the D&aacute;il in its efforts to reflect and to ensure that that commitment would honoured.  It is disappointing that the Government has not proposed amendments to reflect the opinion that has been furnished to it by the Attorney General, or a wording to address the fears of unintended consequences for private and group water schemes as related to us by the Minister.<\/p> <p>  Voting for the Bill in its present form is compromising private and group water schemes, and that is not something I wish to have to do.  Against that background, and taking into account what has been said here today and based on the commitment and consensus that exists, there is an onus of responsibility on the Government to act.  This is notwithstanding the fact that we have been waiting for 15 months for amendments to be proposed.  It was unanimously agreed in the D&aacute;il that this issue be addressed in the way this Bill seeks.  We have not only heard from the Minister and the Government but also the Confederation of Group Water Schemes.  A legal presentation was also made available to us by the Oireachtas as well.  Based on that information, it is incumbent that a correct wording to reflect the fears of unintended consequences be found.<\/p><p>To that end, I hope there would be agreement for deferral and a timescale put in place to seek to hold the Government and its drafters to account in providing the relevant wording that would meet their approval.  In itself, this would dispel the fears that Deputy Barry raised in quoting some of the Taoiseach's comments in response to questions about this recently.  I expect that is not the view of the Government as I heard the Minister relay the commitment to this process.  I ask the committee's indulgence to see if we can agree a deferral and put some time limit on a process that would allow the Government to meet Deputy Joan Collins and give her some assurance, as proposer of the Bill, that the process has an end game rather than it petering out.  The same fears referred to by other speakers remain and will only grow in many minds with regard to the aspirations of the D&aacute;il not being met.  It could go to the contrary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018032200002#H00300","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521729000,"counter":2042,"content":"<p>We are on Committee Stage.

I genuinely want to believe the Minister.  We have battles over policy but I always think that with a constitutional referendum, having the maximum degree of consensus is the best way to go.  It is the best way to guarantee in a referendum campaign, if and when it happens, that the question is passed.<\/p> <p>  The frustration on this side of the House is the length of time that he and his predecessor have been telling us that they want to work with us, while in all that time, as Deputy Cowen notes, no alternative proposals have been put on the table.  It is about 15 months.  We were originally told by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Coveney, that he wanted to consult the Attorney General and he gave the impression it would come back to us.  We gave him quite a lot of time to do that.  There was a change in Minister and Deputy Eoghan Murphy came into the position.  We have dealt with him since.<\/p> <p>  If the Minister had made the proposal for us to postpone this a year ago or even six or seven months ago, it would have been reasonable and I would certainly have had no difficulty with it.  We are 15 months on from the passing of the Bill on Second Stage and there is no amendment or alternative proposal.  Again, if the Government argued that the Bill cannot be amended but it had a better alternative proposition, nobody on this side of the House would have refused to engage, formally or informally, to tease all of that out.  On that basis, at this stage I cannot accept a postponement of the legislation.<\/p> <p>  Some of the matters raised by the Minister were dealt with pretty comprehensively by Mr. S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail when he presented to the committee.  He spoke, for example, about management by third parties, whether they were design and build; design, build and operate; or public private partnerships.  Notwithstanding the fact that I do not like those models and my understanding is Irish Water does not like those models because they are not the most cost-effective, Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail's legal advice to the committee was that the constitutional referendum as proposed does not jeopardise any such arrangements.  They would be a management decision for the public authority as set out.  Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail dealt with the sale of obsolete assets very comprehensively, saying that once an asset is obsolete it is no longer part of the public system or the functioning water and sanitation network.  Its decommissioning automatically means it is excluded from the terms and protections of the wording and therefore can be sold or dismantled.<\/p> <p>  I note neither the Minister nor Deputy Cowen responded to the solution we put forward on the uncertainty aspect.  I know the Minister was not at the committee meeting when the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor gave detailed advice and therefore he did not have the benefit of the subsequent conversation.  The best way to avoid that uncertainty falling to the courts is for the Government to legislate that uncertainty away.  The solution to those problems identified by the Minister - I stress the Minister's sincerity in this - is not to change the wording but rather to clarify the matters in law before any constitutional amendment so everybody can have legal clarity in terms of what is public and what is not, and what protection, management and maintenance means.  The argument is that this may lead to additional obligations on the State to provide public water to people who are not currently in the system.  I genuinely do not see how that is possible as this deals with the public system as it currently exists and the responsibilities of the State in that respect.  Again, clarifying legislation could deal with that.<\/p> <p>  I will not repeat all these points when we go through the parts of the legislation and Deputy Collins can speak for herself but we have waited long enough.  Our preference at this stage is that we decide on this.  If the Government is opposed to this or Fianna F&aacute;il cannot support it in its current form, people should know that and we should decide and move on.  If this is rejected today, my understanding is it is to be sent back to the D&aacute;il because it has not passed Committee Stage.  The clerk might clarify that.  It still would not mean the matter goes away.  If the Government is not accepting this but it is committed to honouring fully the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee on the future funding of water services, it will have to come up with an alternative proposal at some stage.  Why not allow us to proceed at this stage and do it on Report Stage or when it goes to the Seanad?  It would help us get this done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018032200002#J00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1521729000,"counter":2046,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for those contributions.  I say to Deputy Barry that there is no other agenda here.  When the Taoiseach made his comments he would of course have been speaking to the spirit of the Bill and not the legal text that is before us now, as we are speaking about a Bill that brings about a referendum to amend the Constitution in a very specific way.  We must focus on that legal text and what the implications might be from that text if it were to be inserted in the Constitution.<\/p> <p>  I agree that there are more urgent referendums that need to take place.  I am thankful that as a result of a decision of the D&aacute;il yesterday, we hope one of those referendums will be taking place very shortly.  It is good that it is happening.  Most people will rightly agree that the Bill taken yesterday is more urgent than this one.  There is no privatisation agenda or proof thereof.  It is important to ask, even in the absence of constitutional protection, how the public water system could be privatised, given the triple-lock that is in place.  There are huge barriers currently in place that again inform how urgent this Bill or referendum might be versus others that many people in the D&aacute;il want to see.  There is lengthy list of them.<\/p> <p>  Moving to a single authority or utility allows us to have a more efficient response both in terms of financially deploying resources and also in times of crisis.  We saw with storms Ophelia and Emma how having a single utility can be more effective in fixing disruptions to service in a timely manner.  The Deputy accepts there are legal and technical issues so why has he not provided amendments?  This is not a Government Bill and it comes from certain other sponsors.  If the Deputies accept those difficulties, where are the amendments to address them?<\/p> <p>  A Deputy referred to the recommendations that have been made and supported and I agree that the recommendation for a constitutional provision should not put group water schemes at risk.  It is a great fear that we have arising from advice from the Attorney General and separate advice to the committee.  This amendment would put group water schemes at risk.  The concerns about the language are shared not just by me as a Minister but in the legal advice received by the committee and the Attorney General.  This is not a Government Bill so the onus is not necessarily on the Government to provide amendments, but we have been trying to see how we can improve or amend the legislation.  We cannot do so and that is why we think there should be a whole new approach to trying to put a constitutional protection in place for water services.  We are working on that but it is a complex matter.  The risk of privatisation has been addressed but I still support the recommendation put forward and agreed last year.  This Bill does not address the recommendation.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Cowen notes, much work has been put into this.  I completely acknowledge that it is not simple to put together a Bill and persist with the legislation to try to meet the recommendation that the Oireachtas agrees with.  Unfortunately, this Bill does not do that.  The Deputy spoke about a Government amendment but it is not that simple because of the complexity of the water delivery services.  The Deputy knows that complexity full well.<\/p><p>Again, if it was simple, those amendments would already have been made and would have been brought forward by members of this committee or by other people.  I want to work together in trying to find the right type of amendment that might be made.  However, I believe this will require a different approach from that proposed in the current wording of the Bill.  As Deputy Cowen has pointed out, we should be concerned about unintended consequences on group water schemes because of the role they have in our communities in providing water to public people and public entities.<\/p><p> On a timeframe, we had meetings at the Office of the Attorney General recently to see how we can come up with a new direction and a new type of amendment that would put in place the necessary protections in the Constitution that would meet the recommendations of the Oireachtas.  I will endeavour to come back to the committee as quickly as possible, next week if I can, to outline a timeframe that might be acceptable to the committee in how we might do that.<\/p><p> On the concerns raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I think he is right about a Constitutional referendum.  We want to have as much consensus as possible.  As we approach this in terms of bringing a referendum to the people, which we will do, it should be a slam-dunk.  It should be very simple and easy and people should all be able to rally around it and say, \"Absolutely, we want to protect public water in the Constitution.\"  This Bill will not do that.  The Bill as currently drafted, even if we attempt to make amendments around the language, will raise concerns with members of the public in certain parts of the country as to what the eventual interpretation might be by a court of law when it comes to the actual language in the Constitution.  That is why I do not think the Bill can achieve what we all want to achieve, namely, public acceptance of a referendum when it is put to the people and to have that referendum agreed upon.<\/p><p> I do sense the Deputies' frustration.  I know it took a long time for the committee to get its own legal advice because it is a complex area.  However, there has been no delay on my part or on that of my office.  I note that a large part of last year was spent in dealing with the water services legislation that was taken through the House.<\/p><p> On opinions that were received from other people that this committee, legal opinions, ultimately, the courts will decide based on what is in the Constitution.  There will be different opinions on that, which speaks to the uncertainty that exists and the unpredictability of the proposed amendment.  Again, if it is so simple to define these things, I ask the Deputy to show me the definitions and how it was clarified.  We have tried and it is not simple.  I have to act on the advice of the Attorney General.  That is paramount for me as a Minister of the Government.  I do not want this issue to go away.  I want us to be able to resolve it because it is a recommendation that we accepted and I agree with it personally.  I do believe there are very significant protections in place already to protect any privatisation of the water system.  There is no agenda on my part or that of the Government to privatise the water system.  However, I accept that the public would be happier and would feel safer if there was a change to the Constitution that protected their water services from private ownership.  I will work with the committee to do that.   Unfortunately, this Bill will not achieve it in my view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018032200002#J00600","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521729000,"counter":2048,"content":"<p>Last year, the previous Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney was in this room and raised the same issues the current Minister has raised today.

I remember that at that meeting of 4 May 2017, Mr. S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail clearly explained that group water schemes are defined by their make-up, ownership, etc.  They have to apply to the local authority if they want to go back onto the public water system.  By that definition, they are a private water scheme even if they receive public water into the scheme.  He made it very clear that this is the case.  The Minister has given no evidence on his part.  I am sure group water scheme participants are wondering if they are private or public.  Irish Water obviously does not know and neither does the State, by what the Minister is saying.  Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail explained it in detail, however.  I suggest the members go back and read the transcript.<\/p><p>The fact that group water schemes receive water from the public water system does not change their status.  For example, where does Diageo get its water from?  It gets it from the public water system, as do thousands of other businesses.  Does this affect their status as being private companies?  No, it does not.  They are receiving public water and are supposed to pay for it.  That is a different situation.  Group water schemes are private schemes by definition and in how they operate and are set up in co-operatives or whatever.<\/p><p>I hear what the Minister is saying and I do want a Bill that would be robust in respect of the Constitution.  We did not propose any amendments because we feel that the Bill we presented is robust.  The Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser, OPLA, raised issues, which we discussed, and raised the possibility of legislation that could clarify, if necessary, where it stops and starts, what responsibility the Government would have etc.  If that is what the Minister is saying, I would be very supportive of taking a short period of time that we could look at the legislation and do it.  By all accounts, and given the record to date, I am afraid I have little confidence that there is seriousness in this regard.<\/p><p>When the committee asked me in December to approach the Minister, I wrote three letters to him.  I got a response from his constituency office, which forwarded the letter on to him.  I got no further response to that.  In response to the letter he provided to the committee in February, I wrote to him again and got a reply from him saying yes but that proper advice on legislation was needed.  Now we are coming to a crucial part of the debate and are being asked to postpone it again.  I do not have much faith in the process.  The Minister has had 16 months to do it.  I have made myself available to the Minister on numerous occasions.  He has not come back to us.  I am very sceptical about that approach.<\/p><p>On the utility, I think it is very dangerous putting a utility into the Constitution.  I do not think that is a possible situation.  It has been said to the committee that it is not an urgent Bill and is not on the referendum agenda.  I think there are 11 proposed referendums at the moment.  We are getting mixed messages.  In a letter he wrote to the unions, the Minister stated explicitly:<\/p><blockquote>Notwithstanding these provisions, I am willing to facilitate the holding of a referendum.  The question of a referendum is currently before the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) (No. 2) Bill 2016 has already been approved at Second Stage in the D&aacute;il as part of the legislative process.  There are issues around the timing of such a referendum in the first half of 2018 [that is the first we have heard about it] and challenges in framing the wording in such a way as to avoid adverse and unintended consequences.  I am committed to working with the Committee over the coming months to address these matters.<\/blockquote> <p>The unions replied and stated clearly that they are appealing to this committee to support the referendum and the Bill, stating: <\/p><blockquote>We believe that there is broad public support for the holding of a constitutional referendum to prevent the future privatisation of the public water system.  We note that the Minister has confirmed that he is willing to facilitate the holding of a referendum.  We understand that a Bill to give effect to the holding of a referendum will be considered at committee stage on 28 February 2018 [that was postponed].  We would urge all parties to co-operate to ensure that a referendum is held as soon as possible.  <\/blockquote> <p>That is part of a letter in respect of Irish Water and the proposed move to a single utility.<\/p><p>I really need something more tangible and more concrete coming from the Minister's side of the table.  I urge the other committee members to express that very strongly also.  The group water schemes are protected by their very nature.  S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail is an eminent senior counsel.  I do not know if the Minister has read his contributions to the committee last May.  I appeal to the committee not to let this wither away now.  While Deputy &Oacute; Broin said he would speak for me, I would prefer it to go to a vote.  I would prefer if it was taken here today and that, if necessary, it would go back to the D&aacute;il where we would have the debate.  If the Minister is serious, we should be sitting down and looking at legislation to try to deal with those issues of clarification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2018032200002#K00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1521729000,"counter":2049,"content":"<p>I formally propose that Committee Stage be postponed, that the Minister agree to consult Deputy Joan Collins and that the committee receive an update within two months on what progress, if any, has emanated from that process.

I have also spoken to Deputy Joan Collins on the matter.  I attend the D&aacute;il on every sitting day and always make myself available for meetings.

However, the risks to group water schemes are real, as noted in the independent advice received by the committee.  The amendment could affect the operation of group water schemes.

Amendment No. 1 seeks to redefine the word \"corruptly\".  The definition of \"corruptly\" contained in the Bill is the same as the definition contained in the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, as inserted by section 2 of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2010.  In developing this Bill, my officials and legal advisers considered a number of alternative approaches but concluded they were not in a position to change from what is a tried and tested definition.  The concept of \"corruptly\" is central to the construction of the offences in the Bill.  It was given careful consideration.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan's proposed wording defines \"corruptly\" as including acting in such a manner so as to secure an unlawful benefit.  There is no explanation of what constitutes an unlawful benefit and it appears that this would place an additional burden on the prosecution to prove that the benefit was indeed unlawful.  It also somewhat replicates the language in the offences themselves and this could create uncertainty, if not confusion.<\/p> <p>  The definition contained in the Bill is one that we know works.  We can look to successful prosecutions in this regard.  The definition has not given rise to any legal challenges in the courts.  It is a concept that juries appear to understand.  I ask Deputies to leave matters as they are on the basis of the definition being tried and tested.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 propose to insert an additional subcategory in the definition of an Irish official.

It is a directive on the fight against fraud to the Union&rsquo;s financial interests.  The purpose of amendments Nos. 4, 5, 13 and 14 is to deal with technical consequential matters arising from the requirement to transpose that directive.  As this Bill is intended to consolidate and clarify the law in respect of corruption, it is important that the amendments to give effect to this directive are inserted into the Bill prior to its enactment. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 4 amends the offence of passive corruption to include the act of requesting a gift, consideration or advantage.  The directive requires us to criminalise such behaviour and advice was sought on the issue. The Department was advised that it would be much clearer to include specific reference to requests, rather than rely on any common law interpretation that might be found.  Amendment No. 5 is essentially making the same change to the trading in influence offence. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 13 inserts the corruption offences and related definitions from the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 into Schedule 2 to the Bill in order that they be repealed.  International organisations such as the OECD have criticised Ireland in the past for having corruption offences in the main corruption legislation but also slightly differing corruption offences within the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  While we acknowledged the need for consistency in the Statute Book, it would have been imprudent to repeal the corruption offences in the 2001 Act until the new EU directive had been agreed.

Amendment No. 6, in the name of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, is much the same as the first of the three new presumptions proposed by Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan in amendment No. 7, although it is proposed that they will go into different places in the Bill and will relate to different offences.<\/p> <p>  Similar presumptions to those proposed by Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and O&rsquo;Callaghan for insertion into sections 13A(1)(i) and 13A(1)(ii) are already applicable to the offences in this Bill by virtue of the application of the Criminal Justice Act 2011.  Section 26 amends Schedule 1 to the 2011 Act by inserting a paragraph 28A which specifies that an offence under sections 5 to 10, inclusive, of the Bill will be included as a relevant offence for the purposes of the 2011 Act.   As a relevant offence includes an offence specified in Schedule 1 to the 2011 Act, the amendment to the Schedule to be made by section 26 would mean that the offences created by the Bill would become relevant offences for the purpose of the 2011 Act.  The Criminal Justice Act 2011 provides for a range of powers for the purposes of investigation and prosecution of criminal offences to which the Act applies, including presumptions relating to documentation in section 18 that are almost identical to the first two proposed here.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire proposes to insert his amendment into section 9 of the Bill, which is in Part 2, while the other presumptions are all contained in Part 4.  The presumptions under the 2011 Act are to be applied to offences under sections 5 to 10, inclusive, of this Bill.   The other presumptions in sections 14 to 16, inclusive, of the Bill apply only to those offences by virtue of the fact that they relate specifically to bribes, gifts, donations and other such tangible advantages.  There is little reason why presumptions relating to documentation could not be applied to the other offences in the Bill, such as those under sections 9 and 10.<\/p> <p>  I am minded not to accept this amendment for the reasons I have outlined.  Part (c) of the amendment proposed by Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan relates to a document retrieved from an electronic storage and retrieval system or electronic device.  I am aware that such a presumption exists in Revenue legislation and in the Competition Act 2012.   As I have said, the Criminal Justice Act 2011 contains its own presumptions and has a much broader definition of \"document\" than that in the 2012 Act and in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended.  It is not clear that the third presumption suggested by Deputy O'Callaghan is necessary in respect of the offences contained in this Bill.  I will have a look at this.  We might even meet between now and Report Stage with a view to preparing an amendment to deal with section 13A(1)(iii) so that we are all on the same page for Report Stage.  I do not think there is a huge difference between where we are now in any event.  This is the third proposed presumption from Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan relating to the retrieval of documents from electronic storage systems.  It is broad and assumes that all the documents on a laptop, computer or mobile phone were authored by the owner of the instrument.  While this is rebuttable, it could present a difficulty.  Given that an instrument could contain millions of documents, there might be an issue about the authorship of those documents.  I would not like to see the committee divided on this matter.  I will be happy to discuss it further with Deputy O'Callaghan with a view to bringing matters forward.  The same applies in the case of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018032200002#C00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1521732600,"counter":2100,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment is the first in this grouping.

The offence targets not the decision maker but those persons who have access to power and wish to corruptly use or abuse this access.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has not had a specific offence of trading in influence on the Statute Book to date and the proposed offence is new here.  In international fora, we have argued that the wider corruption offence contained in the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act is broad enough to include trading in influence.  GRECO, the Council of Europe anti-corruption body, did not accept our view on this and has recommended that Ireland introduce an autonomous offence of trading in influence in line with Article 12 of the Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption.  While that convention has a mandatory requirement for such an offence, the UN Convention against Corruption has also advised state parties to consider adopting trading in influence as a criminal offence when committed intentionally.<\/p> <p>  If we were to consider corruption offences on a spectrum from what might be considered lower level, more petty corruption to grand corruption on the far end, trading in influence would more often than not be at the lower end of the scale.  It has been referred to in textbooks as \"bearing the stench of corruption\".  It is for this reason that I have set the penalties as provided for in the section, namely, on summary conviction to a class A fine, forfeiture of the gift, consideration or advantage, and a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months; and, on conviction on indictment, to an unlimited fine, forfeiture of the gift, consideration or advantage and a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years.  A five-year maximum sentence is appropriate and proportionate.<\/p> <p>  As I stated, such an offence is usually at the lower end of the corruption scale.  Also, the proposed maximum sentence is very much in line with our international partners and possibly higher than most.  Italy has a maximum sentence of two years.  Spain also has a maximum sentence of two years but this increases to four years for public officials.  Norway, Belgium and Estonia have a maximum sentence of three years.  Malta is in the process of increasing its maximum sentence to three years.  New Zealand has a maximum sentence of seven years.  The only state of which I am aware that has a maximum sentence of ten years for trading in influence is France and this sentence only applies to public officials engaged in trading in influence.  Where a private individual is involved, the maximum sentence is five years.  I am not sure we should adopt the French model.<\/p> <p>  Section 7 addresses corruption by officials and this form of corruption attracts a maximum sentence of ten years.

It is the manner in which companies that have been put into a position under what is a new offence to disassociate themselves from the actions of people within that company and use a defence of plausible deniability.  I have made an attempt to tighten that up on the basis of a rebuttable presumption.  The amendment is structured on the basis of the obtaining or retaining of the same two qualifications as exist in section 18(1).  It states:<\/p><blockquote>... by way of obtaining or retaining&mdash;(i) business for the body corporate, or<br \/><br \/>(ii) an advantage in the conduct of business for the body corporate,<\/blockquote> <p>I have included the words, &quot;[...] there shall be a rebuttable presumption, that the body corporate was aware of the commission of the offence&quot;.  That is a rebuttable presumption and all the qualifications that apply to such a presumption.  After that reference to a rebuttable presumption I have inserted what is contained in section 18(2), which is that &quot; [...] it shall be a defence for a body corporate [...] that it took all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence&quot;.  It is sensible that where a company was not responsible for the actions of its employee and that employee or member of the organisation was acting in a personal capacity and with no knowledge or complicity from his or her superiors, that should be a reasonable defence, but it cannot be allowed to be used as a loophole.  It should not be too loose.  If the Minister has other observations about how that object might be achieved, I am open to hearing them but as things currently stand, sections 18(1) and 18(2) are too loose and need tightening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018032200002#E01600","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1521732600,"counter":2142,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.

I am not in a position to hold with him for the following reasons.  We are anxious to achieve a strict liability offence whereby the body corporate is held responsible if someone connected with the body corporate does something corrupt that is for the benefit of the body corporate.  Deputy O&rsquo;Laoghaire is attempting to introduce a rebuttable presumption that the body corporate knew but the next question will be, who knew?  If the individual&rsquo;s supervisor or direct colleagues knew, does that represent the body corporate being aware?  If, for example, the line manager knew but the directors did not know, is it questionable whether the body corporate was aware?<\/p> <p>  I know this is not Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's intention but I would be a bit concerned that the proposed amendment is introducing a concept of a presumption that someone in power in the company knew what was happening.  This adds further to the burden, and I believe it is an unnecessary layer.  The amendment makes provision as to what happens where the proposed presumption is rebutted, but it does not make clear what is to happen where the presumption is not rebutted.  This would cause uncertainty, and it may cause difficulties in achieving what we all want, which is a successful prosecution of what is an important offence.<\/p> <p>  It does not matter whether anyone in the body corporate knew.  The company is still guilty unless it can prove that it took all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of the offence.  The approach already in the Bill is cleaner and simpler.  The real purpose of this strict liability offence is to encourage companies to conduct due diligence and to take action to prevent corruption and corrupt acts.  On the issue of providing for a defence, I would say that if bodies corporate have no defence available to them, there would not be an incentive to conduct the formal due diligence we believe is necessary in the circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The concept of a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate knowing, consenting or conniving is introduced in subsection (3).  If it can be proven that that person knew, that person can also have proceedings taken against him or her.  I am a bit concerned that there is an unintended consequence of introducing a new layer here that might make it more difficult to achieve a prosecution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018032200002#E01800","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1521732600,"counter":2144,"content":"<p>I take on board what the Minister has said.

The Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, is the representative body for the country&rsquo;s 49 local development companies, LDCs, often referred to as partnership companies.  They are not-for-profit, multi-sectoral partnerships that deliver community and rural development, labour market activation, social inclusion and social enterprise services across the country.  Last year they supported more than 15,000 communities and community groups and 173,000 individuals by delivering approximately &euro;330 million worth of programmes on behalf of Departments and State agencies.  Examples include the social inclusion community activation programme, known as SICAP, employment supports, Leader, education, child care, public health and social enterprise programmes and supports.  The ILDN supports its member organisations through liaison with funders, research and policy development, publicity and communications, networking opportunities, advocacy and representation, training, group procurement such as insurance, Garda vetting, etc.<\/p> <p>  Specifically, in the context of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, local development companies deliver the following programmes on its behalf: the back-to-work enterprise allowance; T&uacute;s; the rural social scheme; the local employment service; jobs clubs; the community employment scheme and the jobs initiative.  Through these programmes, in 2016 we placed almost 9,000 people in employment and 5,772 in self-employment; supported 336 social enterprises to employ a further 4,808 people, and placed and supported almost 11,000 other individuals in T&uacute;s, rural social scheme, community employment scheme and jobs initiative programmes.  In addition to these outcomes, employment and training supports were provided for a further 20,000 individuals whose employment journey had not yet led to a job, including those experiencing multiple barriers to entering the labour market.  A further societal benefit is the several thousand communities and community groups, the daily lives of which are enhanced by the contributions of programme participants to their local areas.<\/p> <p>  The background to the formation of local development companies is that they were set up by the voluntary sector on the invitation of the State to link hard-to-reach communities and individuals with State services and programmes.  The relationship dates back almost a quarter of a century through all parts of the employment-unemployment cycle.  We continue to enjoy a fruitful, ongoing collaboration with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and other Departments, on behalf of which we deliver so many services.  Local development companies are community-led, bottom-up and not for profit in ethos.  Their boards comprise local, voluntary directors alongside public sector personnel and, in many cases, employers, union and elected representatives.  They link with local economic and community plans and local community development committees, usually known as LECPs and LCDCs, ensuring wide-ranging oversight and democratic accountability.  We make decisions and base our services close to where they have an impact, ensuring our links with employers, job seekers and communities are harnessed for maximum effect.  Because we operate multiple programmes in multiple sectors, our programmes do not compete with each other, but complementary supports can be offered to service users.  For example, they may use our training, job seeker, child care and health promotion services simultaneously.<\/p> <p>  These are some of the distinguishing features of local development companies, but it is important that we also give the committee and the wider public assurances as to the quality, effectiveness, governance and value for money we provide.  In that regard, let me make a few observations.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding performance, LDCs are evaluated and audited by a range of external bodies.  For instance, Pobal&rsquo;s rigorous monitoring of our delivery of SICAP shows a significant surpassing of the prescribed KPI targets which have been circulated for the information of members.  Included is the achievement, to a figure of 138%, of the progression to employment indicator, KPI1, for the latest year on record.  Therefore, we are not opposed to independent measurement and evaluation.  All of our programmes are subject to funder audit and inspection by local, national and EU statutory bodies and, in some cases, all three.  <\/p> <p> We still await publication of the Indecon report on the LES and jobs clubs, but in the meantime we can give some details of value-for-money aspects of the LES.  Using methodology employed by the UK Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion which the Department engaged during its cost modelling for JobPath, Mayo LES has returned a minimum of &euro;1.96 million to the Exchequer, while costing the latter &euro;871,000.  A three-year study at Ballymun LES found that a societal value of &euro;2.77 was generated for every &euro;1 invested.  While these statistics are a few years old, we would welcome the release of the Indecon report on the LES and jobs club as a contribution to the current discussion.  My comments are offered to demonstrate that LDCs are not seeking protected status, or a reduced level of oversight than the investment of public moneys deserves.  We do not fear competition, KPIs or detailed oversight, but we do have reservations about using a payment-per-results model for social programmes owing to the impact on participants.  Thus, we share the concerns raised at the committee on 25 January by Dr. Mary Murphy when she critiqued the impact of tendering and commissioning, as applied, saying it made operators \"compete with one another for the attention of recipients rather than figure out what the best service is for those recipients.\"  <\/p> <p>  The negative impact of the current model of competitive tendering on the beneficiary can be seen in the following ways.  First, competitive tenders for social programmes are inefficient as they distract from the core work being done.<\/p><p>In addition, in their 2017 report, Back to the Future: Reimaging the Role of the LES in 2020 Ireland, Dr. Mary Murphy and Ms Audrey Deane list the high transaction costs of contract design and bid preparation, management fees and profit margins of 15% to 20% as impacting on any claimed savings to the extent that such savings may not be realised.  Second, the current model limits the focus of the work to the narrow and specific terms of the contract being offered.  It prohibits the service from adapting to the inevitable changes in the operational environment over the duration of the contract.  In practical terms, a competition can only be run every three to six years, locking all parties into pricing and services that may be more appropriate to a different time.  Finally, it promotes payment by a narrow, usually quantitative interpretation of results which promotes cherry-picking and does not allow for deeper work.  Is 30 plus hours of work per week the only measure of success we should now allow for those who are most distant from the labour market?  That yardstick does not value the contribution of many employees and is potentially discriminatory.<\/p><p> Although we greatly welcome the recent and ongoing reductions in the live register, our services are generally not located in a world of averages.  We operate in communities of stubbornly high unemployment and with those most distant from the labour market even in areas where the live register is low.<\/p><p> The nature and scale of unemployment is never static.  The Department has outlined to the committee the necessity for it to be responsive to changing need.  We support that objective and offer the following observations on the current model of contracting, the rationale for which was outlined as follows by the Department at the committee meeting on 8 March: \"Contracting is considered to be the most appropriate approach to augmenting resource capacity to deliver services during a period of peak demand.\"  Crucially, however, this model, as it has been operated, has not facilitated flexibility and has only relatively recently been ramped up in a labour market that is very different from that in being in 2011 when the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, made its report on support and services for unemployed jobseekers that was used to justify current arrangements.  Contracted services under the pay-by-results model did not reach truly operational levels until 2016, at which stage there was annual spending of &euro;25 million.  The years 2017 and 2018 seem likely to be the most costly, with annual spending of over &euro;50 million at a time when we are told we are on the cusp of full employment.<\/p><p> In contrast, when local development companies, LDCs, were tasked with setting up T&uacute;s in 2011, a new scheme was initiated with 6,999 participants engaged by 2013.  In response to lower numbers on the live register, the Department is currently revising the T&uacute;s quota downwards as well as reducing the overall amount allocated to local development companies in service fees.  Another example is the flexibility of the local employment services, LES, network in taking on an additional 50,000 referrals for no extra fee in 2012.  There was no lock-in for the taxpayer in those two arrangements.  Where such lock-in exists in other contracts, it should not be seen in isolation as it inevitably impacts on programmes where quotas and referrals can be altered without contract breach, as is the case between the Department and local development companies.<\/p><p> The crucial point about the current arrangements is that the Department rightly wants to be able to respond and react to the changing profile of unemployment and underemployment.  Partnerships with not-for-profit local development companies are the most effective way to ensure that flexibility and responsiveness.  Such partnerships allow for changing terms within the life of a programme rather than a rigid enforcement of contract terms.  They further facilitate innovation and value for money as evidenced by new practices such as LES group engagement sessions and their work under the EU globalisation fund, all taken on without industrial relations, IR, issues or any additional funding to the companies.  That approach has served the State well and LDCs are willing and able to do more in partnership with our colleagues in the Department, with whom we work extremely well on the ground and on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p> The ILDN and its members wish to be part of a dynamic employment supports and activation framework that is person-centred, flexible and responsive as well as value for money.  We are available for increased roles in the design and delivery of new programmes and approaches with jobless households, people with disabilities, returning carers and new cohorts that may be unemployed or underemployed but are not visible on the live register.  There are current challenges for the companies with regard to their own sustainability and how they are funded to play their role, but we believe that these can be solved once a clearer framework on contracted services is put in place.<\/p><p> We welcome the committee&rsquo;s interest in our work and will take any questions that members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018032200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Bowe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521714600,"counter":2217,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance and opening statement.

Perhaps the troika had something to do with the decision.  One could understand the reaction to it.  There was a correlation between JobPath ramping up and referrals to our organisations in certain parts of the country falling dramatically.  It would have been helpful to have a more consistent level of referrals across the country.  We do not currently offer our services country wide but we could have expanded in that regard.  The partnership companies that do not run local employment services tried to provide that service in different ways and perhaps those resources could be enhanced to give us a national profile.  My area did not suffer from a lack of referrals but in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, for example, referrals to T&uacute;s from 2015 dropped from 722 to 261 while JobPath was ramping up and there was a similar fall in referrals to local employment services there.  Figures for last year indicate that local employment services were contracted for 20,050 referrals and received 15,900, which is a 20% failure in referrals.

The joint committee is examining JobPath and its impact on services and schemes such as those provided by local employment services.  I should point out that I was previously a board member of Bray Area Partnership and I am familiar with the critical work done by the various organisations across the State.  I had to vacate my position on the board when I was elected to the Oireachtas and, as such, no conflict of interest arises.<\/p> <p>  A couple of weeks ago, officials informed the joint committee that the Department needed to build capacity when unemployment was high.  As Mr. O'Neill made clear, the local employment services would have been able to ramp up their activities across the State to meet the increased capacity required by the Department.  Did the Department ask the local employment services at any point after 2011 whether they had the ability to ramp up their services?  Did any communication take place at any stage? <\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Neill noted that the number of places in the T&uacute;s scheme in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown declined from 722 to 261, which is a startling reduction.  I obtained figures via parliamentary questions on the number of referrals to local employment services across the State.  These show a decline across the board.  Mr. O'Neill indicated he would be able to provide the joint committee with figures from across the State.  It would be useful if he were to furnish us with statistics in respect of T&uacute;s, community employment and so forth. <\/p> <p>  We know the Department is locked into a contract with Turas Nua and Seetec until 2020 or 2021.  Are the witnesses fearful about the future of the schemes they operate?  While I am aware that referrals are a major concern, are there other issues that affect the schemes operated by the local employment services and, if so, will the witnesses elaborate on them?<\/p> <p>  People with disabilities face serious challenges in terms of gaining and maintaining employment.  Is there scope to increase provision for persons with disabilities on the schemes operated by the local employment services?  Various reports have shown that the proportion of people with disabilities at risk of consistent poverty is much higher in Ireland than in many other European Union member states.  It is also much higher than among other population groups. <\/p> <p>  I have spoken to a number of employees in various partnerships.  The ethos of the local development committees means they are not-for-profit, take a bottom-up approach and are community-led.  We are all aware of the tendering process in which the committees and partnerships must engage and the witnesses outlined the various difficulties they face in this regard.  Concerns have arisen that in the event of one of the local development companies being unsuccessful in its tender, it may not be in a position to meet its obligations in respect of employment rights; in other words, it would be unable to pay the cost of redundancies or notice periods because these organisations do not allocate funding to cater for such a scenario.  Has this concern been expressed by members of staff?  I have spoken to a number of people who detailed the extensive tendering process in which the local development committees must engage.  Some of the tenders have been ongoing since August or September 2017 and require a great deal of work.  The organisations do not know until the last day whether they are successful and some of the staff working in them for ten or 15 years do not know if redundancy payments will be made if the tender is unsuccessful.<\/p> <p>  Is there scope to allow people in receipt of qualified adult payments to engage with the schemes?  Many of those who receive the payment would like an opportunity to upskill.

At no stage were local development companies given the option to create a nationwide local employment scheme, LES, model and ramp up the LES to meet the requirements.  The Department engaged with us on increasing the number of clients coming to the LES under the existing model and we changed our model of engagement with clients in response to that.  However, we were not given the option of choosing to broaden and deepen the LES provision, as opposed to going to a pay-by-results private tender model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018032200002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521714600,"counter":2226,"content":"<p>There is a danger of being locked into figures and referrals.

While employment is the end result in the ideal scenario, the journey into the world of traditional employment can take months or years and sometimes it never ends.  For this reason, it is better not to get locked into the issue of figures.<\/p> <p>  The decline in the number of referrals means that theoretically staff have been freed up to spend more time with those who most need assistance, which is what we are there to provide.  We take the most difficult cases and in that regard, I would like to correct a certain comment that was made.  We do not have an issue with the quality of candidates and I do not like the use of that term.  We were established to respond to unemployed people who walk through our doors, regardless of their circumstances or the issues involved.

As Mr. Bowe said, our job is to work as closely as possible with those who are disadvantaged.  This brings me back to the point that was made about engagement with the qualified adult schemes.  We would look to do that.  The new ability programme funding that was released recently is very positive.  Some of our companies have supported local projects to go for that.

The need to examine carefully what we mean when we talk about flexibility and responsiveness has come across very strongly.  A hard contract that has been tied in over the long term, with one or two versions of success, is not necessarily the most flexible thing.  The point has been well made that it took from 2011 to 2015 for this to start to be put in place.  During the height of the unemployment crisis, we saw some very creative responses from local employment services and local development networks.<\/p> <p>  I should say for the purposes of transparency that I worked briefly in a support role as a consultant with Wexford Local Development on a project relating to youth unemployment in the south east.  It was a great experience for me.  It was inspiring to see the level of genuine care that was being provided to support and empower young people in an unemployment blackspot.  The idea of flexibility came across even in the small cohort I was supporting.  The route out for one person turned out to be opening a business, somebody else went back into education by going to college and another person who was an artist had to find a way to be an artist.  The kinds of roles that other people were looking for were more straightforward.  It was a case of overcoming issues of isolation and balancing issues of care.  The diverse needs of those in the small cohort I worked with meant that the right choices which had to be made to allow them to find a route forward were similarly diverse.<\/p> <p>  A one-size-fits-all recipe cannot be applied.  It was to the benefit of those involved that the multiple schemes which have been described were happening under one umbrella.  All kinds of other schemes, including T&uacute;s and local heritage development schemes, allowed for cross-pollination and facilitated a creative approach to finding the right response.  That is very important.  It comes back to the key point that Mr. O'Reilly made about design and delivery.  Part of what I was doing with these young people involved ensuring they became empowered not just to receive employment policy, but also to help to shape it.  During the time of the European youth guarantee, the young people with whom I was working were pushing for a rural youth guarantee pilot that would address some of the specific issues associated with rural unemployment and poverty among young people.  We still have not achieved such a pilot.  As my colleagues on the committee will be aware, I am continuing to push for it.  The agents in question were not just receiving policy - they were in a position to give feedback on what was and was not working and they were empowered to cultivate such a dynamic.  That is such a different level of work and case work.  It was certainly very inspiring to me.<\/p> <p>  I was very struck by what the witnesses said about flexibility and responsiveness.  The Government needs figures so that it knows who is needed and where unemployment is going up and down.  It is crucial that there is flexibility and responsiveness to the varying needs of clients.  I was struck by the references that were made to jobless houses, people with disabilities, returning carers and other new cohorts.  There needs to be a willingness to find flexible and appropriate responses.  I absolutely echo what has been said about the hidden unemployed, particularly qualified adults and those who are receiving the transitional jobseekers' payment.  We spoke about lone parents in a separate context.  Many activation supports are provided on a voluntary basis to those who receive the transitional jobseekers' payment.  This should be done on a voluntary basis for qualified adults as well.  The right supports to help such people are not always available.  There is a need to ensure there is a wide range of options, including solutions that do not always involve 30 or more hours.  In some cases, labour market activation should be built initially through part-time employment or education that is constructive.<\/p> <p>  It would be useful if the witnesses would expand on where they believe there is designed potential for new schemes and new ways of working.  I ask them to comment on some of the issues that have not been addressed, such as the idea of a youth guarantee pilot for young people in rural areas.  I would like to refer to the wider joined-up community development role of the Irish Local Development Network.  There was serious pressure on local development and community development partnerships during the recession.  The increasing focus on employment under the 80:10:10 rule meant that other aspects of community development, such as support for older people, for the very youngest or for youth clubs, were operating in a shrinking space of funding.  Is there any sense that funding is coming back into these complementary areas, which are not as disconnected as we might think?  People operate in families, etc.  It is totally inappropriate that funding is being pulled away from the partnerships in the employment area.  As this is happening, is there a corresponding return of funding into other areas?  How do they fit together from the network's perspective?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018032200002#G00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521714600,"counter":2230,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Neill will take the first question and Ms Kavanagh will take the second question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018032200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Bowe"},{"type":"speech","time":1521714600,"counter":2231,"content":"<p>Perfect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018032200002#G00500","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521714600,"counter":2232,"content":"<p>Reference has been made to the different schemes we are using.

It is a huge achievement to get somebody in a disadvantaged area who has responsibility for children into a part-time job.  It is not measured or accredited in any way.  We are not looking for money for it.  We are looking for recognition that a distance has been travelled in a very big way.  The same can be said of placements on T&uacute;s and community employment schemes.  We are dealing with people who could be said to have needed a pre-T&uacute;s scheme.  We are literally training people to attend at 9 o'clock every morning.  That in itself is part of the distance travelled model.  We need to be much more flexible than strict.  My personal view is that funding is not coming back into this area.  Funding is leaking out of the area at a rate of knots.  We are moving towards everything being based on the market and tendered for.  I know from my experience in the OECD that this is not what is happening throughout Europe.

Deputy Brady has received information on LES in replies to parliamentary questions and I have had some communications from the Department.  Together they give rise to a scenario where a central element of the rationale presented to the committee by departmental officials for JobPath is flatly contradicted.  To the question of whether the programme has affected referrals, the answer is indisputably \"Yes\".  According to what we were told at our most recent meeting, it is as if two different organisations were dealing with two different sets of the population and there was no conflict whatsoever.  That is a matter of concern because the committee's role is to ensure the money spent on social protection is properly spent and we are getting value for money.

It is a difficult one to answer.  We have to act on our own beliefs.  The service was set up 25 years ago to respond to particular problems and the challenge of the Government was to be flexible.  It was a time when the long-term unemployment figures were a lot higher.  As we get to the magical figure of 4%, there is still a cohort with whom we should do something and about whom we should not forget.  We can look at the schemes which are working, but there has to be a group which will work specifically with that cohort.  Ours is the correct vehicle.  Assuming we are doing our job well and are under scrutiny and answerable, it offers the best template to provide a wrap-around service.  There are others who can deal with the short-term unemployed and address the peaks and valleys.  I am trying not to get into problems while answering a question about a contractual issue.

An orderly discussion is taking place behind the scenes to try to reach what might be a difficult exit strategy.  If it is done in the right way, at a governance level, it can be managed, albeit that it may be difficult at the end.  The lesson is that some of these schemes and programmes go up and down and the exit strategy should be prepared as part of the contract discussions so that when the inevitable downsizing occurs there is a plan in place for it and there is not chaos.  It is difficult enough when one is coming to the end of a scheme but it is better to plan for the exit and be ready, rather than leaving it to the end when there is chaos.  One ends up wasting a great deal of everyone's time.  I compliment the part of the Department that is looking after T&uacute;s which is trying to manage a reduction in an orderly way.

If one looked at it purely in terms of a cost-benefit analysis, the reduction in that scheme might not be warranted.  That is a question that needs to be asked.  I know there are problems with the use of the term \"full employment\", but as we approach full employment, it does not mean that reducing the size of some of those schemes is the correct decision.  Their structures may need to be changed or the duration may need to be longer.  When T&uacute;s was introduced in 2011 unemployment was going through the roof and a one-year turnaround was aimed at getting people back into work.  Over the years, all those schemes have been modified and varied to reflect the economic situation of the day.  The example was given about T&uacute;s being resized or whatever.  Maybe it should not be resized but instead remodelled to meet a different need.

I will put some flesh on the bones on the matter of community benefits which the Chair raised.  A T&uacute;s quota of approximately 8,000 and a rural social scheme, RSS, quota of around 3,000 represents several thousand community groups that have real people allocated to provide services to them.  The people are allocated to the community sector not to the private sector.  Any tinkering with or adjustment of the quotas has implications beyond the narrow activation needs of the individuals accessing the community services.  Particularly from a rural perspective, and 35 of our members are rural companies, and the challenges they face in sustaining viable communities, these schemes play a very central role which must be taken into account.<\/p> <p>  Senator Higgins asked about the design phase of programmes prior to the delivery phase.  It is worth bearing in mind that local development companies came out of an experimentation background.  Several of our programmes are embedded and are part of life.  However, what we did especially well was to respond to a call that acknowledged that nobody had all the answers to a particular problem but we need to try to pilot.  Maybe we have been somewhat afraid to pilot in recent years.  Now that we are at the cusp of what one might call full employment, there are difficult cohorts, new phases or a certain intractability in some areas, as has been acknowledged here, and nobody has the answers.  We are open for that experimentation phase.  Given that we are close to those communities and those sectors in communities, we are well placed for piloting and that element of the work outside of delivery, also needs to be taken on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018032200002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Saunders"},{"type":"speech","time":1521714600,"counter":2270,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bowe and his colleagues for attending today.
