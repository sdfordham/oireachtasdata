I understand a report was completed, at least in draft form, and sent to the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  It then had to be legally proofed.  I do not know whether changes have become necessary as a result of communications between the legal representatives of the HEA and the author of the report which was submitted to the HEA in November 2017.  With April approaching, I am informed that it could be several months before the report is published.  I am concerned by the length of time it is taking to publish it.  As someone who received at least 14 protected disclosures about some of the issues addressed in the report, I am aware that its author met dozens of people in Waterford Institute of Technology.  Complications may have arisen because the report may make adverse references to persons other than those who made disclosures, provided information or were interviewed.  However, I do not know if that is the case because we have not had sight of the draft report.<\/p> <p>  I am also aware that at one point the Comptroller and Auditor General was considering whether to produce a report on the FeedHenry aspect of the issue.

I believed that if we had something additional to add, we could then make a decision, but, given the time, it is probably better that we press ahead with the report.

Item No. 1144C, correspondence received from Deputy Marc MacSharry, refers to this correspondence.  The individual in question is calling for four things: first, that we critically review his latest correspondence; second, that we request cumulative officially reported expenditure on the subject of litigation in 2017; third, that we confirm that the Comptroller and Auditor General's branch, in all relevant years, namely, from 2007 to 2017, inclusive, tested under the money-laundering legislation, as applicable, in the case of St. Angela's College and, if not, that such testing be undertaken, as appropriate, this being a matter for Mr. McCarthy; and, fourth, that we recommend that an audit of corporate governance and management be undertaken by St. Angela's College Sligo Limited.

The individual has forwarded a number of solicitors' letters in which a number of allegations are made.  If he believes the allegations, he should pursue the matter further through the courts.  If he believes there are criminal actions, he should report them to the Garda.  That is not our function.  For our part and with his agreement, I propose that we forward the correspondence to the HEA for whatever action it deems appropriate.  Beyond that, I suggest we do not involve ourselves further.  We are not asking the HEA to do anything; we are forwarding the material to it for its attention for any action it chooses to take.  We can also expect every attempt to be made by public bodies to reduce expenditure on litigation.  The individual in question has asked for details of expenditure on legal fees in 2017.  I propose that we do not go there.  He can take up the matter through whatever other channels are available.  It is essentially a legal dispute and we are not going to get into it any further.  I have made the committee's view clear.  We will forward the material to the HEA.  The individual in question has the option of going to the courts.  It is a legal dispute that has been in the courts before.  If there are criminal matters involved, the individual in question has the option of going to the Garda, but the Committee of Public Accounts is not the appropriate body to take the matter further.  We are concluding our correspondence on the issue on that basis.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item No. 1139C  is correspondence received from Professor Patrick O'Shea, president, University College Cork, enclosing information requested by the committee on the appointment process for the chief operations officer in the Tyndall National Institute.  Can we note the correspondence and forward a copy to the individual who raised the matter?  It is an employment matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item No. 1148C  is correspondence received from Deputy Niamh Smyth.  It concerns the issue of corporate governance at Creative Ireland and the allocation of funding for various events and festivals.  I propose, in the first instance, that we write to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for a response which we will discuss when we receive it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item No. 1149C  is correspondence received from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, enclosing information requested by the committee on the Irish Horse Welfare Trust, an organisation which is based in County Wicklow.  Can we note the item and forward a copy to the individual who raised the matter?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item No. 1158C is correspondence received from an individual who alleges the unlimited waste of taxpayers' money to harass her family.  She has copied correspondence to the committee and been in touch with the health committee.  The substantive matter seems to relate to the taking into custody by the Garda of her children on two occasions, in 2013 and 2016, as a result of a court order.  It is not within the remit of the committee to consider court decisions.  I propose that we write to the individual in question to suggest she consider obtaining legal advice on her options.  I also propose that we write to state our consideration of the matter is now closed.  We certainly cannot revisit matters dealt with in the Family Court.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item No. 1159C  is correspondence received from an individual concerning what he describes as the SIPTU-F&Aacute;S slush fund.  He questions why the committee is not investigating the matter which has been ongoing for five or six years at the committee.  It was considered by the previous committee.  There is also an ongoing investigation into the alleged misappropriation of grant funds and the issue remains within the remit of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  The last committee submitted the matter to the Garda to investigate whether there was fraud involved.  This was communicated to the individual in question last November.  I propose that we write to him to state we do not propose to pursue the matter further and that he not circulate further correspondence on it to the committee.  If at some point the investigation is concluded by the Garda and there are matters arising from it that are relevant to the committee, we may return to the issue at that stage.  It has been handed over to the Garda and we are not getting involved at this stage.  Is that agreed?

The findings of the Console report, which we might discuss in the work programme, were so bad that the report itself said that it pointed to potentially systemic problems within the HSE, that they were not just with the funded organisations but also in the relationship between those organisations and the HSE.  That was not accepted by the director general, yet almost monthly we seem to have problems with funding in these organisations.  This is serious because there is a potential conflict of interest.  The report itself cites that issue.  There are also questions around credit card expenditure.  This has all come about on foot of an internal audit by the HSE.  Is that audit public?  Has it been published yet?  If not, can we have a copy of it?  My understanding is that St. John of God may also have been dealt with and that it was not just the hospice in Harold's Cross.  There were other issues as well.<\/p><p> It is unfortunate that we are back here again.  While we have dealt with this issue, it does not seem that controls have improved to any great degree.

We will come back to it in the work programme.<\/p><p> How many times do we have to be here?  People are very rarely held to account.  The Accounting Officer from the HSE will tell us that the problems are all on the side of the funded organisations.  In fact, the internal auditors of the HSE were in disagreement with the director general in terms of whether there were systemic issues for the HSE.  We have to deal with this once and for all because there is obviously a need to sharpen up governance arrangements.

Nothing will happen and everybody walks away freely without consequence.  This has happened with the Garda matters we looked at among others matters.  The lack of answers forthcoming and the lack of candour that we have seen demonstrates that this committee, which is the only constitutional committee of the State, can be treated with disdain and contempt without fear or favour.  The CEOs of State agencies need have no concerns about how money is spent or how things are done.  They will come to this committee and any issues will be noted on the audit report but there will be no net outcome.  The same thing then happens a couple of years later and we are here again.

While it may seem that there has not been much reaction, I certainly feel that a better effort is being made by the HSE to get on top of the oversight issue.  Earlier I mentioned the tightening of controls as a result of the committee's consideration of the levy fund.  The complete effect of that tightening up has not worked its way through the system for the time period that the internal audit was looking at.  One of the things we have been pushing with the HSE is for it to acknowledge that there are problems and to outline the steps it is taking.  Each year in the statement on internal financial control it has acknowledged that weaknesses have been brought to its attention by my office and by its own internal audit and that it is making better efforts.  It still has things to fix and it will take more time to achieve tighter control in that area, but I do believe that it is happening, that the HSE has engaged with the matter and that it is trying to deal with it at a systemic level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I am not convinced that the HSE has faced up to all of its responsibilities here, but to be fair, if Mr. McCarthy has noticed from his perspective a shift in terms of better governance and better oversight, that is good.

If it were to be published, it would have to be legally prepared and tested in case anybody wanted to contest an issue.  It is essentially an internal matter.  To publish something that was produced only to a standard for internal circulation would be a different issue for the HSE.  The HSE has never published its internal audit report because it would have to proof every internal audit report legally and it would lead to different issues.  In terms of the Console audit report, we all received copies of it here and discussed it at length.  Neither the HSE nor this committee published it.  It was widely circulated in the media but we did not publish it because there was obviously some quite strong issues therein which might have led to legal issues.

From recollection of our exchange with the director general, however, section 39 organisations might receive only 5% of their funding from the HSE, for example.  The valid point was made that we do not want to create too much red tape for small organisations that might not have the expertise to deal with higher levels of oversight.  However, a section 38 organisation is a horse of a different colour and there must be far higher levels of oversight of such organisations.

I am not going to accept this.  We have been down the road on this a number of times.  I raised another issue in respect of the Cork Opera House, which they are now funding under own funded sources or whatever phrase they use.<\/p> <p>  The issue here is that there is an extra pension liability as a result of legal challenges to decisions that were made by the college.  As a consequence, that has to be met by the university and paid for proportionately out of that whole pie of funding by the taxpayer.  That is the bottom line here.  We need to get to the bottom of why we ended up in this scenario on these pensions from this university.  What professional decisions were made on employment that resulted in people getting their legal entitlements - I have no issues with that - ending up in court and winning?<\/p> <p>  Ultimately it is the taxpayer who pays.  I do not buy any of this rubbish about non-taxpayer funded sources.  They should be banned, in my opinion.  It all goes into one pot.  The total taxpayer-related funding could be 60%, 70% or whatever.  Whatever the net cost to the taxpayer of an issue like this because of decisions they made, it is proportionately being paid in that amount by the taxpayer in the first place.  We need to ask questions about this and dig into it.  The taxpayer is ultimately funding the majority of this bill.  It is not non-taxpayer related funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#H02300","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>From an accounting perspective, I can fully understand how one would and could label it as non-Exchequer funding sources.  From a financial or accounting perspective, that is fine.  We know there are multiple income streams, separate from State funding, for institutes of technologies and more so for universities.  The difficulty, as Teachta Kelly said, is that there is an added liability to this being met by the institution.  Even if we take the line that it is coming from non-Exchequer funding sources, that means the money is not being spent on other services.  It is sleight of hand in some respects.  It is still money that is spent by an institution that is primarily funded by the taxpayer.  Contributions from parents and students have also increased substantially in recent years.  Any added liability as a consequence of actions taken would obviously raise concerns for us and for those who pay the fees.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General might be able to help me unpack some of the language.  The document states, \"This treatment is not in accordance with the requirements of FRS 102 Section 21 [whatever that is] 'Provisions and Contingencies' because the receivable is contingent in nature.\"  Will Mr. McCarthy explain to us what that means in layman's terms?  The document also refers to \"the non-consolidation of Cork University Foundation DAC, which had accumulated reserves of &euro;4.1 million\".  Teachta Connolly has raised issues about foundations before.  Is that a qualified opinion because the consolidation did not happen as quickly as it should have?  Is that what the issue is?<\/p> <p>  Reading the final reference in this section of the document, here we go again with procurement.  Going back to the point made by Teachta MacSharry on procurement, there is no sanction or penalty.  We have said this over and over again.  It is becoming really frustrating.  What is the point in having all of these accounts presented to us?  Almost every week, there is some public body that does not follow procurement guidelines.  Notwithstanding whether they are watching their backs in terms of being sued or if there is a party that did not get the contract that might sue them, that is separate in my view.

We are joined from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform by Mr. Robert Watt and Mr. Brendan Ellison; from the National Development Finance Agency by Mr. Gerard Cahillane, Mr. Paul O'Neill and Mr. Sean Court; from the Department of Education and Skills by Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Ms Emma Leonard and Mr. Gary O'Doherty; and from Transport Infrastructure Ireland by Mr. Michael Nolan, Mr. Nigel O'Neill and Mr. Michael Kennedy.<\/p><p>We have picked Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the Department of Education and Skills as two of the key State bodies involved in PPPs.  Other Departments are involved in PPPs, but we could not bring everybody in and considered these to be two of the key bodies involved, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and especially the National Development Finance Agency which is heavily involved in the entire process.<\/p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to airplane mode.

PPPs may take a number of forms, reflecting the manner in which investment project risks are shared between the public and private partners and the manner in which the private sector partners are remunerated for their input.  In many cases, the public sector partner pays the private sector partner for the provision of the assets or services in the form of regular agreed unitary payments over the life of the contract.  In other cases, including tolled roads, the private sector partner is remunerated through payments by service users or a combination of user charges and State payments.<\/p> <p>  The report before the committee aims to provide an overview, to mid-2017, of PPP-related payments and commitments made by central government agencies arising from contracts entered into in the past two decades and further projects in development.  Members should note that the report does not deal with PPP commitments entered into by local authorities, for example, in respect of the Poolbeg waste incineration facility or the areas of water and wastewater treatment facilities, responsibility for which has transferred to Irish Water.<\/p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform maintains a central website providing details of the Exchequer-funded payments under public private partnership, PPP, arrangements.  This indicates that as of end-2016, projects already entered into involve Exchequer payments totalling an estimated &euro;9.6 billion, with just over &euro;3 billion already incurred and an estimated &euro;6.6 billion in outstanding commitments.  This compares to total Exchequer payments and commitments on PPP projects at end 2012 estimated at &euro;6.1 billion.<\/p><p> In figure 4.1, the report outlines the status as at July 2017 of a programme of 12 major PPP projects in train or announced in July 2012.  Three of the projects have not progressed as PPPs.  Of the remainder, two were operational by July 2017, six were in construction and one was still in procurement.  Two further projects announced after 2012 - a social housing bundle and a second motorway services area bundle - had commenced procurement by July 2017, and a number of others were in development at that time.  Payments under Exchequer-backed PPP arrangements in 2016 amounted to &euro;225 million.  We noted that the infrastructure and capital investment plan 2016 to 2021 had indicated that a cash limit had been placed on the annual cost of PPPs.  The Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be able to update the committee in that regard.<\/p><p> The Department&rsquo;s public spending code requires that, before a State body commits to a major capital project, it should assess whether there is a clear socio-economic case for the infrastructure or service.  If such a case can be made, a follow-on exercise is required to establish whether it is more cost effective to procure the proposed investment via a PPP structure or to use a more conventional procurement approach.  This value for money testing of the procurement method is done by comparing the projected Exchequer net cost under the PPP approach with the estimated benchmark net cost of delivering the project using conventional procurement.  Responsibility for ensuring the value for money testing is done rests with the sponsoring Department or agency, and the National Development Finance Agency assists public sector bodies with this analysis as required.<\/p><p> Public bodies are also required to carry out look-back evaluations of PPP projects when they are up and running for a reasonable time, indicating how the outturn compares to the original project proposed, and what useful lessons can be learned for improving succeeding projects, including those procured conventionally.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland does this routinely, and the Courts Service reviewed the Central Criminal Court's PPP.  At the reporting date, however, the Department of Education and Skills had not carried out any look-back reviews, even though it has many PPPs in place.  I have previously reported that very little information is made publicly available about PPP pre or post contract with regard to value for money evaluation results.  Publication of the evaluations, or at least summaries of key evaluation assumptions and findings, should help to improve public understanding of the factors that influence the achievement of good value for the public money spent on PPPs.<\/p><p> Contract monitoring and enforcement are key to ensuring good value is delivered through PPPs.  Penalties provided for in contracts have been applied in some cases where service performance and availability of facilities have not met specified standards.  Periodic benchmarking and market testing of service costs have also been carried out in a number of cases but these have generally not resulted in significant changes in costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General.

We welcome the report and its recommendation.<br\/><br\/>The primary role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in PPPs is to facilitate the PPP process centrally by developing the general policy framework and the capital investment policy framework, within which the PPP operates.  The new national development plan, launched by the Government recently, is the new framework within which we consider these matters.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also facilitates the PPP process by providing central guidance to Departments and other State authorities in that context.  Responsibility for individual PPP and concession projects rests with the relevant sponsoring Department or agency, where appropriate.  This includes financial responsibility and responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the public spending code and the overall PPP guidance set out by our Department.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform publishes a full suite of guidance to facilitate the PPP process, which is available on the central PPP unit's website at <i>www.ppp.gov.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>To ensure that Departments obtain the best value-for-money from public capital investment, PPPs are subject to the same robust and rigorous project appraisal process as applies to traditionally procured projects.  All projects over &euro;20 million are required under the public spending code to be subject to a cost benefit analysis or cost effectiveness analysis.  In addition, the public spending code also requires that the sponsoring agency seeks the advice of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, on all projects above &euro;20 million, in terms of the optimum means of financing the project on a value for money basis, to assess whether traditional or PPP methods of procurement are the best way to ensure value for money and to deliver the project for the taxpayers and citizens.  The public spending code also provides that the options should be considered by the sponsoring agency as part of the project appraisal.<br\/><br\/>The public spending code requirements ensure that all PPPs are subject to specific value for money tests at four stages during the procurement process.  There are particular requirements in respect of PPP projects.<br\/><br\/>Following completion of the project, all PPPs are subject to the public spending code requirement that a post project review be carried out, once sufficient time has elapsed to allow the project to be properly evaluated with sufficient evidence of the flows of benefits and costs from the project.  There should be two separate focuses of such a review - project outturn and the appraisal and management procedures.  These may be undertaken at the same time or at different stages, but they should be done as soon as is practicable.  In the case of PPP projects, once contract close has been reached, the cost of the project to the sponsoring agency is essentially set for the duration of the contract.  It is, therefore, possible for an element of the post project review to be undertaken on a provisional basis at that stage.  A final, definitive post-project review for PPP projects will effectively only be possible at the completion of the contract when the asset is handed back to the sponsoring agency and all costs arising under the PPP contract are definitively known.  This is normally after 20 or 25 years, which is the normal period over which these contracts are set.  An interim review conducted mid-way through the life of the contract could provide a useful indication of the likely final outcome at hand-back.<br\/><br\/>Post-project reviews are not the only mechanism for reviewing past experience in order to draw lessons which can be applied in the future.  The NDFA is the financial adviser on all PPPs and procures all accommodation projects on behalf of the sponsoring Departments.  Experience gained on each project procured helps inform the procurement of each subsequent project.  The NDFA also carries out an in-house lessons learned exercise following all PPP procurements.  This enables them to see what improvements can be made in processes and procedures.  This has resulted in a number of changes in the way PPPs are procured over the years.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform chairs a PPP steering group, which meets regularly to review progress across all PPPs in planning, procurement and operation.  This group provides a forum for the sharing of information and experience in the planning and delivery of PPPs, so that lessons learned on one project or in one area can be applied across the entire PPP programme.<br\/><br\/>The committee will also be aware that there have been two recent reviews of PPP policy in Ireland.  One review was part of the public investment management assessment, PIMA, of Ireland undertaken by the IMF in July of last year at the invitation of the Department of Finance.  We asked the IMF to review of capital planning and appraisal, including PPPs.  The second PPP review was undertaken by an inter-Departmental and agency group, which was established in 2017 to review Ireland's experience of PPPs and to make recommendations on the future role of PPPs in the context of the Government&rsquo;s new ten year national development plan.  The PIMA report categorised the institutional strength of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Is that completed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#L00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>The review is completed and is with the Minister.  Aspects of it were referenced in the national development plan.  I would be happy to give a broad outline of where we are but the Government has not approved it yet.  This will happen shortly, at which time it will be published in its entirety.<\/p> <p>  The PIMA report characterised the institutional strength of the PPP management framework as good, and its effectiveness as medium.  The IMF made a small number of recommendations to further strengthen the process and procedures already in place.  The PIMA report was published last November and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p> The report of the PPP review is with the Minister, who intends to bring the report to Government in the coming weeks for approval to publish.  However, the key findings and recommendations agreed were included in the NDP published in February.  These can be summarised as follows.<\/p><p> The review concluded that PPPs have been very useful in the past in facilitating the delivery of important infrastructure projects.  This was particularly the case when the Exchequer was seriously constrained in its ability to fund infrastructure directly during the fiscal crisis.  It was noted that this enabled projects to proceed which would not otherwise have been deliverable on the basis of the Exchequer funding available at that time alone.  However, under more normal economic and fiscal circumstances, the ability to use PPPs to deliver \"additionality\" in that context is now less relevant.  The NDP sets out the Government's plans to increase public capital investment to among the highest levels in the EU and sustain it at that level over the period to 2027.  In this context, the pursuit of further additional investment projects by PPP, over and above the planned NDP level of investment, is not recommended.  To do so would pose a risk that such projects could give rise to a level of public capital investment overall that is not consistent with macroeconomic or fiscal sustainability.  The PPP review therefore recommends that PPPs should continue to feature as a procurement option available to Government for appropriately structured projects which demonstrate value for money over a traditional procurement option and which meet the robust and rigorous tests for project appraisal that apply to all public investment projects under the public spending code.  However, projects to be pursued in this way by PPP should be progressed as part of the NDP, as opposed to additional projects.  This is consistent with the PIMA recommendations.  Accordingly, decisions on pursuing further PPPs will be taken on a case-by-case basis based on the merits of using PPP in the case of each individual project.<\/p><p> The PPP review recommended two other changes, the first of which was the discontinuation of the budgetary control mechanism limiting exposure to PPPs to 10% of the aggregate Exchequer capital allocation on an annual basis.  In effect, this was the approach we introduced a number of years ago which meant that unitary payments in any year could not be more than 10% of the Exchequer capital cost.  Therefore, if the overall Exchequer programme was &euro;5 billion, the unitary payments on PPPs could not exceed more than &euro;500 million on an annual basis.  The review recommended reinstating the previous budgetary control mechanism of charging the capital value of PPPs to the capital allocation of the sponsoring Department over the construction period.  This will ensure that PPPs and traditionally procured projects are treated equally in the selection of the most appropriate procurement mechanism for each individual project.  This approach was also recommended by the IMF in the PIMA report.  This is a significant recommendation which in effect ensures that Departments face the same incentives when they are choosing between a PPP project or an Exchequer-funded project because the capital cost of the PPP would be notionally charged to their accounts as if it were procured traditionally.  This means, regarding the accounting treatment, that there is no bias one way or the other in respect of the selection of projects.  This is a fundamental change which will impact how we select, approve and develop this programme into the future.  In addition, in order to improve transparency in reporting on PPPs, a number of changes in the reporting arrangements have also been recommended and will be introduced.  These involve publishing cost-benefit analyses, CBAs, and public sector benchmark reports and in effect making available the information that is used to make decisions to make that information available publicly.<\/p><p> I hope I have given the committee an understanding of the role of our Department in respect of PPP, some assurance regarding the guidance and procedures which are in place to ensure PPPs are used to provide a value-for-money option for the State, and an update on some of the key policy developments in this area.

I ask the committee to think about the building of a school.  Let us say the school costs &euro;5 million.  Traditionally, one would take two or three years to build the school and the cost would be charged to the Exchequer in the normal way.  This is the normal appropriation with which members would be familiar.  It is a standard, traditional approach.  It is how most schools, for example, are procured.  PPPs involve a contract whereby we enter into an agreement for 20 or 25 years.  The private sector builds, as it would in the case of traditional appropriation, but under design-build-operate-finance, DBOF, it would also provide the finance and would enter into an agreement to sustain, maintain and hand back the school after 25 years.  There is therefore a difference between this type of contract and the way in which we traditionally procure.  The unitary payments then would be made over 20 or 25 years.  That would be the standard.  These unitary payments would be a charge on the Exchequer each year over the period of the contract.  The unitary payment in effect would cover the capital cost, the financing cost and the operating and maintenance costs of the project.  That is the commonest standard form.<\/p> <p>  Road projects are a combination of concessions whereby tolling is involved as well, so there is a combination of user charges and unitary payments.  This is a little more complex, but in effect we enter into an agreement whereby company X would build a motorway and there would be a concession.  Some of the projects could be tolled, and the toll could meet a significant part of the payment.  Then there could be issues regarding guarantees.  Our colleagues from Transport Infrastructure Ireland can talk in more detail about some of these contracts.  They are quite complex.  Again, they are a subset of PPPs which are different.  Outside of tolling, the main one would be a DBOF, which is as I have described.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Are there any design-build-operate-maintain contracts without finance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#M00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Yes.

It is very difficult to make a comparison between a PPP project, which sets out the financing cost, the maintenance and so on, against a traditionally procured approach where the maintenance cost or something like that is a budgetary over time.

They are more complex and more involved, and there are different stages in the process.  There is the procurement, the financial close area and so on.  It is probably fair to say it is more complex, and that complexity can lead to more risks.  As the Deputy will have seen from the papers, we have in place a very detailed approach to assessing, valuating and procuring to ensure we are minimising that risk and getting value for money for the Exchequer, but there is no doubt these can be incredibly involved and, with complexity, can become more risky.  The key challenge for us is to ensure the risk is transferred to the private sector.  That is part of the reason we pay higher financing costs.  For example, the risk of maintaining the school over 25 years is with the private contractor.  With traditional procurement, we build a school and then the school principal and board of management, with the support of the Department, is responsible for maintaining it so in terms of the risk on us to maintain that school, within a PPP that risk is transferred and they have to hand over the school in good condition after 25 years or there are penalties incurred.  That risk transfer piece is the key issue for us.  In terms of the higher costs we pay and whether we are getting the benefit of those risk transfers, that comes down to a judgment, and it can be difficult at times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#O01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>That judgment can be very difficult when we are talking about risk transfer and traffic guarantee payments.

It was completed in October 2012 and the complex had opened around 2009.  The stated overall aim of the review was to determine whether any stage of the courts project could have been done better, with any lessons applied to future projects.  The review approach concentrated on assessing the processes used rather than the outcome of the project in terms of impact on court business.  At an overall level, the review concluded that the project objectives had been realised within a timeframe appropriate for a PPP project of its complexity.  It concluded that the project processes had been satisfactory.  The review suggested that further analysis should be carried out to assess the operational impacts resulting from the delivery of the project.<\/p> <p>  In terms of learning lessons, the review included recommendations for the PPP process and some of the recommendations were specific to the project; others had more general application.  These indicated that future projects should report against a benefits realisation plan and strategy and an issues log should be produced and maintained to record details of key decisions in a single document.  It is important to distinguish between a process review, or seeing how procurement worked and whether it could be streamlined, and whether the value proposal or business case was realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":420,"content":"<p>It was a partial review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P02800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":421,"content":"<p>It was a process review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":422,"content":"<p>It was a limited review but lessons could still be learned regarding the process for future PPPs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":423,"content":"<p>It was not a cost-benefit review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":424,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>We have not any post-project review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>We are back to zero.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03400","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>The reviews done by Transport Infrastructure Ireland will look at the realisation of benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>As I stated earlier, we have done ten post-project reviews.

One of the big lessons we learned was that forecasting traffic in a toll demand scenario was very difficult.  As Deputy Burke mentioned, there was significant risk and much of it was carried by the private sector.  There are two schemes with a floor on the exposure of the private sector but it means they are hovering at a low level in terms of where they thought they might be with traffic.  For the other six toll concession schemes out there, they carried all the risk.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, the reviews we undertook were for the procurement and statutory approval processes, as well as how it was done and the out-turn and timing of processes.  In a number of cases, it was recommended, given that traffic had not been as expected, that additional cost-benefit analyses should be done.  These were done in two cases and there is another we ought to do.  We will do that.  In all cases, it found that processes were satisfactory and the decision to procure via PPP was correct.  The cost-benefit outturns proved that the roads continued to represent value for money for the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":429,"content":"<p>We have to take the witness's word for that because we have not seen the reports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":430,"content":"<p>We will publish them and the committee will see the final document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Is there a timescale for the publication?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P03900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>If we had two or three months we could give the committee perfect documents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#P04000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>We must wait and see.

We accept the merit of the argument and we are in favour of having a much more transparent and open approach to these matters in order that Deputies, on behalf of the citizens, can establish that these projects represent value for money.

What Mr. Watt seems to miss is that we have not got the information which we need.  Yes, we can welcome that he has now come to the view that the post-project reviews should be published but we are here today to ask questions.  The meeting is today, not next month, in three months' time or next year, whenever these reports are eventually published.  It is today and we do not have the reviews.  Our job is to examine and to probe.  One of the observations from the Comptroller and Auditor General, in his opening remarks and in his report, is that there is a lack of public scrutiny, public debate and public accountability in the whole area of PPPs.  I would not imagine that the Comptroller and Auditor General was talking about the political sphere alone, but also about academics and other outside organisations, which would also look at this area because reports are not published.  Let us be honest, some of these reports go back 16 years.  It has been 16 years and only one has been published.  That is why we are frustrated and if that upsets any of the officials here, so be it.  We have a job to do and we are to do it today, not tomorrow, next month, in six months or in a year.

I accept what the Comptroller and Auditor General said when he gave the context.  If I am reading this right, and I want to be fair to everybody, there was opposition from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the past to publishing the post-project reviews.  We then had an analysis, review or examination by the International Monetary Fund.  It carried out a review and people would have been consulted.  On the back of that there was a change of heart.  A different position was adopted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is now open to publishing these post-project reviews.  That does not excuse the matter or answer the question as to why they were not carried out at all in one of the key Departments, namely, the Department of Education and Skills.  I do not believe that Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has given a satisfactory answer as to why not a single post-project review has been carried out.  This goes right to the heart of public accountability.  How can we evaluate whether there was good use of taxpayers' money, whether benchmarks which were set were met, whether there were any legal issues or impediments, or whether we got value for money?  None of this can be evaluated by this committee because Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and his Department have not carried out any post-project reviews.  Will he take me through that again in layman's terms?

The concept of a post-project review is a mid-term concept.  Our first completion was in 2002 and we are now 16 years on from that out of 25.  We focused on that.  We have undertaken a number of value for money tests.  We were the first Department to publish post-project public service benchmark, PSB, information.  We have also now made available to the committee the three PSBs for the first three schools bundles that had PSBs.  We are now publishing PSBs, as a policy, five years after so that commercial sensitivity is protected.  We have been very open with regard to being innovative in publishing information about PSBs and in publishing PSBs.  Analysis of those PSBs can be undertaken.  We saw the post-project review process as a mid-term review process.  We sought to do it a small number of years ago but we realised that we needed an intensity of engagement with it such that, given the pressures that we had to deliver school places, we had to prioritise school places.  School place delivery was prioritised over the last five or six years in a major way as we faced this demographic bulge.

I will try to calm things down a bit.  It is probably the first time I have attempted to do that at this forum.  Transparency is part of the issue with which we are dealing.  To be fair to the witnesses, some of the things we are analysing here predate their appointment to their current positions.  The economic circumstances in this country have gone all over the place since many of these PPPs were signed.  A great deal of decision-making needs to be contextualised.  It should also be remembered that political pressure on decision-making does not help sometimes.  There is some frustration about the process of getting information out there.  I accept that commitments have been given by the Secretary General in the context of writing to Departments.  I am sure everyone will get the information out there.  That will be co-ordinated.  We will take that at face value.<\/p> <p>  I have some valuable and useful information about the change in the PPP review and the mechanism for limiting exposure to PPPs to 10% of aggregate Exchequer value.  I think there is a need for a peer-to-peer review of PPP projects that compares such projects with directly-funded projects.  I agree that Exchequer-funded projects do not represent value for money.  This is not always evident, however, when such projects are subjected to line-by-line comparisons with PPP projects.  When value is being assessed, consideration must be given to whether something was a priority for spending in the first instance.  At a future date, I will, along with TII officials, review the analyses and algorithms used when decisions were made on some of the projects that were selected for inclusion in the 2040 plan, with a particular focus on those which may or may not have changed in the weeks before the launch.<\/p> <p>  We certainly need to conduct a peer-to-peer examination that compares Exchequer-funded projects and PPP projects.  There needs to be a breakdown by sector within that equation.  There is no one present from the Department of Health, but I would like to mention as an example the bundles that were drawn up for PPP primary care centres.  When I see the centres that are progressing, including the one in Carrick-on-Suir in my constituency, I look at the other options which have been set out in competitions for the construction of primary care centres.  Some of those who win contracts essentially flip them by selling them on.  It is speculation, basically.  Again, there is exposure here.  When we are doing comparisons, we should think about getting down to the unit basis.  It would be helpful if we were to look not just at roads, but also at the decisions made within that realm.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus on a couple of direct issues.  I had the pleasure of travelling through the Limerick tunnel going to and from a certain match last weekend.  I would like to go through the costs relating to this famous road, as set out on pages 67 and 68 of the report.<\/p><p>I am particularly interested in the total exposure as regards the traffic risk sharing component on pages 67 and 68 of the report.  I want to get into the real figures, if possible.  These questions are for TII.  No. 2 is a design, build, operate, fund and maintain, DBOFM, classification and the total project cost is &euro;281 million.  Note F reads: \"Includes payments required under the traffic guarantee contract mechanism.  The nominal value of remaining payments does not include any amounts for future payments under this mechanism\".  It costs &euro;4.6 million because of the traffic flows and there are low and medium traffic growth projections.  What has it cost as part of the traffic risk sharing component to date and what is the projected cost based on current levels?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#T03500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>In the briefing document provided we have not provided projections for traffic guarantee or variable operation payments as they are described.

We had to engage with the European Commission to try to progress the scheme, to see how we might do it in terms of the procurement process.  We did not want to have to start the entire process again.  That was 2010.  It was 2014 when we awarded the contract.  There was significant downtime because of the funding crisis.  Had that not happened the scheme would have been built long before that.  Once we had got over that hurdle, and I am looking to my right at colleagues in the National Development Finance Agency who were our financial advisors on the matter, we eventually did get funders to come back into the market.  A very limited pool of banks was willing to fund then.  Earlier, additional schemes were mentioned.  These were developed at a difficult time for the economy and gave many jobs in the west at a difficult time for the economy.  It was very difficult.

We looked at contract management arrangements at that stage and I think the Deputy has already referred to an issue that I raised.  What we found at the time was that the CIT staff member acting as the contract manager for the two CIT projects had been involved with the project since the procurement stage and had been involved in managing the contracts since the two projects became operational.  The examination found that the contract manager had detailed knowledge of the project arrangements.  A matter that I raised in conclusion was that while CIT also had significant skills and experience in respect of the management of PPP contracts, there was a risk of over-reliance on a single individual as much of CIT's capacity in this area was vested in the contract manager for the two CIT projects.  The risk that was there would appear to have crystallised when the individual retired.  The college was left without a capacity and a knowledge base.  Based on what I have already reported, I do not think it is fair to characterise the individual as not having relevant skills or experience.

At this stage, we seek to identify all of the risks throughout the lifetime of the project, from planning stage to construction stage and in regard to facilities management and life-cycling to ensure that facilities will be handed back in a fit state after 25 years.  At the end of a PPP project, there is a residual life requirement.  For example, the roof would have to be good for 35 years, the plant and equipment would have to be good for ten years and the paint work would have to be good for five years.  Possible risks at each stage are identified and the cost of fixing any problems that arise are quantified.  We assign a probability to each of those risks and we develop a risk matrix.  We then identify who is the best party to manage the risk.  We only allocate risk to the private sector that it is best able to manage and we keep risks on the State side that we are best able to manage.  For example, in the case of a school in which there are pupils, we would not pass on that risk to the private school but we do pass construction risk to the private sector.  Once all of the risks have been quantified in a risk matrix, they are then translated into the contract and we ask the private sector to price in that regard as part of its bid for the facility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#GG02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Cahillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":800,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Cahillane satisfied that the formula for the calculating risk is the correct one?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#GG02100","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":801,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#GG02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Cahillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":802,"content":"<p>Does the Comptroller and Auditor General agree?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#GG02300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":803,"content":"<p>It is a process of estimation.

We have not made any unitary payments yet and we will not do so until the school is handed over.  This is an example of where risk transfer is working.  In the case of a PPP, they have very clear incentives to complete works and hand over the schools because they will not get any payments until they do so.<\/p> <p>  In the case of traditional procurement, the implications of a company going bust could be even more severe because we have made substantial capital payments during the course of the construction stage.<\/p><p>That could be more difficult for the State as we would have to get a new contractor to finish when we had invested a significant amount of Exchequer funds in the project.

It is an interesting example of how the risk transfer provisions with a PPP work and should be seen to work.  To answer the Deputy's question it is implicitly the case that within the comparator the risk is taken into account.  Whether we do it traditionally or by PPP, there is always a risk the developer could go bust.  I think of O'Devaney Gardens a number of years ago where the project did not happen.  One must then get a new contractor and there could be a delay where people who were relying on that housing may have to be housed elsewhere.  That is a cost or risk associated with any project, whether it is a PPP or official.  The point the Deputy makes is valid and those potential costs are inherent in all projects we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#GG02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":807,"content":"<p>Do we have a figure on any of those indirect costs which we may have accrued?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#HH00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":808,"content":"<p>It has not happened that often that we have had a situation in which a company has been liquidated.

There is that cost.  In the case of housing, people may have to be housed.  We can certainly come back to the Deputy if we can find historical examples where that has happened.  It is a challenge we face across the board.

That creates numerous problems for the State which we have to manage our way through as best we can.

We have moved back to the original budgetary control mechanism where in effect the capital cost of the PPP will be charged against the account of the body as if it were an Exchequer project.  That means that when the sponsoring entity or Department is looking at the project from an accounting perspective, there is no advantage one way or the other as to how that is accounted for when a decision is made on which option to go for.  If a secondary school costs &euro;20 million, for example, and it takes three years to build, that will be set notionally against the account of the Department of Education and Skills for its budget.  That means the PPP and the Exchequer or traditional approach would be accounted for in the same way when deciding on the merits of projects.

I have given one example of learning.  I will give a second.  There are more, but the second has been to change how we do the planning in terms of the processing.  We used to get outline planning permission and now we get full planning permission because that way there can be more certainty and it does not create a doubt, an uncertainty and a risk, especially given planning within the State.<\/p><p>That is very important.<\/p><p> I wanted to give a couple of examples to show that we have not introduced this, sat on our hands and not learned any lessons.  We have learned significant lessons.  I would prefer if we had completed a review and I am disappointed that we have not.  I referred to it as a mid-term review.  I would rather that we had done it a significant time ago but we have not been able to do so.  It is a very complex review.  We are going to take a bundle of approximately five schools to be compared to five other schools and analyse the effectiveness of how the facilities have been run, look at the standard of the buildings and compare and contrast all of those aspects.  It is going to be a huge piece of work.  We have tracked the numbers in the schools but the review will also consider that.  It is going to look at all of those elements and I expect that we will learn from it.  I do not think we will repeat it in the same way because it is so intense.  We started doing it four or five years ago and had to pause and rethink how we were doing it.  We have now restarted it.

The difficulty is that there is a dearth of genuine, transparent reporting and analysis in the State in regard to whether we get value for money.  One of the issues referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General is that far more could be done to improve public debate in this State on PPPs.

I am of the view that there has been insufficient scrutiny, oversight and genuine public debate because the data are not there.  None of the post-project reviews have been published.  How can any academic or think-tank evaluate them if the data or reviews are not available?  There is much we can learn and many improvements we can make in terms of what is going to happen.<\/p><p>It is just disappointing that it did not happen up to now.  Mr. Watt can respond to that if he wishes.  If I can just make a final point, the other thing I learned is that the code Mr. Watt referenced earlier is voluntary.  I want to come back to that.  It is not a legal requirement and it is not underpinned by legislation.  It is still a voluntary code.  That is something from a policy perspective, which is not a matter for Mr. Watt but for Government, to which we should return to in our own periodic report because it has been raised with us and we have had some discussion on it.  I do not know whether Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; or Mr. Watt would like to respond to my general observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#KK05500","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":912,"content":"<p>As an observation, in order to have a debate we need to put out information.  We have provided an awful lot of information as part of these discussions.  The first step is to look at the public sector benchmark and the comparator between the assessment of cost benefits for traditionally procured projects and those of projects procured through PPP.  For the first time that information is out there and that could lead to informed debate around assessing which option we should go for.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned in respect of a previous issue around risk, there is an element of estimation here.  It is not clear-cut.  There needs to be debate about that.  People need to scrutinise the comparator and see if they are content with its robustness.  Based on the information which we set out, there is potential to have a much more informed debate.  Just having the information out there does not, of course, mean that debate will be informed, but it has the potential to be.  The post-project reviews could also help, but let us see how that contributes to the debate.<\/p> <p>  This issue is not exclusive to PPPs.  It is relevant for all public works.  The whole debate is very important because there is a lot of discussion about how we fund infrastructure.  People talk about off-balance sheet and innovative solutions and all the rest of it.  Many Deputies responding to many policy issues suggest that there is an innovative or off-balance sheet solution when in fact there is not and the options are that the people who use the infrastructure pay for it, that the taxpayer pays for it now, or that the taxpayer pays for it on a deferred basis.  It must be clarified that somebody has to pay for infrastructure and that how we pay for it is the key issue.  I fully agree with the Deputy in terms of the debate.  <\/p> <p>  On the public code, I do not think we would describe it as voluntary.  It is not voluntary for Departments to decide whether they will do a cost-benefit analysis of a project.  They have to do it or the Minister for Finance or for Public Expenditure and Reform will not approve the money because the Government will not approve it.  It is not voluntary in that sense but there is no legal sanction because it is not based on legislation.  Of course, there are many things which we do not put in legislation for very good reasons.  Administrative rules and regulations drive much of our activity.  Whether we want to go down the route of trying to codify it in law is another policy issue but it would raise many different questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#LL00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":913,"content":"<p>I have one final observation.

There has, however, been a little bit of a myth that has been going around here today that these became popular during the recession when the State encouraged this type of finance.  I do not believe this is the case.  These projects were in their height in the good times before the recession.  When the recession came along many of the projects that had been in the pipeline stopped.  This is the exact opposite to what some people have said at the committee today.  The Clonee project for example started in 2010.  That contract would have been made three years earlier.  The Limerick project and the M50 were also in 2010.  This means that all those contracts were signed in 2007.  The Kilcock-Kinnegad contract was signed around 2002, the Dundalk contract would have been signed in 2002, the Fermoy project signed in 2003, the Waterford project was signed in 2006, the Galway-Ballinasloe M6 project was signed around 2006, the M7 and M8 in Portlaoise was signed around 2006-2007, and the motorway services project was signed around 2007.  It has been said a few times in this committee that most of these projects were going when the State was not able to access finance and that they were good for employment and so on.  This is not the case at all.  The projects actually ground to a halt then.  I recall some of the decentralisation programmes under PPP, one of which was three big Government offies in Carlow, Mullingar and Portlaoise.  These went to final stage in the process.  The contractor had spent millions of euro as the preferred bidder but the project was pulled at the end.  This is an example of the risks borne by bidders in competitions.  I have asked if that person was paid.  That instance was offices for the Government so it was probably an OPW project.  My point is that these projects collapsed during the recession and they are now picking up again.  They were not countercyclical.  They were very much it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#NN03100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#NN03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521709200,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>Am I correct in saying this?

They were not.  The assessments were done as a comparison.  I refer the committee to pages 12 to 14, inclusive, of the briefing document.  The information looks at post-project reviews.  Page 12 contains the list I have read out.  Page 13 looks at the conclusion of post-project reviews.  These are the reviews that have been done which will be published shortly.  When the committee sees these reviews, we will talk again.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has included some conclusions in the document forwarded to the committee today.  The conclusions cover planning, the implementation of projects, the objectives achieved in helping to reduce traffic volumes and congestion in towns and bypass routes, reduction in the numbers of fatalities, and the contribution to providing the motorway and dual carriageway network routes.  When Transport Infrastructure Ireland conducts its post-project reviews, how does it take account of the value of these motorways in the reduction of fatalities?  Motorways have done this.  Before these towns were bypassed by motorways, we know that people had been killed by vehicles in the towns.  It is a fact that the motorways have saved lives.  I cannot think of a town that did not have fatalities before the bypasses were constructed.  The bypasses also took the juggernauts out of the towns and allowed them to do a bit of local business instead of three miles of juggernauts each way every evening.  How does Transport Infrastructure Ireland incorporate this value or does it just do the review on specifics?  Does it look at societal benefits over and above cost values?  There are other benefits to motorways and does Transport Infrastructure Ireland take this into account?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032200002#NN04300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521709200,"counter":1057,"content":"<p>In the cost-benefit analysis of a scheme one would look at the existing history of that section of road.

Essentially, a lay person reading about the Limerick tunnel and Clonee route would conclude that, without the State agreeing to that minimum payment for minimum traffic, that project might not have happened.

We are nearly there.  I wish to raise some issues.  During the lunch break Deputy MacSharry raised the issue in previous meetings of the PAC information had been sought in respect of the Cork Institute of Technology.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has checked his records in the meantime and has confirmed that he did write back to the previous Committee of Public Accounts committee on 10 June 2014.  I wish to put that formally on the record as there was confusion about it earlier.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons we are here is because public private partnerships have a role.  I am agnostic on the policy approach but not everyone is agnostic on the issue.  If they are good, they are good.  If they do a job, I have no issue, but the public is always entitled to know whether we are getting value for money.  In the course of the past year we have had Transport Infrastructure Ireland before the committee and the Department of Education and Skills.  When we see a significant payment going out each year through the appropriation account for PPPs and we are told it is for a school or a bypass, the PAC does not know if it provides good value for money and that gives some people an opportunity to say it is not good value for money.  It would be in the interests of the PPP disciples to put more information out there to show whether the projects are good value for money to prove their point but as long as there are no explanations a vacuum causes problems.<\/p> <p>  In recent months the committee has not approved any appropriation account with PPP payments because we cannot say whether we think it is good or bad.  There is a gap in the process from the point of view of the PAC.  I cannot stand over appropriation accounts on the Plinth if there is a figure for &euro;120 million for a PPP if I and the PAC are not satisfied that it was good value for money.  The witnesses can understand where we are coming from.  There has been a lot of secrecy in the past but society moves on.  Contracts are in place and there is printed information available.  As time goes on people will know that once a contract is up and running the commercial sensitivity diminishes and it is not necessary to wait for many years to pass.  Essentially, that is one of the reasons we are here.<\/p> <p>  I know the committee will not be satisfied to conclude this chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report until probably much later in the year when we see some of these reports.  I do not say there is an issue but it will make it all the better if we can issue a report having seen more information but we are not at that point yet.  The witnesses seem to be saying we will get to that point soon.  In due course we will come back to that topic.  That is all I wish to say.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  I accept the exchanges in the meeting earlier on were robust but there is a bit of frustration among members due to the information that is not yet available that we would like to see.  We hope it will become available shortly.<\/p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses from the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Education and Skills, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff, and the National Development Finance Agency.  We will not dispose of chapter 4 for the reasons stated.  We will now adjourn until our next public meeting on Thursday, 29 March at 9 a.m. when we will be considering the grant funding to Galway's art house cinema, which is chapter 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.
