Peter Mathews made a valuable contribution to the important public debate about how to resolve the crisis.  I can recall that throughout that period, he, along with others, stood up and became actively engaged in working out different strategies for managing the crisis.  That speaks to his sense of civic duty.  I and the Central Bank want to recognise that important contribution.<\/p> <p>  I am here today in my capacity as the chair of the economic statistics review group, the ESRG.  This group was formed last summer to provide guidance to the CSO on how best to meet user needs for greater insight into Irish economic activity, taking account of the challenges inherent in providing a comprehensive picture of the highly globalised Irish economy.<\/p><p>The membership included policymakers, analysts, regulators, business and trade union representatives, as well as academics.  We also had input from the international statistics community, for example, EUROSTAT, the United Nations, the OECD and the IMF.  In addition, the ESRG benefited from written comments and presentations made by various members of the group and also by external contributors.  All of this material can be found on the CSO's website which includes the report and all of the ancillary material.<\/p><p> The CSO compiles national accounts and balance of payments data in accordance with global standards, which is essential if results are to be comparable across countries and over time.  EUROSTAT has also affirmed that the 2015 national income and expenditure accounts comply with these international standards.  However, it is increasingly difficult to interpret the complexities of activity in highly globalised economies by reference to the most familiar indicators such as gross domestic product, GDP, and gross national income, GNI.  Reflecting the increasingly interconnected nature of business and its growing fragmentation across national borders, it has become much more challenging to fully understand the impact of globalisation on national statistics.  We can think of particular issues relating to intangible assets such as intellectual property, the globalisation of production processes and the residential location of the corporate structures of global firms.  That is the backdrop.  Given all of this, it is critical to generate reliable measures of the aggregate size of the economy.  This is important for private sector decisions.  It is also essential for fiscal planning and, from the Central Bank's point of view, in assessing the sustainability of private and public debt levels.  For macro-prudential policy, the size of the economy is a necessary scaling factor in assessing the sustainability of the level of credit issued by the financial system.<\/p><p> As indicated, the CSO is mandated by international requirements to produce gross domestic product, gross national income and related measures.  However, it is the view of the ESRG that supplementary or extra statistics are more appropriate in the measurement of domestic economic activity.  These supplementary indicators need to be accessible and publishable in order that the confidentiality of data from individual firms is not compromised.  They also need to be sufficiently robust in order that possible future globalisation-related changes will not damage the relevance of the series.<\/p><p> One core recommendation of the group is the development of what we call an adjusted level indicator, GNI*.  Let me explain about the concept of GNI*.  A basic principle of national accounting is that in order to have a stable measure of economic performance it should be robust to cover alternative accounting approaches by multinational firms.  This is at the heart of one of the strands of the work we did.  For decades it has been recognised that GDP is an inadequate indicator in Ireland, given the size of measured factor income flows for multinational firms.  For this reason, gross national income or its close cousin, gross national product, has been widely employed since the 1980s as an alternative indicator, since these measures strip out net international factor income flows.  The profits paid to multinational firms are stripped out when going from GDP to gross national income.  However, we now find that even GNI is no longer a sufficiently reliable indicator.  In particular, there are two significant measurement issues, one of which is the treatment of depreciation in the foreign-owned component of the domestic capital stock.  The second which has been flagged in recent years is the treatment of the retained earnings of re-domiciled firms.  These are firms that have located their headquarters in Ireland and moved a lot of activity onto its balance sheet.<\/p><p>In both cases, measuring Irish economic activity on a gross basis as embedded in GDP or GNI now includes sizeable elements which, ultimately, are not accruing to domestic residents but are borne by or accrue to non-residents.<\/p><p> In the context of depreciation on the foreign-owned portion of the domestic capital stock, that is treated as being part of the overall indicators when it comes to GDP or GNI.  This is misleading because who bears the cost of that depreciation?  It will not be domestic residents but, rather, the owners of these foreign firms.  It should not, therefore, affect a measure that is intended to capture the resources available to domestic residents.  This is especially the case if the relocated capital assets are not deployed in combination with domestic workers but are used in combination with overseas workers through contract manufacturing arrangements.  For example, one could have intellectual property assets in Ireland which are being used for production elsewhere.  Essentially, it is just entering Ireland through the accounts of these multinational firms.  It is not something that is visible in the Irish economy.<\/p><p> This is why we have recommended the alternative GNI*, or GNI star, measurement, which, in the first instance, would exclude the depreciation of foreign-owned domestic capital assets.  This would prevent corporate re-organisations having an impact on measures of domestic economic activity and would recognise the reality that the ultimate owners of these assets are those who bear the depreciation costs relating to those capital assets.<\/p><p> With regard to re-domiciled firms, it is well recognised that issues arise because the accounting treatment of net income depends on whether a firm is classified as a directly owned foreign firm or as a domestic firm headquartered here which, in turn, is owned by foreign shareholders.  Substantially, it should make no difference but, because of global conventions relating to the rules in terms of recording capital income, it does.  The current position for a re-domiciled firm is that a firm here might accumulate net global income and it is recorded as part of GDP and GNI.  Eventually, it will leave the accounts if the firms declare a dividend.  However, many corporations are holding on to cash at present.  If they hold on to cash they are accumulating cash on the balance sheet here.  It is not flowing out of the economy but, at the same time, it is not really a part of the domestic resource base because ultimately the foreign owners will take the money out.  This is essentially the second adjustment.  We believe that rather than wait for the cash to be paid out, it should be recorded upon accrual if these firms are making profits.  We already do it for foreign direct investment, for this second category of re-domiciled firms.  Once the earnings are accruing here, they should be recognised as ultimately accruing to the foreign investor and should not affect important measures such as GDP or GNI.  Since we cannot affect the measurement of the GDP or GNI what we can do is create an extra indicator, GNI*.  That is the core recommendation regarding measuring the size of the economy.<\/p><p> In addition, in order to strategise for the economy and to think about its structure it is important to learn more about the breakdown between the domestic and foreign sectors in the economy.  Of course, any analytical presentation must respect the confidentiality of the data supplied by firms to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which constrains the level of detail that can be presented.  In addition, as I mentioned earlier it is important that any presentation is forward looking and is set up in such a way that it does not rule out future revisions by these corporations in how they do business.  Given those constraints, it is never going to be the case that one can go below a certain level of aggregation and, therefore, what can be possible is a set of other splits of the data.  Incidentally, this is also relevant in thinking about measures such as the current account balance of the economy and the international investment position of the economy.  Having more detailed splits of those data is important for analysis.<\/p><p> A third dimension of the report relates to understanding the cycle.  My colleague, John Flynn, is involved in our forecasting exercise.  We have to work out whether the economy is overheating or under-heating and so on.  More data revision is needed in this area.  When forecasting a high frequency activity, the focus is on expenditure measures such as investment, consumption and so on.  The problem is that at present the data, including the trade and investment data, are distorted by the massive gross flows related to the activity of multinational firms and aircraft leasing.  For practical purposes, those of us in the Central Bank and all other professional analysts have to make adjustments to come to something that is more related to the domestic economy.  For example, we try to strip out the impact of intellectual property investment and investment in aircraft that are used elsewhere and so on.  Essentially, we are recommending that the Central Statistics Office could publish adjusted measures rather than each individual analyst having to make decisions about these things.  This would then be the gold standard measures that domestic and global analysts could examine in considering the business cycle in Ireland.  Essentially, it involves netting out the impact of contract manufacturing and royalty payments for intellectual property and so on.<\/p><p> We also have some recommendations for conduct and how the CSO manages the national accounts.  One relates to communication.  The report identifies recommendations about how to enhance user understanding of Ireland's major releases in terms of the presentations, briefings, questions and answers and so on at the time of major data releases.  We note that it is essential to build on the ongoing co-operation at international and domestic level.  Internationally, the CSO is plugged in to various global initiatives to grapple with globalisation topics.  Domestically, we believe there is room for improvement in terms of the joint activities of the CSO and those of us in the Central Bank in respect of collection of relevant financial data.<\/p><p> Essentially, the message of this report is that the headline numbers are not adequate.  They are measured correctly, as affirmed by EUROSTAT, but they do not tell us what we need to know.  That is why having these extra indicators is important.  It is also important to be realistic in terms of what can be achieved in a given timeframe.  The most important point is to have a revision in terms of the annual data and adapting the quarterly data at a later period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022800002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488297600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Thank you, Governor.

The CSO welcomes its publication and thanks the chairperson and group members for their comprehensive and considered report.<\/p> <p>  The highly globalised nature of the Irish economy was demonstrated clearly in July 2016 with the publication of the national accounts and balance of payments statistics for 2015.  The 26% level shift in gross domestic product in 2015 was driven by relocations of entire balance sheets to Ireland, with the activity related to these relocations having significant consequential impacts on the results.  The relocated balance sheets were dominated by intellectual property categorised as intangible assets.  While the practice of relocating intellectual property to Ireland has been growing in recent years, the scale of the relocations in 2015 was substantial and added &euro;300 billion to Ireland's capital stocks.  In consequence, there were significant increases in the estimates for depreciation of assets in the national accounts.<\/p><p> Associated with the relocations were significant increases in contract manufacturing activity attributable to Ireland.  When the net effect of sales of products produced abroad under contract were added to Ireland's trade in goods, the balance of trade in goods and services in the national accounts doubled from &euro;35 billion to &euro;70 billion between 2014 and 2015, driving the level shift in GDP.<\/p><p> In the past, the impact of contract manufacturing activities on exports of goods was largely offset by imports of research and development services, as Irish companies made payments to non-resident parts of the group for the use of intellectual property.  However, when the intellectual property is located in Ireland, these offsetting charges do not occur and the full effect of contract manufacturing is attributed to GDP, as seen in the results for 2015.<\/p><p> To illustrate the impact of the relocations on GDP and GNP results for 2015, net national product grew by 6.5% between 2014 and 2015.  Net national product is an alternative indicator also published by the CSO from the national accounts framework.  It measures economic activity with many of the effects of globalisation activities removed.<\/p><p> The CSO compiles, and will continue to compile, national accounts and balance of payments statistics in accordance with the standards set by the United Nations, the IMF and as required under EU legislation.  Adhering to the international standards ensures the provision of results that can be compared across countries and across time.  In this context, the figures currently published are highly relevant and play an important role in describing the complexity of our economy.  However, the growth in globalisation activities presents a significant measurement challenge for all compilers of economic and business statistics, especially given the need to provide users with insight into domestic economic performance.  It is increasingly difficult to represent the complexities of economic activity in highly globalised economies, such as the economy of Ireland, in single headline indicators such as GDP and GNP.<\/p><p> Following the publication of the 2015 results in July 2016, and as part of its commitment to meeting user needs, the CSO convened the economic statistics review group in September 2016.  The mandate of the group was to develop recommendations on how best to meet the statistical needs of users of CSO statistics, especially national users, and to provide guidance on the development of a broader suite of domestically-focused economic indicators and information to supplement internationally agreed measures of economic activity, including GDP and GNP.  Statistics currently published by the CSO, such as data on employment and earnings, as well as information on personal consumption and expenditure, are important indicators of the domestic economy.  However, the discussions of the group also covered the need for additional indicators or for developments of detail in existing indicators.<\/p><p> The group met between September and November 2016 and submitted its report to me, as director general of the CSO, on 23 December 2016.  The report and the contributions to the work of the group were published on the CSO website on 3 February 2017, along with the initial response of the CSO to the report.<\/p><p> The report from the ESRG sets outs comprehensively the challenges for users of Ireland's economic and business statistics and makes 13 recommendations across five main themes.  Overall, the CSO will be taking an incremental approach to implementing the recommendations of the group.  Moreover, the CSO will take a top-down approach and plans to deliver a number of the key recommendations in 2017.  Work will extend into 2018.  In respect of this phase, the delivery of certain requirements for more detailed or more frequent results requires significant modifications to current processes.  There is a need to build new analyses from the bottom up using the most detailed micro-data available.<\/p><p> I will take the committee through some of the detail from the CSO response to the key recommendations across the five themes.  The first relates to the level indicators.  While levels of GDP and GNP continue to be important indicators of the size of an economy, the development of a new level indicator, GNI*, or modified GNI level, has been proposed by the group to measure the size of the complex and highly-globalised Irish economy.  This modified GNI indicator will exclude many of the effects of globalisation on Irish economic aggregates and will be a useful input for analytical and economic modelling work.  Ratio analysis where GDP or GNP is used as the denominator will continue to be required but users will now be able to complement this analysis by using GNI* as a denominator in the calculation of supplementary ratios.<\/p><p> The CSO intends to take a top-down approach.  Initially, the office plans to adjust the existing GNI and corresponding balance of payment measures for the retained earnings of re-domiciled firms, as well as for the depreciation related to intellectual property capital assets.  We will publish an annual time series of this indicator as part of the annual national income and expenditure, NIE and balance of payments, BOP, results in mid-2017.<\/p><p>During 2017 and into 2018, we will also work to develop quarterly and constant price series for GNI* and to quantify the effect of intellectual property asset relocation on individual components of the international investment position, IIP, data.<\/p><p> The report also recommends further development in the longer term of annual and quarterly net national product, NNP, at current and constant and prices.  Work to provide quarterly NNP at current prices has started and will continue during 2017.  Constant price estimates of NNP will be developed in 2018.<\/p><p> Regarding structural indicators, the highly globalised nature of the Irish economy makes interpretation of the economic statistics difficult for users who are interested in the role of domestic firms in the Irish economic statistics.  Separating results by foreign-owned multinational enterprises, MNEs, and other sectors will help to give users insight into how ownership structures impact the statistics.  The group has identified this structural insight as an important deliverable in its recommendations.<\/p><p> To make progress on this recommendation, the CSO will include a breakdown of the non-financial sector into large cases and other firms in the October 2017 annual sector accounts.  This new view in the sector accounts will include a breakdown of GDP and GNI for large cases and other firms.  The large case firms dominate Ireland&rsquo;s key business and economic aggregates, typically accounting for 80% of turnover in the economy and for 70% of exports of goods.  This new breakdown planned for the annual sector accounts will be a significant start towards providing the insight needed by users on the structure of the Irish economy.  In the longer term, 2018 and beyond, the CSO will work to expand the breakdown for foreign-owned MNEs beyond the large case firms and into other presentations of the national accounts data.<\/p><p> Regarding the cyclical indicators, it is important to recognise that globalisation activities are not limited to multinational enterprises.  Activities related to globalisation, such as contract manufacturing, are carried out by all types of firms and happen in both directions.  Irish-owned firms are involved in contract manufacturing and Irish firms are also providers of contract manufacturing services to foreign customers.  The additional detail on activities related to globalisation such as intellectual property relocation, contract manufacturing and aircraft leasing proposed under the cyclical indicator theme will provide important information on how these activities contribute to the aggregates.  The CSO plans to publish initial breakdowns of these details in mid-2017 at the time of the national income and expenditure release.  Along with the analyses in the structural indicators recommendations, these additional details on the activities identified will help to give users a comprehensive view of the effect of globalisation on the Irish economy.<\/p><p> Regarding co-operation nationally and internationally, the CSO's focus will continue to be on the compilation of consistent macro-financial statistics in its collaboration with other domestic institutions.  In addition, the international organisations co-operate closely on globalisation issues and the CSO will continue to be closely involved with this work, including participating, by invitation, in the advisory expert group to the UN Intersecretariat Working Group on National Accounts, the body responsible for the multi-year programme of development of the next generation of standards for national accounts statistics.<\/p><p> The CSO has appointed a head of communications and plans to establish a press office function and to restructure the existing information unit in line with the CSO&rsquo;s new communications policy.<\/p><p> Delivery of the recommendations by the CSO will be incremental with new key measures - GNI* and additional detail on globalisation activities - included with the annual national income and expenditure, NIE, results, scheduled for mid-2017.  By the end of 2018, the measures will be extended in stages to the various quarterly series where feasible.  Progress will be kept under review and feedback will be sought from users on developments.  Compilation of national accounts and balance of payments statistics will continue in line with the international standards and the new indicators and analyses will further develop within the existing frameworks for the statistics.<\/p><p> The CSO operates under the terms of the Statistics Act 1993, which sets out the mandate of the CSO and the standards by which we conduct our business.  Independent, objective, trusted and high-quality official statistics are the cornerstone of any developed democratic society.  A key element in ensuring that trust and quality is the legal guarantee in respect of the confidentiality of statistical returns made to the CSO.  This commitment to confidentiality is also established in the European statistical framework legislation and in the European statistics code of practice.  The legally binding guarantee of confidentiality given to all CSO data providers is essential to our ability to collect the data required to produce accurate outputs.<\/p><p>As a result, to ensure the proposed new measures will be, and can remain, robust, repeatable, consistent and comparable, the CSO will have to balance the additional detail made available against its commitment to ensure the confidentiality of data provided by respondents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022800002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488297600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Thank you assistant director.

In many cases, including those in which we have to report to our colleagues in Europe on the financial system, the regulations will refer to \"relative to GDP\".  My prediction is that in the surrounding commentary they will state that, relative to GDP, the numbers might look okay but because the figures for gross national income and GNI* are far below those for GDP, if we use the alternative indicators, our credit and fiscal position does not look so healthy.  This has been an ongoing issue for decades.  Gross national income and gross national product are stable at around 20% below GDP.  This has been true for a long time.  When we make this additional adjustment - I will wait to see what the CSO reports in mid-summer - it will be significantly below that figure again.  Therefore, they are big adjustments.  When we think about the public debt-to-GDP ratio, it will look a lot higher when we scale it using GNI*, while the stock of household and corporate debt will look a lot worse relative to this indicator.  For me, however, it will be more realistic.  The paradox, if one likes, is that this big bump in GDP makes the numbers look better.  However, when we actually look at what is going on and exclude depreciation and the profits of re-domiciled firms, while more reflective indicators such as GNI* will still show that the economy is performing well - just this morning we saw the unemployment number coming down to 6.6% - it is not doing well to the extent of the headline GDP number.  That is crucial and I am glad that the committee is paying attention to the topic and raising the awareness level in the wider Oireachtas.

What we were trying to identify here was the balance between confidentiality and provision of detailed information.  The trust that respondents have in us has a direct impact on the quality of the data that we compile.  For example, in April, when the members filled out their census forms, they did so because of the guarantee of confidentiality that the CSO gave them.  When they were filling out that form, they knew that the data they were giving to the CSO was going to be safe and secure.  That same guarantee of confidentiality has to exist for our business surveys as well and particularly for all of the enterprises or entities who respond to us.  Due to the impact of a relatively small number of multinational enterprises in our statistics, sometimes when we produce aggregate data we cannot publish it because it would be disclosive and therefore it would be a breach of official statistics.  If we publish data that leads to the identification of an individual company or entity, the likelihood of them providing us with data in the future is significantly reduced, just as if I breached members' confidentiality with a census form, I am sure they would be very slow to respond to us the next time around.  Maintaining that trust of respondents is critical, not just to the CSO but to any national statistical institute.<br\/><br\/>On the value of the data, someone mentioned the soundbite of some years ago, but it does not capture the complexity of the issue.  What gave rise to the figures in 2016, was that there was a relocation of entire balance sheets containing intellectual property rights back into Ireland.  The soundbite suggested that did not happen and it was not real.  It did happen and it was real and it was the consequential knock-on effect on how we had to treat the associated contract manufacturing in the statistics.  It is unfortunate in one sense that it gives the suggestion that those events did not happen.  From a statistical and from an economic perspective, Ireland is quite unique.  We are an extremely open and highly globalised economy, probably one of the most globalised economies in the world.  The figures we compiled last year accurately captured what happened and the comment from the IMF when we met them in Washington was the national accounts framework did its job.  <br\/><br\/>The national accounts framework produced official statistics that clearly highlighted the hugely globalised nature of the Irish economy.  That was really important; the job of official statisticians is to shine a light on issues that are relevant to the State.  In doing so, the problem was that it made it very difficult for commentators and analysts nationally to get a sense of what was happening in the underlying economy domestically and that is why we engaged the users and, in particular, we set up the Economic Statistics Review Group, because we felt it was important.  Users were telling us that they wanted more and better information to give them an insight into what is happening in the domestic economy, to net out the globalisation effects.  That is really important for national policy perspectives and for monitoring the sustainability of debt and so on.  <br\/><br\/>The group chaired by Professor Lane has come up with a suite of recommendations that the CSO will now implement.  We have been doing a lot of work over the last four or five years on this and we have already published a broader suite of publications.  We have an annual report on the multinational enterprise sector <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the domestic sector and we have done specific publications on aircraft leasing which have an impact on the national accounts.<\/p><p> We have done an increasing amount of work on labour and capital-based productivity.  We have also put together specific statistics on the re-domiciled plcs issue and how that impacts on the Irish national accounts.  What the economic statistics review group does is provides a more formal framework to pull together a broader suite of relevant indicators.  These are relevant in the sense that they give better insight into what is happening in the domestic economy.  That is what we are trying to do and that is what we have to continue to do.  Legally, we have to continue to produce GDP and GNP figures in accordance with international standards.  That is a legal requirement for Ireland Inc. in the same way as it is a legal requirement for all EU member states but we will also now produce a broader range of indicators that help domestic policymakers and people such as Professor Lane who need that data to get a better sense of what is happening in the domestic economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022800002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488297600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Mr. Dalton referred to the figures spiking in 2015 and 2016.

The good news is that all the numbers are growing, so we are not in a stagnation situation, but living standards in the economy are much more modest than the headline number.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022800002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488297600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>What would Professor Lane say on the vulnerability argument?

That is a highly political argument.  It suits a certain political view, or corporate view for some companies, to say that all the value is in the idea.  One could easily say that it is not really, because the idea without a product or sale does not mean anything at all.  Is one of the ways we could lessen the vulnerability on this to be to the forefront, which we are not, in arguing for some sort of international, not just European-wide, consolidated tax base where we assign, and have a serious debate about, relative value of intellectual property versus other parts of the production chain?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017022800002#R00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488297600,"counter":65,"content":"<p>The Deputy signalled the context in which that debate is being held, which is to ask what the appropriate tax base is for taxing corporations, which is a political decision.<\/p><p>Is it where production takes place, should it be based on where the customer is or should it be based where the intellectual property is held?

One of the big discussions at a European level at the minute is around the issue of income consumption and wealth.  That is a key discussion, and the CSO has plans to create a new area, a new division, focusing on income consumption and wealth, which is a direct attempt to address the issues the Deputy has raised.  For example, on the distribution analysis that we already do, if one looks at the EU survey on income and living conditions, we do an income distribution across the ten deciles, but within each decile we break it down between direct income and social transfers in order that the impact of direct income, which is primarily employed or self-employed income, can be seen.<\/p><p>One can see the impact of that at an overall level in the State but can also get it for each decile across the income distribution, which partially references the wage issue to which the Deputy referred.

We are already doing some of that.  <\/p><p> On the wealth side, the CSO carried out a wealth survey that was funded by the Central Bank of Ireland for the first time three years ago and we are going to do it again.  The CSO wants to formally make this a part of its statistical work programme in order that it is carried out every three years on an ongoing basis.  Wealth is seen as the missing piece.  We have data on income and consumption but traditionally we have not had data on wealth.  We want to introduce that, which will allow us to produce a linked picture between the macro and the micro, which to an extent is missing at present.  We also will invest in trying to produce those horizontal outputs that link macro and micro.  Rather than having stovepipe publications on national accounts and employment and unemployment and retail sales, we will try to do horizontal pieces that build a picture and link between the macro and the micro. <\/p><p> Sometimes we can drown in the amount of data available and sometimes, before seeking more data we should ask ourselves whether we actually are using all the data we currently have.

It is about setting Europe as a leader in clean energy.  To date, Ireland has played a key part in successfully developing Europe's position on clean energy, particularly with renewables.  For example, CER recently had a visit from the Australian Government which has had major challenges in implementing renewable energy generation and was looking for input from us.  Similarly, we had a delegation from Japan, again looking for experience from Ireland.  Ireland is really at the forefront.  However, there are significant challenges ahead with the integration of renewables.  The European Commission&rsquo;s winter package, the other name for the clean energy for all Europeans package, tries to address some of these challenges of the integration of renewables.  In that context, fundamental changes will need to be made to energy systems.  This package sets out some of the key parameters which need to be changed.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, we are involved in a major translational project of changing the electricity market across the island, the integrated single electricity market, ISEM, project.  We have an all-island committee, the single electricity committee, of which Ms Aoife MacEvilly and I are both members.  We are in the process of changing the market in a way that will align it with the rest of continental Europe.  We believe this change is going to help converge the design of our market with the rest of Europe.  It will also help make our market closer to that in Great Britain, which will be an interesting issue.  It will improve the efficiency of trading energy, improve the integration of renewables and, ultimately, help consumers develop better outcomes from their point of view.<\/p> <p>  The winter package is massive, comprising 1,000 pages and covering all aspects of energy regulation currently in place.  While we broadly support it, we need to have some caution.  There are elements of the package which have a risk of overreach from the European Commission, particularly a one-size fits all approach.  For example, it talks about network tariffs being set centrally at a European level.  I sit on the board of European regulators and we are pushing back at some elements of this, saying we need to be cautious and ensure a system suitable for the various member states, including Ireland.  We have a different market here with different types of technology compared to the rest of Europe.  It is important we ensure this ultimately works for consumers on this island, as well as working for consumers across the rest of Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017022800002#B01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488301200,"counter":98,"content":"<p>We see the clean energy package having a welcome focus on energy consumers at its heart and driving this transition to a clean energy market.  There are many aspects of the package which deliver specific rights and protections for consumers.  Some of those would be already familiar to Irish consumers such as competitive markets, opportunities to shop around, value and choice from suppliers, deregulated tariffs, as well as the availability of price comparison tools, which are accredited and certified so consumers can have faith and confidence in those.  These are elements of our market which are taken for granted by Irish consumers.  A key element of the package is ensuring those benefits are delivered for all energy consumers across Europe.<\/p> <p>  There are also aspects of the package which are completely transformational for energy consumers such as rights of consumers to smart meters, to better information, to better opportunities to participate in the market, as well as rights to have dynamic tariffs so they can be a part of the market.  As well as driving the transition, they can participate and be part of the demand-side response.  For example, when there is much wind on the system, they can generate their own electricity and sell it to the grid at times when they are not using it.  This is transformational change for Ireland and Europe, which we welcome.<\/p> <p>  Much of the work we have been engaging in, along with the industry in Ireland, particularly around the delivery of the national smart metering program, will pave the way for this transformation to be delivered in Ireland.  We broadly welcome those aspects of the package which focus on delivering those benefits to consumers throughout Europe.<\/p> <p>  We see no immediate impact from Brexit on the Irish energy market.  Like all sectors, however, there are potential implications depending on the outcome of the negotiation process.  Within that, we strongly welcome the commitment of the Governments in Ireland and in the UK to the retention and importance of the all-island single electricity market.  As Brexit interacts with this clean energy package, there are some aspects it will not impact, such as the consumer protection measures I referred to earlier.

There is a sustainable energy community network.  There are now 60 to 70 members in that from local communities.  We are effectively trying to provide consumers with more awareness, inform them and empower them to engage in this, tell them about these technologies, give them the ability and the confidence effectively to buy into this and derive some value from it.  We give them the ability to create their own roadmaps for their communities, and we give them mentors and support to engage with consultants and advice to do the same.  The aim is to bring them towards our larger funding projects like the better energy communities scheme, under which 37 projects funded 383 community buildings and about 2,000 homes in combination at a parish level.  It creates that awareness and joint effort.  It is important to note that we need something material around renewable electricity specifically and, with the Department, we are helping to design a framework which would help communities invest and participate more materially in the types of projects we will see in the future of renewable electricity.  We need to admit to ourselves that the communities are different and we need to be adaptable and responsive to them.  One size may not fit all.<\/p> <p>  Good progress has been made towards 2020 under renewables but there is a lot left to do.  We reached 9.1% at the end of 2015, but there is still a gap to reach 16%.  It will be a challenge to us.  We support the level of ambition outlined in the renewable energy directive at 27% across the EU.  Again, it is not without challenges.  With regard to how Ireland achieves its devolved ambition, it will have to be carefully thought out.  We are a peripheral state at the edge of Europe with our own conditions around resources and our own grid.  We will be at the centre of this.  What we are trying to do is progress aspects such as the renewable heat incentive, which it is hoped will be completed by the end of this year and will begin to produce some impact on that sector.  Separate from that, as we move into next year we are trying to support the Department as it designs an updated renewable electricity support scheme in whatever shape that may take.<\/p> <p>  Energy efficiency is where Ireland has led and that has been recognised across Europe in the past.  We really have been at the forefront.  We must not be complacent about that and really push on.  There will be a binding target for 2030 in energy efficiency.  I believe it is also important that it is recognised as the most cost-effective way of decarbonising.  The unit of energy one does not spend is the cheapest.  It also helps us with our renewable electricity targets because it is a percentage of what we use.  If we reduce the overall pot of what we use, that percentage becomes easier to achieve with what we have on the ground.  It hits a number of different targets in terms of achieving them and separately in terms of involving communities and businesses, because every business and home will have its own part to play.<\/p> <p>  We have put in place a couple of pieces of work this year.  We have put in place greater capital schemes for the public sector across the Office of Public Works, OPW, and schools, and we are interacting more effectively in terms of leveraging off the private sector and getting it to invest more money into what we are doing.  We are also looking at different and more subtle market interventions.  We are setting up a behavioural economics unit to try to look at how we can incentivise change without putting as much capital into it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Brexit, it is not really in our purview.  From our perspective, there are a lot of similar themes in the philosophy that underpins the clean energy package and in what underpinned the creation of the single electricity market.  It is about providing best value to the consumer and making best use of the power on the system and of the shared and combined infrastructure.  The indications from both Governments at this point is that it is on their agenda.  I believe it must remain there.  From our perspective, we speak to the consumer and the business all the time and the issue of energy is cross-cutting.  The more efficient and effective we can make that, the better for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017022800002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1488301200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank the witness.

The clean energy package is a very positive step forward.  It is important to say that it is the next step along the journey of the integration of the European electricity market.  For that alone, it is to be welcomed.  There are some areas that are important to keep an eye on as we move forward with the new package.  In and of itself, it is a set of proposals which will now be looked at over time and negotiated.  There is the opportunity to look at the proposals and find areas in which we believe we could influence change.  That is something that we have the power to do as time goes on.  I might concentrate on some of those areas as I look at it.<\/p> <p>  We have had a very successful single electricity market operating on the island for about the past ten years, as has been mentioned.  We are about to implement the next phase of that in the integrated single electricity market.  It is more than just the single electricity market.  We have had in effect an all-island approach to energy that has been hugely successful for the consumers on both sides of the Border, North and South.  It has also gone a little bit unsung in terms of being very successful politically as something that is operated with little hassle on an all-island basis.  It is something that we should not lose sight of as we move forward.  With that in mind, as we look forward to either Brexit or the clean energy package, we must try to continue that all-island success into the integrated single electricity market.<\/p> <p>  We must move into that next step and look at the package.  Ireland is a unique system.  Everyone likes to see themselves as unique, but we are right on the periphery of Europe in many senses, and certainly electrically.  From an electricity perspective, we have two interconnections to Britain as things stand.  That gives us very important interconnection into Britain and all the way through to Europe, but a limited amount of it.  Policies that look solely at central Europe and, either technically or from a market rules perspective, concentrate on central Europe are a bit one-sided from our perspective in terms of how they operate.  In looking at the package, it sets out a number of requirements which would see more functions moved to central Europe.<\/p> <p>  This involves areas such as the role of European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, ENTSOE, which is the European body for transmission system operators, TSOs, similar to ourselves across Europe.  It also involves the Agency for the Co-operation of European Regulators, ACER, which is the European regulators' body - similar to the Council of European Energy Regulators, CEER - across the whole of Europe.  It looks to strengthen the roles of ACER and set up new bodies known as regional operation centres.  While these regional operation centres are good in terms of encouraging co-operation between system operators across Europe, it comes back to that point I am making about the fact that one size does not fit all when operating electricity systems or markets.<\/p> <p>  This is particularly true when we think about energy sovereignty and our own abilities.  As an example, when the IDA looks to introduce foreign direct investment into the country and bring in some new firms, such as some of the big data centres the committee would have heard about recently, a number of our colleagues and ourselves meet the IDA.  A big part of the conversation is looking at energy costs and how they are linked to clean energy.  In Ireland, we have a great opportunity because we have very clean energy.  We also have very reliable energy.  Our system has been extremely reliable over time.  A large part of that is that we have the capability to make decisions from our perspective in Ireland.  Some of the decisions that are proposed to be put out to Europe would be core system security decisions that, from an energy sovereignty point of view, we believe should stay on this island.  Again, there are a set of proposals in place currently, but over time it is important to look at those proposals and seek to influence an increase in co-operation across Europe.  We do not want to lose some of those key pieces that mean we are able to give investors coming to Ireland the kind of guarantees they are looking for.  We are competing against other European countries that are right in the middle of Europe and may have a wider portfolio of solutions available to them than we would, being on the periphery of Europe.  It is important for us to look at that.<\/p><p>Then there is the matter of the way in which policies are developed.  Central European policies that suit the way in which a market is run in the middle of Europe, for similar reasons, will not necessarily work for us.  The influence we have had to date through co-operation with the regulators, the industry in Ireland and in particular the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has been very important because we have been able to take direct control of the drafting of some of the codes that govern how the new market will operate.  This role and the way in which we have worked together will be important into the future.  Some of the proposals that have been put forward would see more functions moved centrally into Europe, taking away the national regulators, national transmission system operators, TSOs, and national policymakers' influence in the field.  Again, we must be careful to get the right mix.  To date, we have quite a good balance between co-operation and obligation.  I do not want to see this slip the other way and find there are too many obligations with which Ireland, with its particular characteristics, finds it difficult to comply.  As mentioned already, the package is very wide-ranging, but we should keep a close eye on the way in which these new institutions will be set in Europe and the responsibilities they will be given as we move forward.<\/p><p> Regarding Brexit, I think it has been mentioned that we believe the new integrated single electricity market, I-SEM, is very important.  It is a link between us and Britain and on into Europe.  Either way, it is a bilateral market between us and Britain and should be implemented under all circumstances.  All our conversations to date with our colleagues in Britain indicate that there is no reason it should not go ahead.  Huge benefits are to be gained from increasing the trade between us and Britain for energy customers.  With this in mind, we are considering the potential impacts of Britain's exit.  These tend to be edge effects in respect of changes to legislation, rules, etc.  Anything that would see energy tariffs introduced would be a major negative from our perspective and something we would want to see resisted strongly because it would inhibit the good functioning of the way in which the two markets trade.  Further, if Britain is no longer part of the energy market in Europe, we no longer have a direct link into the European energy market in the same way.  Therefore, building a direct link to the energy market in Europe is a positive.  We in EirGrid have been investigating with our colleagues in R&eacute;seau de Transport d'&Eacute;lectricit&eacute;, RTE, in France, the build-out of the Celtic interconnector, which would link directly from Ireland into the French electricity market.  From a Brexit perspective and a wider European energy market perspective, this would be positive.  It has been identified as a project of common interest, PCI, in Europe, and it is very good to get that standing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017022800002#C01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rodney Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488301200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I now call our final witness, Mr. Peter O'Shea, head of strategy and regulation at ESB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017022800002#D00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488301200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to speak here.<\/p> <p>  ESB is supportive of the proposed clean energy package which the EU published in November but, like some of the previous speakers, we urge some degree of caution, particularly over the one-size-fits-all perspective of it.  We see the package as an important part of how the EU and Ireland will meet the obligations which we have all signed up to in the COP21 accord, and it will seek to give effect to the EU's 2030 targets.<\/p> <p>  Rightly, the EU sees electricity as a crucial component of the overall energy system, particularly in addressing climate change.  In Ireland, we have built a modern, reliable electricity system with ample generation capacity supplying power to customers over modern networks and with a high degree of smart technologies.  All this has been achieved while keeping electricity prices at around the eurozone average.<\/p> <p>  However, one of the fundamental changes over the past decade and a half has been the growth of renewable energy, renewable electricity in particular in Ireland.  Last year, we had the second-highest penetration of wind generation in the European Union, behind Denmark, and renewable connections are still ramping up to push us towards our target of delivering 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020.  In my mind, this is an extraordinary achievement for a small island and is recognised as such by the European Commission.  More important, as we face into the clean energy package, it provides Ireland with a strong platform to address decarbonisation into the future.<\/p> <p>  While electricity is a crucial part of the energy system and is progressively moving towards low carbon, it is important to know that electricity is responsible for only 20% of the total energy used in Ireland and only 20% of total greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland.  It is greenhouse gas emissions which cause climate change and it is the reduction of these gases which is the objective of the climate and energy framework.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, in 2015, we emitted 60 million tonnes of greenhouse gas in total, and of this, approximately 12 million tonnes was from electricity generation.  Three other sectors make up the rest: agriculture at approximately a third; heat, which is similar to electricity generation, accounting for approximately a fifth of total emissions; and transport, which is responsible for just under a quarter of total emissions.<\/p> <p>  Electricity generation emissions are falling.  In absolute terms, they have fallen from 15 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes between 2005 and 2015, while the carbon intensity of electricity has almost halved since 1990.  By contrast, the trend in transport has been upwards, and the take-up of renewable energy in heat has been low, leaving it vulnerable to emissions increases as the population grows.<\/p> <p>  It is the total of these emissions across electricity, heat and transport which Ireland needs to reduce.  Our national policy position is to try to reduce them by 80% between now and 2050.  To put this into numbers, this means moving from 38 million tonnes from the energy system at present down to less than 6 million tonnes by 2050.  This is a huge challenge for Ireland.  In ESB, we have considered a number of studies to ask what sort of roadmap would give us the prospect of meeting this challenge and we have come up with a number of different aspects to it.  First and foremost is the continued decarbonisation of electricity as renewable energy grows towards and beyond 50% by the middle of the next decade and further new low-carbon generation completing the journey towards 2030 and then onto 2050.  Secondly, we need to decarbonise transport with electrification of the light vehicle fleet and the use of compressed natural gas and bio-methane in the HGV fleet.  We also need to decarbonise the heating and cooling of our buildings, initially containing the growth of emissions in new houses through new standards for building regulations, but also reducing the existing stock of high-emission houses through a national renovation programme.  Finally, we need to decarbonise our industry process heat with a progressive move to renewable heat or carbon dioxide type capture solutions.<\/p> <p>  This roadmap allows us to ask the questions about the clean energy package.  These are the specific questions we ask ourselves: Does the package encourage and enable decarbonisation of Ireland's electricity system between now and 2050?  Does the package facilitate the decarbonisation of transport through electrification or other means?  Does it facilitate the decarbonisation of heat, again through electrification or other means?  Do the individual measures in the package provide sufficient support to Ireland's unique circumstances?  In particular, across the EU we have among the largest share of emissions in the non-traded sector which, when coupled with the large scale of our agriculture emissions, creates an imperative for early decarbonisation of heat and transport.  At an overview level, I suggest that the package is strong in terms of measures to decarbonise electricity and less strong in terms of measures to decarbonise heat and transport.  In this respect, it continues the present trend.  To be clear, this is not to say that electricity does not need to be decarbonised; it most certainly does.  However, we need to have a much greater focus on the heat and transport sectors if we are to crack the climate challenge.<\/p> <p>  I will now consider and comment on some of the details of the clean energy package, starting with the electricity sector.  Does the package help the electricity sector to decarbonise?  In broad terms, it does when viewed alongside the effort sharing regulation and reform proposals to the European Union's ETS scheme.  Taken together, these measures provide a strong legislative and political framework for Europe.  There are a number of areas which we will need to consider further.  For example, some of the proposals on biomass and capacity remuneration may inadvertently limit member-state-specific solutions.  I mention again the one-size-fits-all perspective in this respect.  In broad terms, it is important that member state flexibility is maintained, and this is why we in ESB support both RES and energy efficiency targets being at an EU level rather than a member state level.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to consider the heat and transport sectors, again, does the package get the balance right?  I suggest on a preliminary basis that it does not quite get it right.  The package is still very electricity-centric: the vast majority of the measures proposed in the package are centred around the electricity system, when it is clear that action is required in other sectors.  That is not to say there are not positives in this.  The energy performance of buildings directive contains measures to encourage renewable heat in buildings and measures that are positive for low-carbon transport.  However, one concern with the energy performance directive is that district heating is excluded as a means of meeting the renewable requirement.  District heating involves piping heat from a central source to the point of use.  The central source is subject to the emissions trading scheme and is therefore on a clear decarbonisation trajectory.  District heating should not be disadvantaged through this directive, and we suggest that this be changed.<\/p><p>The energy efficiency directive retains the concept of primary energy factor in energy efficiency gain calculations.  This is a technical point but an important one as it works against using low-carbon electricity to decarbonise heat.  These are just some of the issues we will bring to the attention of the Department in the consultation process.<\/p><p> Within the ESB we have adopted a watching brief on Brexit.  We are members of Energy UK and of the Electricity Association of Ireland and through that we have influence at EURELECTRIC.  The broad perspective we are getting from our peers is to try to keep the existing arrangements as they are.  A common point between us, the Europeans and the UK is that we are all net importers of energy.  We hope that some pragmatic decisions are taken in that respect.  The biggest problem we face is that over time, we will see greater divergence on policy between what is happening in Europe and in the UK.  It is difficult to anticipate what will be the implications of that.  One interesting example is that a couple of years ago, the UK Government proposed a carbon price floor for electricity generation across the UK.  Had that been implemented, it would have had an impact on the single electricity market in Ireland.  Following discussions with different parties the UK Government decided not to implement that legislation in Northern Ireland.  Similar pragmatic thinking will be required to maintain the common direction of the single electricity market and our energy business overall.

There is a principle established that we must embody in what we do year on year.  It is important that we bring them early into the policy dialogue in order that their point of interaction is not when they first interact with infrastructure or smaller scale technology.  The Department has opened up a dialogue on the clean energy package quite early.  There might be only a small level of interaction at the start but if we keep people informed and abreast of developments, it embeds not necessarily acceptance but awareness.  I have mentioned a couple of the programmes we have under way to inform people.  All of our touch points, including performing 90,000 building energy ratings per year and interacting individually with 22,000 homeowners who upgraded their homes last year through our programmes, should be a method by which we can engage them in this sort of debate and inform them of what might come next.  Specific projects are important too where we can say here is some best practice but along with that, here are the seven lessons learned, here is where it went wrong.

They all referred to the energy consumer or energy citizen as being at the heart of the issue.  The wholesale price of electricity has dropped by 30% yet at retail level it is down only 3%.  Could the regulator address that?  Is there anything in this package that will strengthen the regulator's hand, that will allow the CER to focus more on the consumer and if so when is that likely to be ready for transposition?<\/p> <p>  I hear a lot of push-back from the citizen and from industry, particularly small to medium enterprises, SMEs, which are looking aghast at the marketplace and seeing that the reduction in the wholesale price is not reflected in their bills.

Mr. Slye has indicated that it is feasible and financially viable to make the interconnector.  Large energy consumers that I talk to are concerned that they will pay for it.  Will the interconnector only benefit the rest of Europe?  Some who are against wind turbines are concerned that we will be seen as a country that will generate a lot of clean electricity for the benefit of others.<\/p><p>I spoke to a Slovenian colleague yesterday who, having looked at this package, thought it would put an enormous burden on Slovenia because 40% of its landmass is covered by the Natura 2000 classification.  Slovenia has only a handful of wind turbines.  With its topography and various other constraints, it will not be able to reach the same level of renewables.  It has issues with hydroelectric power because the area concerned lies within a Natura region.  If there it is to be a 27% target of renewable energy consumption across Europe, will we have to carry a much greater burden to assist in reaching that average.

I have a number of questions. The first of which is for the CER.  While energy prices, in terms of gas and oil, have dropped and we have more renewable energy on stream, customers are not benefiting from the reduction in energy prices.  My electricity bill continues to increase every year despite the fact that we are using the same amount of electricity.  My neighbours would say the same thing.  Household energy bills are increasing.  The wholesale energy price has dropped significantly - by in the region of 30% - but the customer is not feeling the benefit of that reduction.  What is the CER doing about that?<\/p> <p> On the issue of the programme and the reference to a concern about over-reach, are different regulatory bodies in the 28 member states co-operating in terms of trying to do something about that?  There are benefits to being in the programme but we do not want the big foot of Europe to come down too heavy on us.  What level of co-operation is there around that?<\/p> <p>  Having met the representatives of the ESB and having different contacts in it, while there is much talk about buying into renewables, the company would still seem to be overdependent - in the future it will be overdependent - on a small number of big generation sources.  There will be thousands of electricity generation sources in the future.  Unless I am missing something, I do not believe the ESB is moving quickly enough towards bringing those sources on stream and tapping into more and smaller sources of renewable energy.  The representatives of the ESB might indicate where the company stands in terms of smart meters.<\/p> <p>  Regarding a green bond scheme - I know the ESB operates a scheme of this type - there is a major problem in rolling it out.  A deep retrofit programme is being discussed and we know it is needed.  We have retrofitted a great number of houses that were built in the past 30 or 40 yeas, but many houses were built 60 or 100 years ago and we all know they are more difficult to retrofit and carry out energy upgrades on, even though there are new technologies and new building materials available.  I refer, for example, to insulated plaster slabs, which are God's gift.  Such schemes are not being rolled out.  We need to have a big idea in that respect and to have a big push to promote insulation.  There is a scheme in place providing for the external house insulation, but the work involved is difficult, expensive and I am not convinced about the wisdom of putting sponge-like material on the outside of buildings, particularly in view of the fact that we have a wet climate.  I am not sure if we are seriously focused on promoting internal insulation to keep houses warm.  An imaginative scheme in terms of a green bond initiative, initiated by the SEAI and the ESB, is needed.  In other words, if a household's electricity bill is &euro;150 every two months and if the owners have improved their insulation, their electricity bill would fall to &euro;100 every two months and the &euro;50 they saved could be paid off the sum required to do that work.  Such schemes operates in other jurisdictions.  I would like the representatives from the ESB to comment on that. matter.  The representatives from the CER or the SEAI can also comment on it if they wish. <\/p> <p>  My next question is for EirGrid.  The French are fairly keen on having the Celtic interconnector.  It was stated that it would cost approximately &euro;1 billion.  Will that cost be split evenly, namely, &euro;500 million paid by our little State and &euro;500 million by the much larger state of France?  Do we have the option of securing EU funding for the project, given that we will be very peripheral, particularly when the Brits perform a kamikaze manoeuvre and move away from the EU?  Can we make a case for EU funding for that project?<\/p> <p>  The issue of tariffs in the context of Brexit is a concern.  I refer to tariffs applying to electricity sources coming into the country but also applying to electricity sources in terms of trying to maintain the single market  for electricity on the island, which has been operating well for the past ten years.  Should we be seeking special status for the North within the European Union?  We know that the North will be dragged out of the Union against its will in the aftermath of Brexit.  Should we be pursuing the goal of the Six Counties retaining special status within the European Union?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017022800002#F00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1488301200,"counter":124,"content":"<p>The representatives of the CER might begin by responding to those questions from Deputies Dooley and Stanley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017022800002#F00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488301200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I will begin by responding to the question on Brexit and the issue of tariffs.

From our point of view, that  would be an adverse development, whether it be gas or electricity, and we would strongly argue for a tariff-free approach.  If tariffs were to apply to either or both, they would have a significant impact on consumers.  We will need to keep a close eye on that as it develops.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Stanley's question on overreach and what are we doing at a European level, a European board of regulators is referred to in this package.  It already exists and I sit on that board.  Deputy Dooley mentioned Slovenia and the board is based there, so I am a regular visitor to Slovenia to attend those meetings.

Members may be aware that the CER has recently published a major review of the operation of retail markets in Ireland.  We specifically looked at whether competition is delivering for consumers.  The key findings were that competition is delivering benefits, particularly for active energy consumers, and we can see that.  There are two areas where we want to do more work.  First, because many consumers are not as active, they are not seeing the same level of benefits.  The other is highly pertinent to the question the Deputy asked.  We have seen retail prices fall in recent years, driven largely by the falling wholesale price to which both Deputies referred.  However, there are other elements of cost, so it is not a direct one-to-one relationship between wholesale and retail prices.  We have seen network costs increasing.  We regulate network costs, so we understand that.  We are investing more to deliver more benefits and to decarbonise our energy system.  We have also seen what we call the supply cost element increasing.  That is an area on which we have less visibility.  We have said in our review that we want to understand that better and to ensure we are seeing the full value passed on to consumers.  That is an area we are investigating further.  We are seeking input from the energy companies to understand what that dynamic is showing us.  Are there increasing costs for energy suppliers and are there ways in which we can help tackle those costs?  That is an area to which we are giving full focus at the moment.  Our review has been a critical moment for the evolution of policy in this area.  Deputy Stanley's bill should have been falling if he has been using the same amount of electricity.  All suppliers have reduced their unit charges by some extent, so we have seen those benefits pass through.  Our question is whether the full extent is being passed through.  That is what we want to understand better.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what more might be done, particularly in terms of this passage, a real emphasis is on encouraging customers to be more active.  That may be shopping around and finding what is the best value or participating in the market through enabling technologies like smart meters or potentially other smart home energy efficiency opportunities or the opportunity to export.  We believe potentially game-changing opportunities for customers are coming down the tracks.  If a customer is really keen to see the full pass-through of what is happening with the wholesale price, they may be interested in a dynamic tariff.  Dynamic tariffs are on the table.  <\/p> <p>  Broadly, the emphasis of the clean energy package is very much in line with the areas that we are looking at.  It is trying to ensure that we have efficient pricing, market-based pricing and fully competitive markets and to ensure that is passed on to consumers.  It also is about ensuring that consumers are really well informed and active, are shopping around and have opportunities to gain the best value.  We introduced a number of changes late last year about how we can provide better information to consumers and make it simpler for them to do that, even in the existing market.  There is a lot more that we can do to help consumers there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017022800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488301200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>There was a common thread between Deputies Dooley and Stanley around the Celtic interconnector.  It will only be built if it makes sense for Irish consumers.  It also needs to make sense from a European and a French consumer perspective.  In terms of money invested in it on the Irish side, it needs to clearly demonstrate that that is of value and delivers value for Irish consumers.  There is a lot of talk about the need to bring prices down here.  One of the effects of a Celtic interconnector would be that we would have access to continental European power prices, which are lower than Irish electricity prices.  The goal of the interconnector is not to drive policy in terms of exporting renewables, it is to make sure that we make the best use of the resources that we have and to allow us to import power from Europe more cheaply.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the allocation of costs, for projects like this there is a regulatory process in Europe called cross-border cost allocation, CBCA.  The CER, with its counterparts in France, looks at where the benefits for the project fall, be that in France or elsewhere in Europe.  If the benefits predominantly accrue to one country, should the costs predominantly fall on that country?  We believe that the project should receive European funding.  To date, it has received funding for the previous phase and the current phase.  These phases are relatively small money in comparison to the overall capital costs of future phases.  We will make sure that whatever grants or funding is available in a European context will be availed of.  The Connecting Europe facility has funded 50% of the cost of the project to date, with the remainder split on a 50:50 basis between ourselves and the French electricity transmission network, R&eacute;seau de Transport d'&Eacute;lectricit&eacute;, RTE.  The overriding message is that it will only be delivered if it delivers benefits for Irish consumers.  That is an absolute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017022800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488301200,"counter":129,"content":"<p>In regard to Deputy Dooley's question on pricing and just to follow up on what the commissioner said, first, it is important to recognise that wholesale prices are approximately half of the retail price.  Every movement in wholesale prices will not be seen in full on retail prices.  The rest is network costs, supply costs, and also the public service obligation, PSO, levy.  The way the PSO works is that when wholesale prices are high, it is low.  When wholesale prices are low, it is high.  The other comment to make on that is that suppliers buy their fuel stock forward.  They hedge their fuel prices with gas or coal or whatever.  As a result, changes in wholesale prices are not immediately seen because the actual cost the supplier is seeing is the price they have paid under contract to buy forward.<\/p> <p>  I can assure Deputy Stanley we are building small-scale generation in both wind and solar.  We have entered a joint venture with Kingspan to build out solar on rooftop.  The future is going to be a lot of small generation but it is not the only part of the future.  There will be a role for larger-scale generation as well, in regulating the grid and making sure that overall balance is maintained.<\/p> <p>In terms of smart metering, current timescales indicate the cost-benefit analysis is due to complete in 2018, with installation starting at the end of 2021.  It is a project on which to drive forward with the regulator, ESB Networks and a number of other players.<\/p> <p>  I do not have anything to add to the commentary on the green bond that we had a couple of months ago.  It is primarily an area for Government policy to decide how the Government wants to support the retrofit of homes.  It is expensive.

I am given hope by what is coming down the line, in particular the fact that there will be a renewable heat incentive that will hopefully come into being towards the end of this year, in the fourth quarter.  That will have an impact on heat.  There are indications that we may see something on renewables in transport.  Efficiency is at the core.  If we can achieve greater efficiency between now and 2020, it reduces our ask in terms of renewable electricity and renewable gas to support that.  It is one of the most effective ways of decarbonising.  Energy efficiency helps to solve some of those issue and we should push harder for it.

There has been a lot of enthusiastic comment here on the directive improving things.  From Ireland's point of view, will someone explain to me what this directive will achieve that we could not achieve for ourselves?  Will it give new powers to our regulator?  Could we not get those powers by ourselves?  I note that it is stated there are no implications for subsidiarity.  If these are good ideas then is there some constitutional reason we are not doing them ourselves?<\/p> <p>  I want to have some clarity about modelling.  What economic modelling are we putting in place for all of this? Are there any extrapolations of Irish growth such as population growth and are they being built into our modelling?  Are we working towards Ireland growing constantly at 3% and 4% over the next ten or 20 years and what assumptions are we making? A subset of this question is that we are talking about a major transformation - we hope - from fossil fuelled vehicles to electric vehicles, at least for small and medium-sized vehicles.  Is the increased demand for electricity built into the model?  What are the implications of large-scale use of Ireland for data centres?  It is my understanding that they can be very significant consumers of electricity.  Maybe someone will explain that to me.<\/p> <p>  My last query is about the Celtic interconnector and is directed at Mr. Slye or Mr. Doyle.  It was said that the interconnector will not be built if there is no positive benefit for Irish consumers.  I presume cheaper electricity would be available or a more predictable electricity supply.  Is it the case that Ireland will not proceed with it unless prospective electricity prices in France appear to be significantly lower and the French are probably only interested in getting involved if there is going to be a good profit for them or a return on their investment?  I have looked at the figures and it appears that we have nearly 3,000 MW of wind power in Ireland at the moment and the major ESB and other electricity plants have capacity for another 2,500 MW.  The Celtic interconnector is to bring a 700 MW connection, which is less than the Moneypoint power station is currently supplying.  I would like someone to explain to me what this &euro;1 billion interconnector will bring that another Moneypoint would not?  Is French nuclear power the advantage of it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017022800002#H00400","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1488301200,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McDowell.

I have read the presentations and I have a few short questions.  When I read the ESB approach, and I would be interested to hear anyone else's view on it, effectively we are talking about 100% decarbonisation of our energy system by 2050.  Decarbonisation is what is what I read into it.  There are transport and agriculture elements, but that is our part of meeting the climate action goals.  Am I right on that?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses have said specifically in their written presentations that some of the proposals around biomass and capacity remuneration around the clean energy package may inadvertently limit member states' specific solutions.  I would be interested in hearing the details of what the witnesses are looking for in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I would appreciate it if the witnesses could outline their capital spend this year, the main items of expenditure and whether they applied for any funding from the Connecting Europe Facility, the European Investment Bank funding or the Juncker plan investment fund? We talk about these big retrofit programmes and so on but have the witnesses any specific projects where they are looking for funding from any of those European funding sources?<\/p> <p>  I was very interested that the SEAI said we may be looking at some solutions in renewable transport.  Will the authority indicate what we may be looking at?  Mr. Gannon mentioned it and perhaps he could expand on what we could be doing in renewable energy and transport.<\/p> <p>  I have two final questions, one of which is for the CER.  I seem to recall that we started doing the cost-benefit analysis on the smart metering programme in 2010.  Is the CER satisfied that it has taken us eight years to do a cost-benefit analysis? Is there a risk that Ireland is falling behind other countries in this consumer focused energy system, if it has taken Ireland eight years to just do a cost-benefit analysis, particularly given the ESB has done very detailed consumer surveys?  We have oodles of data, more than anywhere else.  Is the CER happy that it has taken eight years to do a cost-benefit analysis?<\/p> <p>  I have some questions also for EirGrid.  If we do not proceed with the North-South interconnector, is it feasible or possible that the Northern energy authorities may instead look for a grid interconnection across to Scotland or the UK to provide the energy security they may need? Has this ever been raised as a risk in the mix?<\/p> <p>  Last but not least, my vision is that if we had 100% decarbonisation of the energy system, the more interconnection we would have, the cheaper it would be.  It does not have to be curtailed.  It can be balanced and it is fundamentally the big picture.  We are going to go to with the north-western European and probably a wider energy balancing system with interconnection in all sorts of different locations.  Why is EirGrid not looking for other interconnectors with the UK in this regard? Is there a risk we will end up with private interconnectors and we would run into the same problems we had with the Midlands project in not getting the benefits of the balancing capability where a national transmission system operator can use it, as it has a different economic assessment because it has the wider societal and other balancing benefits?  Are we at risk of seeing private interconnection replacing the State investment in further interconnection with the UK?  I would be interested to know this, given that in the Connecting Europe facility, as I recall, about four or five interconnectors would have been funded between the UK and Ireland in the most ambitious ten-year plan.  Why have we not looked at the possibility of any further interconnection with the UK?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017022800002#H00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488301200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I will start with the points raised by Deputies Dooley and Stanley on deeper retrofit.  There are things we must look at very carefully.  This year, as opposed to prior years, where we would have looked at the number of retrofits in the tens this year, we are going to look at hundreds depending on how many we can get.  It is important we look at the different housing types in Ireland, the different archetypes, and the different technical solutions because there could be a number of ways of reaching a particular level of performance.  We would also look at the costs of that and how the consumer would finance it, whether a green bond or a grant-type programme.  We must ask what is the most cost-effective way of incentivising that and in getting consumers to a point where they are willing to invest in their homes for the price of a reasonably sized car.  That is not insignificant in itself.  The final piece is to test the supply chain.  Do we have the designers, the technologies to put into the homes, the trained men and the tools to do that, given that we have fewer than ten apprentice plasterers in the country at the moment?  We are significantly increasing our testing of that market and it will go on during the year.

While not necessarily redesigning the incentive, we have already started to look at getting greater impact from what we are doing with electric vehicles, including the electric vehicle grant scheme fleet.

Along with industry and other key stakeholders, many of whom are around the table, we went into a high level design process to ascertain how this smart metering project would work in Ireland.  We had a CBA rerun in early 2014 whereby we had a broadly neutral outcome and decided to continue to progress with the project.  Since then we have been very much into detailed design and delivery.  In the detailed design of the policy framework within which the smart meters would be rolled out and from the point of view of the ESB networks and the suppliers in the market, much more detailed analyses of the level of systems upgrades would be required and the mechanics of how it will work.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Peter O'Shea mentioned, we are coming to the point where the ESB will tender to procure the communications and the smart metering and the final CBA that was mentioned is really the last gate where we have real financial information coming through from a tendering process to test our CBA and demonstrate that this is going to deliver the benefits for consumers.<\/p> <p>  I would not describe myself as happy that it has taken this long, but I accept that this is an enormously complex and challenging project with a significant level of technical requirements.  The way we have designed this and the reason we have taken so much time at high level design and detailed policy design is that we want to ensure this project delivers for consumers.  In some of the other examples in the European Union, where projects have been rolled out it has been very much based on system operational type requirements to help with meter reads only or to address theft issues in Italy and it did not actually deliver the full benefits to consumers.  We have taken a lot of time and we have probably added some additional functionality to what we are looking for from the Irish smart metering project which has added to the complexity.

From our perspective, we see the decarbonisation of the electricity system as a two lap race.  The first lap is what we are doing at present, which is about of incremental growth in the existing renewable technologies.<\/p><p>We see that getting us to somewhere between 50% and 60% of the system some time in the next decade, perhaps the middle of that decade.  The second lap is much more difficult and this is what informs the perspective we take on the clean energy package.  There is not a silver bullet technology to deal with that second lap and take the other 50% from the system.  The large-scale technologies are the likes of carbon capture and storage, biomass, interconnection or unabated gas, although there are still significant issues with carbon with unabated gas.<\/p><p> The second stage of this journey is much more difficult to a large extent.  Our perspective on the directive is how to keep options open for Ireland.  The Deputy asked a question about biomass and there is some very positive stuff on biomass in the directive.  It focuses on quality biomass and how it is produced rather than used; how it is produced determines how sustainable it is.  That is partly related to the sustainability question and partly related to food chain impact.  It is a serious development at a European level and that is positive.  We see it as a concern that the draft directive would require that a biomass source would be coupled with a heat source in the same location.  That is a constraint we do not need right now; we do not need to answer the question right now so why put in that constraint at a European level?  Ireland has limited options as to how it can address the second lap of its race and from our perspective, we should keep options open rather than closing them.  The challenge here is too big to have options closed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017022800002#J02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488301200,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Will Mr. O'Shea deal with capital spend?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017022800002#K00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488301200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Our capital spend in a year is approximately &euro;800 million.

From our perspective, it asks what this means in terms of planning for the electricity system, both in terms of the type of generation portfolio and networks that are required and how think all of that will play out.  We published four draft scenarios and we have done much consultation with our colleagues around this table and in other parts of the industry before their publication.  The idea now is to do a number of workshops around the country and get stakeholder input to form what we believe are those scenarios.  They incorporate elements such as what we think about the take-up of electric vehicles and whether it will accelerate dramatically or continue at the same pace.  We have scenarios looking at both those options.<\/p> <p>  There is also the question of data centres and the extent to which they continue to come at the rate we have seen over the past two years.  We have worked very closely with IDA Ireland over the past two years on a number of projects by high-profile American companies.  These are the likes of Apple, Facebook and Amazon, Intel, Google and Microsoft.  They are all siting big data centres here and some of them are very large users of electricity.  Depending on the number, as Dr. Cotter pointed out, they have the ability to make a material difference to what one might think is the energy load to 2020, 2030 and beyond.  That is the scenario piece we launched only two weeks ago.  A consultation will now run for the next six weeks trying to get feedback on those scenarios and making sure we have captured all the key variables.  Our plans will be tested against those scenarios so we can ensure any plan for investment we might have is robust.  That is under way and it takes care of the various scenarios.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ryan had a question about North-South interconnection and what authorities in Northern Ireland would do in the event that it did not go ahead.  In the first instance there would be a very serious security of supply issue, for which they would need short-term solutions.  The Deputy queried whether an interconnector to Scotland would be one of those.  The timeline on that would be so far beyond what they would need in terms of security of supply as not to make it a solution for the next five or more years.  It may be a longer-term solution but the time horizon for delivering something of the scale of an interconnector to Scotland would be way beyond addressing the real and urgent security of supply that they have.  They have undoubtedly looked at all the possibilities, including commissioning, generation and other options, albeit with significant issues.<\/p> <p>  Before I speak about the Celtic interconnector, there was a question as to whether we examined other interconnectors to countries, with the obvious example being the United Kingdom.  In 2010, when we were well on the way to finalising the east-west interconnector, which runs from Meath to Wales, we did a feasibility study on what would be the next interconnector or interconnectors that we should look at.  We considered the UK and France.  The French interconnector looked more beneficial in terms of Irish consumers and the benefit to the country and we sought to engage with the French around that.  In the period since, some private developers came along and looked to build interconnectors between Ireland and the UK.  Some of that was tied up with the proposal in approximately 2012 of a renewables export from the midlands to the UK but that proposal in terms of interconnectors and renewables export has gone.  However, one of those developers is still pursuing the option of an interconnector between Ireland and the UK and looking at it as an option.  As there is a private developer looking at it and we are involved with the detailed work on a French interconnector, which our initial studies indicated was more valuable, we have continued to focus on that.<\/p> <p>  There is a project that has projects of common interest, PCI, status and the private company examining it would have it as an interconnector available for use in the system not tied to any specific generation.  That project is still there and that is why we focused on the French interconnector.  The French interconnector made sense before Brexit was even a twinkle in David Cameron's eye but it probably makes more strategic sense, given the vote of the British people in the middle of last year in terms of strategic importance to this island and the country.  That is where we are.  The Deputy mentioned the Cohesion Fund and the most allowed into any project is 50%.  All phases to date have been funded to that limit by the Connecting European facility.  We will continue to seek for them to fund it.<\/p> <p>  The Senator had a question concerning the Celtic interconnector and a potential comparison with Moneypoint, asking if &euro;1 billion for 700 MW made sense.  One way of looking at it is we will pay half, which means it is &euro;500 million for 700 MW.  A typical 450 MW combined cycle gas turbine, which is the best-in-class type of unit, will cost approximately &euro;450 million.  On a megawatts of available capacity basis, it is probably a slightly better option.  Celtic has the potential to deliver a number of benefits.  There is the ability to access cheaper power in France, and it has a fleet of base load nuclear plants that it intends to maintain.<\/p><p>They are going to move it down slightly in terms of overall share but it will still be 50%, so there is a cheaper base load.  There is also the ability to optimise the use of renewable resources here, so that, for example, when it is really windy we don't have to curtail wind power generation.  Instead of curtailing it, we can get revenue from it by selling it to the French.  There is also the security of supply benefit.  Because there is an interconnector there, there is potentially no necessity to build as much capacity on the island to ensure demand is served.  We must make sure that when all of those benefits are stacked up, that they outweigh the investment cost, and that it makes sense for Irish consumers.  We are acutely conscious that investment costs are certain, and sunk.  We need to make sure that the benefits which are projected out into the future will actually materialise.  It is a lot of money.  At the end of the day, it is Ireland and its consumers who are going to stand behind that, so we are acutely conscious of it.<\/p><p> Deputy Ryan mentioned the fuel mix in the future.  We are looking at different options.  If one thinks about how to get the power system up to 100%, there are only a number of levers available.  The level of instantaneous renewables that can be managed on the system can be increased.  We currently have it limited at 60%.  We are going to get to 75% by 2020.  If that can be pushed up, it will help.  The technical analysis to date has not shown how that can be done.  We can see how we can get to 75%.  We have some really good engineers.  We believe that it is possible to go beyond it, but we have not cracked that yet.  No one has done 60%, anywhere in the world, but we are doing it.
