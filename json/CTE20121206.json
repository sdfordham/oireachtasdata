We will meet the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Development Finance Agency to deal with these matters.

In 2011, central government funds provided to local authorities totalled just over &euro;3.5 billion.  That represented a reduction of more than &euro;900 million on the amount provided in 2010 and was down over &euro;2.2 billion from the peak in 2008.  Directly or indirectly the Vote for Environment, Community and Local Government provided &euro;1.3 billion to local authorities in 2011 and the Vote for Transport, Tourism and Sport provided &euro;1.2 billion.  A further &euro;561 million in non-Exchequer source funding was paid to local authorities from the local government fund.  Over the year, the local government fund has been financed mainly by motor tax receipts and an annual Exchequer contribution.  In 2012, the Exchequer contribution has been replaced by the proceeds of the household charge payable by owners of residential property.  This charge which is being collected by the Local Government Management Agency is an interim measure and is to be replaced by the property tax announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech.<\/p><p>  Just over one third of the centrally sourced funding was applied to road improvement and maintenance, with a further one fifth used for housing and urban regeneration projects.  The general purpose grants are provided to assist local authorities to bridge the gap between their other income and the cost of services they provide.  These also accounted for one fifth of the funding provided.  Chapter 16 also looks at the measures available to assess the performance of urban wastewater treatment infrastructure.  In the past decade over &euro;3 billion has been spent on wastewater infrastructure.  Overall responsibility for water services in the State lies with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, while the local authorities provide and maintain public water services.  The new commercial semi-State body, Irish Water is to take over that responsibility from the local authorities.  The 1991 EU Directive on Urban Waste Water required different levels of waste water treatment depending on the characteristics of the catchment area and the type of water body into which the waste water is discharged.  It also requires regular monitoring of the discharges from treatment plants.  The Environmental Protection Agency reports on the level of treatment in place and the performance of treatment plants which enables the level of compliance with the directive to be assessed.  However, the 2008 and 2009 data was published only in February 2012.  The data for 2010 was published in June 2012.  The usefulness of the data is reduced by the delay in publication but both the Department and the EPA have indicated that the causes of these delays have been addressed and from now on the performance data for any given year will be published by the end of the following year.<\/p><p>  Treatment plants where secondary treatment is provided can fail to meet the directive requirements for two main reasons, either because too few discharge samples are tested or because the samples failed to meet the quality standards.  In 2010, 94% of plants provided the required minimum number of test results.  Included in the 6% of plants that did not meet the testing requirements are five that did not submit any results to the EPA.  Just over 40% of plants did not meet the required minimum discharge quality standards.  Given the level of investment that occurred over recent years, there is a need to identify the causes of this and the corrective action required.  In addition in 2010 there were 18 catchment areas where the level of wastewater treatment required by the EU directive is not yet in place.  It is estimated that the required treatment will not be in place in all areas until 2015.  Information is not available on the cost per unit of waste water treatment which is a central aspect of performance.  The report recommends that the Department examines the feasibility of providing such costs measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012120600005#D02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354789800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>As requested by the committee, I provided a briefing paper in advance of this meeting.  Therefore, I will keep my opening comments short.  Chapter 6 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report for 2011 addresses financial commitments under public private partnerships.  As far as the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is concerned, PPP procurement is used in the water services sector where it is clearly established that the approach provides the best value for money overall.  Water services authorities are required to examine all procurement options in an even-handed manner and to undertake a public sector benchmark assessment before a decision is taken to progress to PPP procurement.  The initial assessment is based on securing the best value for money from a whole-life perspective, including the operation and maintenance costs in the post-construction phase.  If it is concluded that a water services scheme should be advanced as a PPP, the design, build, operate and maintain model, which is known as the DBOM model, is the preferred procurement route for new and upgraded water services treatment facilities on the basis of positive local and international experience and the high cost of traditional procurement in this area.<\/p><p>  Chapter 6 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report refers to the value for money review of the water services investment programme, which was carried out in 2010.  The value for money report supports the view that, based on experience to date, the DBOM model offers a number of advantages for projects involving the provision of water services infrastructure.  For example, it incentivises private sector contractors to optimise the whole-life cost of the project and to provide reliable treatment processes and technologies and associated mechanical and electrical equipment through single-point responsibility for design, construction, operation and maintenance.  It also leads to a better allocation of risk, resulting in greater certainty of final capital cost.  It encourages contractors to use newer technologies with associated technical and economic advantages.  It involves contractually guaranteed performance and maintenance standards over the 20-year operational phase.  Overall, the DBOM model ensures that the risks inevitably associated with large-scale infrastructure procurement are appropriately borne by the relevant stakeholders and the exposure of the Exchequer and the taxpayer to increased costs is minimised.  The data available to the Department continue to reinforce the position that for larger contracts, the DBOM model provides a significant reduction in capital and whole-life costs.  Chapter 6 gives details on 20 water services projects costing &euro;20 million or more which the Department is funding using the PPP approach.  They include two new projects - the Letterkenny wastewater treatment plant and the River Barrow water treatment plant - which reached contract stage in 2011.  The briefing paper we provided for this meeting gives an updated schedule of expenditure and commitments in relation to these 20 PPP projects.<\/p><p>  Chapter 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which concerns central government funding of local authorities, details the range of expenditure programmes for which local authorities are responsible.  It also draws attention to the reliance of local authorities on the Exchequer for funding through the Votes of a number of Departments, as well as other central sources.  Such funding amounted to &euro;3.5 billion in 2011, compared with &euro;4.4 billion in 2010.  The chapter also addresses performance measures in relation to urban wastewater treatment.  This material is based on reports published by the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year, which set out the results of local authority compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive and information on the licensing and authorisation regime introduced by the Waste Water (Discharge Authorisation) Regulations 2007-10.  The reports illustrate a number of areas where new infrastructure is required to ensure compliance with statutory limits.  This infrastructure is being provided through the Department's water services investment programme.  Irish Water will, over time, take over responsibility for investment in wastewater infrastructure and its operation.<\/p><p>  The report also provides an update on housing issues.  As the committee is aware, the land aggregation scheme concerns land acquired for social and affordable housing purposes that can no longer be utilised in the manner originally envisaged in light of current economic circumstances and the evolution of more flexible housing supply models.  The Department, the Housing Finance Agency and the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency are taking a structured approach to the unwinding of the overall liability - some &euro;500 million at the end of 2011 - over a reasonable period of time.  We made some changes to the operation of the scheme recently.  Up to this year, funding to redeem relevant loans was made available from the Department and HSC Limited was then responsible for the management and maintenance of lands transferred under the scheme.  Following a review of the scheme in 2012, the manner of loan redemption has been altered.  Instead of using capital moneys to pay off the loans of some authorities, all of the eligible matured loans will now be converted into mortgages of up to 25 years, with interest and capital payments being made by the housing authority to the Housing Finance Agency and the amount recouped by the Department.  The revised terms of the scheme were notified to local authorities in June 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012120600006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Tallon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354790400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>May we publish Ms Tallon's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012120600007#F00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354790400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012120600007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Tallon"},{"type":"speech","time":1354790400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.

We have fixed price contracting since 2007 and this provides a good basis for comparison.  Every wastewater treatment plant is, in a sense, customised to its location.  Many issues arise relating to the size of the collection system, the topography of the area, whether it is a pumped or gravity system, the type of treatment provided, the loading on the plant, the management of the loading into the plant, the form of sludge treatment or whether it is an inland or coastal plant.  There is a wide range of factors involved and the technology is complex.  Every assessment is done on a site specific basis, depending on the range of factors that applies in an individual location.

As the Secretary General has advised, based on the most recent data, that is about 1.1 million properties, therefore, the task is to seek to secure compliance in respect of the remainder; that is being done through a combination of means, but ultimately to identify liable properties.

Second, in terms of the completion of the database - this is an important foundation to a fully functioning property tax - a series of data sharing measures have been taken to try to build up the database.  On foot of that, the Deputy will be aware that letters were issued to a range of property owners to check whether they were already on the database by virtue of a slight difference in formulation of the address and, if not, to seek payment.

The question is how we can get that.

The provision of affordable housing and measures to increase supply had been a strong policy focus between 2004 and 2006 in particular.  Supply was increased in that period, but by the end of 2009, there was a residue of unsold affordable housing within the local government system.  At that stage, we had 3,700 unsold affordable housing units on the books.  We also had other units in the process of being provided, so there was an additional delivery of 480 affordable housing units in 2010 and a further 84 units in 2011.  In essence, we had more than 4,000 unsold affordable housing units in the system.<\/p><p>  Local authorities and the Department have had to take a pragmatic view as far as the use of affordable housing is concerned.  Our main approach has been to seek to transfer the housing units across to social leasing, that is, the provision of the houses to approved housing bodies for onward leasing.  Approximately 2,200 of the unsold affordable units have been absorbed into the social leasing scheme.  In areas where houses were not attractive or where we could not make a match in terms of social leasing, we have transferred those units into the main housing programme, that is, they have been transferred to local authority ownership.  Effectively, they have been bought as part of the social housing stock.  There are approximately 600 units which fall into that category.  A small number of sales of affordable housing units have continued to happen also.  At this stage, taking account of the numbers of units that are now in social leasing schemes, transferred to the social housing investment programme or sold, we have approximately 600 unsold affordable housing units still in the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012120600010#J01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Tallon"},{"type":"speech","time":1354792200,"counter":136,"content":"<p>How many people are on the social housing waiting list nationally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012120600010#J01400","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354792200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>At present, it is difficult to say how many are on the social housing waiting list.

It is coming from within capital assistance scheme and the leasing programme.  It is impossible to say for 2011 because there has been only one transaction.  The breakdown of the estimate for next year has not been fully finalised yet in terms of what is going into the capital assistance scheme and leasing.  Let us consider the average price of an acquisition - &euro;180,000.  The capital element provided by the Department would be approximately &euro;43,000.  The remaining balance would be drawn down as loan finance by an approved housing body.  There is a current cost associated with that in terms of the leasing.  That is how it would break down on a per unit basis.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked where the obstacles might lie.  It is important to bear in mind that it is a big decision.  Even if someone is at the end of their tether with mortgage arrears and has been struggling for some time, it is still a rather difficult transition for such a person to move from being a home owner to a tenant.  We have built a couple of cooling off periods into the system, one formal and one informal.  Applicants can waive their cooling off period but there is a 28-day period and a further period of approximately 40 days at different stages in the overall process.  That is one delay factor.  People need time to become conditioned to the idea that they will be losing ownership of their home.<\/p><p>  Moreover, it is difficult to say from the Department's perspective because it is not our specific remit to pressurise financial institutions to accept this.  It is being rolled out as part of the overall mortgage arrears resolution process, for which the Central Bank and the Department of Finance have responsibility.  All mainstream lenders are engaging with us and the Housing Finance Agency at this stage.  Almost all of them have brought forward possible cases for inclusion in the scheme.  The sub-prime lenders have been more active but I imagine it is easier for some of them, who do not envisage a future in lending in Ireland and therefore they may be quicker to initiate those end-of-the-line conversations with people.  There has been are reluctance by some institutions to have that difficult conversation with people and to say they believe a person's days as a home owner are numbered.  There was a certain reluctance to have that first conversation.  However, at this stage all the main lenders are engaged.  Now that we have gone through the process we know what is involved.  We are at an advanced stage with others and there will probably be some more completions this year.

We do go back after the event in an operational sense.  When I look at the operational figures for the DBO contracts and I see that in some cases the operational cost has decreased whereas in others it has increased, I am obliged to wonder why the latter is the case.  In some instances this results from an increase in the load or capacity into the plant and the fact that the contract allows for a charge per unit of capacity.  Local authorities are very good at monitoring that sort of operational aspect.  An authority must manage the collection network and the effluent discharge licences issued to particular commercial or industrial operators in an area.  These projects are very much a partnership between local authorities and plant operators.  Generally, the DBO applies to the treatment plant but it does not apply to the collection network.  That network has many implications for the treatment plant because the quality and loan of the effluent going in conditions both how the plant will perform and the cost of that performance.<\/p><p>  There are operational issues about which local authorities would be extremely concerned, particularly as they are responsible for paying contractors.

The benefit of this for many countries is that they can build a great many things but the cost does not appear on the national balance sheet.  Some of the companies that were involved in delivering projects of this nature obtained much larger profits than was anticipated.  In other instances, the loss to the taxpayer was a great deal higher than originally envisaged.

There are potential lessons to be learned at that point around what is in the design of the capital infrastructure put in place that might be valuable for projects that are procured traditionally.  One can take the benefit of some of the design element because often a decision can be made around investment in capital that would save on running costs.  If there are such lessons to be learned, one wants to pick up on them very quickly and incorporate them into traditional or conventional direct procurement.  Over the longer period, one can get a view in this respect.  Specifically, as in the case of the point we made about road projects, the assumption around demand for the project did not materialise.  There may be lessons one wants to learn from that about how one would design the next project.  One can only do that if one has a look-back review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012120600015#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1354795200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I will leave it at that.

I want to make a case that myself and others have made with regard to rateable town council areas, in my case, Dungarvan, and raise a factual situation that is problematic.  When Dungarvan Town Council is compared to the city and county councils, the two other rateable local authorities, the rates are much lower.  It is well run and has been well run for many years.  The administration of the local authority has done very well.  It has been effective with regard to its rate base and its commercial rate figures but it is now facing a potential equalisation of rates in the city and county councils, and it appears Dungarvan has the potential to increase its commercial rates.  It is worth thinking about that.  We raised that issue in different forums when this local government document was announced but we did not get much of an answer.  I got the impression that people had not thought about those town councils that had a low commercial rate number and because of the amalgamation the effective result would be that their rates would increase.  In some cases these town councils, and other Deputies have given examples from their constituencies, were well run and well administered.  It resulted in lower rates in that particular local authority.  It would be worthwhile for the Department to consider the effect of amalgamation and a difference in the scheme when it comes to the collection of commercial rates by local authorities.  It must be considered because efficiency will not be rewarded if those commercial rates go up.

An implementation committee is about to start work in regard to Waterford and I would expect that the kind of issue the Deputy raises will be a live issue in that context.  As Des Dowling has been directly involved in the Waterford situation, I might ask him to comment specifically on the point the Deputy made.

As the Deputy said, there are variations between the towns and the surrounding county and in part this is efficiency, but it is an indication also that this is where business often is located and where the rate base will be, and Dungarvan is a case in point.  There is variation around the country in that in some cases the town rate is higher than the surrounding county rate.  We have an opportunity in that regard, as the Secretary General stated.  The Waterford group is kicking off, so to speak, tomorrow.  I am going there to meet them as part of their first meeting and I will reinforce this point when I meet them.<\/p><p>  The Deputy can take it that the ambition, and again this is in the context of a difficult financial position generally, would be to try to harmonise around the lower rate where that is possible.  The Minister will be making allocations for next year very shortly but for last year, certainly in the Limerick case, the allocation was adjusted to try to ensure that Limerick City Council could bring down its rate closer to the county level.<\/p><p>  Within the constraints of resources available to us we would seek to reinforce merger processes and the particular issue the Deputy raised is a very serious one which we will have to see how we can manage.  It is not easy where there is a big gap between either a town or county or between a city and county that is merging but it is very necessary to do it.  It is hinged against, first, retaining a significant funding base for supply of services but, second, supporting and encouraging business in the area concerned, and rates are a big element of that.

From the perspective of a DBO, we have found that we have 20-year operational contracts.  These are contracts that do not allow for review or cost increase, other than by way of consumer price index, CPI, over the period of the contract.  Given that a contractor knows, when going into a DBO, that it must operate the contract for a 20-year period, there is a very large incentive from the outset to be highly efficient in respect of design, as well as with regard to the type of treatment and the plant operation.

However, now she tells us that the revenue generated from these contracts is not known to her and, therefore, not quantified by her or her Department and not factored into the whole life model.  That seems to be an incredible omission.  I am not in a position to make a judgment plant by plant or decision by decision.  However, I am alarmed that in the case of service infrastructure that generates revenue and profit - that is why these private operators are involved in the game - the quantum of profit is not calculated.  A balance needs based on common sense to be struck to see if it is the best value for money model for the State to manage, maintain and operate this infrastructure, or would it, in fact, make more sense for the private entity to carry it out?  The only way one can make that decision and have a fully thought out value for money appraisal is to have an understanding of the profit margins being generated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012120600020#T00900","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1354798200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012120600020#T01000","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1354798200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Certainly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012120600020#T01100","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1354798200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>The questions the Deputy has raised are as relevant to the agenda for for next week's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012120600020#T01200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1354798200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012120600020#T01300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354798200,"counter":332,"content":"<p>My office has not looked at the detail of the financial models that would underpin PPPs in the local authority area because I obviously do not have a remit in that regard.  We have looked at the financial models which are complex for other projects such as the courts complex near the Phoenix Park and the convention centre.  In these models one will see a profit element built into the costings for the public-private partnership side, often including developer costs and so on.  Therefore, the model is a construct before the off.  There would normally be an assessment, about which the committee would probably be able to talk to the National Development Finance Agency, of whether the cost elements built in were reasonable and seen to be so.  This should be properly weighed against the risks the private partner is taking.  What we do not and never can have a sense of is that as a purchaser of the project, one does not know what the profit outturn is for the developer.  I do not think there is any way one can know this.  One can re-examine what one thinks it should have cost when one sees how the project has unfolded.  One can re-do the value for money model, but one cannot know what are the private sector costs or whether it has made the profit included in the model, or more, or, in fact, whether it could have made losses.  I think there have been some losses in the United Kingdom.

To complete the remaining properties that we estimate are liable, we need a combination of further self-declaration by the individuals concerned or some data sharing whereby we have some information about the properties, but this information is not necessarily either comprehensive or up to date.

In 2005, a value for money audit was carried out on the Poolbeg incinerator proposal.  At that point, &euro;27 million had been spent on the project and nothing had been built but it was confirmed that the project represented value for money.  Two years later, another value for money audit was carried out and a further &euro;22.5 million had been spent with nothing built and the project still considered to be value for money.

We went through many of these issues when Ms Tallon appeared before the committee previously, and I will not go over them again, but it was only this year that light was finally shed on the costs of the project and where money has been spent.

On page 17, it states:<blockquote>[T]he financial management, as part of project management by the Environment and Engineering Department for this project, has been weak ... No proper classification of expenditure on an invoice basis was available to account for monies spent on this project at the initial audit stage (April 2012) ...

It went into some detail with regard to the costs and we discussed it at the time.  I stated it raised more questions than it answered.  I am sure Ms Tallon saw the correspondence before it was issued but I know she will not remember it.  I have a copy in front of me and I will go through a couple of the points in it.<\/p><p>  While the audit report discusses money spent it does not question enough of the areas in as much detail as I would like.  Under the first heading, a bulleted list is provided for client representative costs.  This list includes the preparation of various reports including PPP assessment, procurement of a design model, and the development and implementation of a public consultation and information strategy.  The correspondence sent to us by the Department mentions stakeholder consultation and public relations and other costs with regard to public awareness, other consultancy design, market soundings and the cost of a public awareness office in Ringsend.  When I see the bill for &euro;25 million for client representative costs under one heading which includes public consultation and information strategy, and I see a separate bill for just over &euro;4 million also including all of these things, I am concerned about duplication or the project being seen as a potential cash cow by certain people who can get money for all types of things without properly explaining themselves.<\/p><p>  Prior to Ms Tallon sending this correspondence to the committee was there a discussion about the various items detailed?

When Ms Tallon attended the committee previously, she told us we would have the report from the local audit unit after the summer.  August was the deadline for the final extension of the contract, but it has been extended yet again into the first quarter of next year.  Ms Tallon has told us that the Department is considering the matter, that she is concerned, that the Department has an interest but no responsibility and that she will revert to us with more details in the first quarter of next year.<\/p><p>  I am concerned that the project is running away from us like a freight train towards a cliff.  People are trying to stop it, but it seems to be out of control.  As the Committee of Public Accounts, we need to have a proper handle on the matter.  As stated at this and the previous meetings, the project is a significant one.  It is not just another project undertaken by a local authority.  For this reason, we need to be fully apprised of all of the details as they become known.  Of course councillors have responsibility, but we do as well, given the fact that Exchequer funding - taxpayer's money - has been committed, including in the form of centrally provided funds to local authorities.

He stated: \"The Waste to Energy Project has proved extremely challenging indeed more challenging than other controversial projects that the Environment and Engineering Department has been involved in such as the Regional Waste Water Treatment Plant.\"  This refers to the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant, which has gone over time and over budget by more than &euro;40 million and has been a significant imposition on constituents.<\/p><p>  We are told in black and white that the projects are being run by the same section of Dublin City Council.  They are significant for the Dublin region.  As we know from the private partners, the incinerator is not just for Dublin but for the country as a whole.  Both projects are experiencing significant problems.  Ms Tallon, as the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, has an interest in them.  If we do not comply with certain EU directives or guidelines, we will face considerable fines.  This is an issue for Ms Tallon and the Minister.

No one in the area, elected or non-elected, believes they should be used.  Currently, there is no private financing for them.

Ms Tallon stated that she had concerns and an interest, but she also has responsibility.  The committee must keep this project on its radar until it is concluded and finally, I hope, put to bed.

This discussion will allow members to gain an understanding of the Government's position on the issue and some of the priority areas on which decisions will be made.  I hope the meeting will focus on some of the specific issues that arise from the sustainability impact assessment, rather than having a general discussion on fishing and the European Union as this sometimes gives rise to a particular type of discussion on quotas.  I hope also that the joint committee will provide some information as regards its key priorities for December.<\/p><p>  The annual fishing opportunities for the Community's fishing fleets are traditionally agreed at the December Fisheries Council.  This year, the arrangements for 2013 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 18<sup><\/sup>to 20 December.  The levels of total allowable catch, TAC, and quotas for Ireland will again be determined at the meeting following negotiations with member states and the European Commission.  The Fisheries Council will also decide on the fishing effort, which determines days spent at sea, available for the Irish fleet in the Irish Sea and off the north-west coast for 2013.<\/p><p>  The process of preparing for the Council is now well under way with the publication of detailed proposals for TACs and quotas of key stocks of interest to Ireland in October.  The proposal covers stocks which are not subject to third party international agreements and are, in the main, whitefish and prawn stocks.  The Commission's proposals are based on formal advice received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES, which is the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks.  The Commission also takes account of the views of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice.  The basis of the advice provided by the ICES has changed in recent years.  In 2012, in response to a request from the Commission, the ICES has addressed the issue of providing quantitative advice where a precise assessment may not have been possible.  In the most extreme data limited cases where the exploitation pressure and stock status is unknown, ICES advises a 20% reduction in catch relative to the average catch of the previous three years.<\/p><p>  To inform my negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, I have had an assessment undertaken of the impacts of the Commission proposal.  The preparation of a sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment is provided for in the programme for Government.  To facilitate and inform these deliberations an open consultation process was initiated, whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2013.  On 2 November, an online web portal, <i>fishingnet.ie,<\/i> was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.  In addition, I convened a meeting of stakeholders on 15 of November, which provided a further opportunity to key stakeholders to outline their position on the many aspects of this proposal.  In all, nine submissions were received by the closure date and the full content of all the submissions received by the deadline are to be found on the website.<\/p><p>  When one considers the various contributions to the consultation process, there is a general acknowledgement that the national consultative process is a positive addition to the debate.  While acknowledgement is made of improvements in recent years in respect of stocks, particularly in the Celtic Sea, there is understandable concern about the poor state of certain whitefish stocks targeted by the Irish fishing fleet.  I agree with the sentiment in many of the contributions, which call for greater adherence to the scientific advice available to enable prudent and appropriate management decisions to be taken.  However, one criticism, which I share, is that of the arbitrary cuts proposed by the European Commission for fishing opportunities in 2013 and the narrow view taken on the use of scientific advice.  There is justifiable concern that these cuts in certain quotas will only lead to further discards.<\/p><p>  The Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara have undertaken an evaluation of the Commission's proposal which is contained in the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment, copies of which has been circulated to members.  The impact assessment acknowledges that while many stocks in which the Irish fleet have an interest are not in a healthy biological state, there has been an improvement in 2012 on the state of the resource base in respect of pressure and state indicators.  Of the 59 stocks in which Ireland has a share of the EU total allowable catch, 42% are now fished below the fishing maximum sustainable yield, MSY, compared to 36% in 2011.  The position is, therefore, improving.  The state of the resource base in terms of the biomass, that is, the population of mature fish in the stock, has also improved, with 34% above the trigger level set, an increase of 8% on last year.  The number of depleted stocks has declined from 12 to eight and 14% of stocks are assessed to be depleted.  The number of stocks with unknown biomass, no assessments or undefined trigger levels remains relatively high at 51%.  This is because we have a large number of fishing stocks for which it is almost impossible to obtain the data required to make assessments maximum sustainable yields.<\/p><p>  It is also noted that the activities of the fleet have other impacts on the wider marine ecosystem.  Greater efforts are necessary to achieve a more harmonious and eco-friendly interaction with the broader environment and ensure compliance with European environmental directives.  These efforts will be required to be imposed at European level on all EU fleets fishing in shared fisheries under the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  This is an area that will receive attention during the CFP reform process.<\/p><p>  I stick to my frequently stated view that decisions on setting total allowable catches should be informed by the science available.  However, I am opposed to blanket rules on so called &quot;data poor&quot; stocks requiring automatic reductions of 20%, even where the quantitative information available shows that the stock is being fished sustainably and the biological indicators are positive.  I do not intend to engage in a stock by stock discussion as the specific details are available in the document, which has been laid before the D&aacute;il, and the accompanying stock book, which was prepared by the Marine Institute.  However, I am prepared to address any specific issues on individual stocks that members may wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120600003#B00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354786800,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for a comprehensive presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120600004#C00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1354786800,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation and acknowledge the officials from the Department.

Perhaps we should pursue a different tactic and try to right some of the historical wrongs done to the Irish fishing industry since our entry into the European Union.  Perhaps we could achieve more in terms of protecting our fishing industry rather than seeing it cut constantly by adopting a tactic on the proposed measure and highlighting it consistently.  Perhaps we could rebalance some of the disparities in terms of what we can access in our waters, as opposed to what other fleets can catch in our waters.<\/p><p>  Some of the proposed cuts are startling, particularly the 21% reduction for white fish and prawns, the 12% reduction in the Celtic Sea and the 44% reduction in the Irish Sea.  However, we know that it will not end up as bad as that, because of the negotiation process that takes place.  The Minister did a very good job last year and held out for as much as he could and we expect he will do the same again this year, because he is committed to the development of the fishing industry.  This process highlights how this system works and how false it really is.  The scientific evidence is given, the Commission puts out its proposals and there is a lot of toing and froing.  We need to look at a different way of doing it and to consider rebalancing it so that Ireland can achieve some real benefits from the stock and potential we have.  I understand this is a difficult task and that it will be hard to achieve, but if the Minister does not start on that road, he will not be able to achieve the aim of protecting the industry as much as possible.<\/p><p>  With regard to the herring quotas, the management plan for the northwest is welcome.  There will be some reductions in the initial years, but the plan will pay dividends in the long run, as can be seen from the experience in the Celtic Sea.  It is good the industry has put forward proposals on this and that the plan has been accepted.  It is the only way forward, but will probably involve a few years of reductions<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120600005#D00800","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354788000,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy Harrington and then allow the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120600006#E00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1354788000,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I am not a member of this committee but I am very pleased to have heard the presentation from the Minister.  Obviously, every year the Minister and his officials go through this tortuous process of negotiating the total allowable catches, primarily based on a proposal from the European Commission on the back of scientific advice and the strategies this country needs to adopt to maintain a sustainable industry.  It is the less glamorous side of an industry that is not very well understood in this country.  This exercise this morning might add to our understanding and enhance the process.<\/p><p>  The Minister is going to a meeting about which there will be very little reporting, discussion or comment, except in some of the communities mentioned, where people will be firmly focused on what can be achieved because their livelihoods are dependent on the outcome of that meeting.  They will take very seriously the decisions that are made before Christmas.  We are dealing with a part of the industry that is rarely spoken about, that is, the whitefish sector.  That is possibly the most challenging part of the industry, where we have mixed fisheries with very good scientific advice on some species, but precious little advice on others which are very important to peoples' livelihoods.  The idea of an arbitrary 20% cut in total allowable catches for species about which we have no scientific information is unacceptable.  I support the Minister's contention that these must be dealt with differently.<\/p><p>  I also support the Minister in his view that steps must be taken, where there is scientific advice, to ensure the stocks of certain species are not being challenged or depleted.  Such steps are not just about appeasing the scientists, however, and that message must be sent out clearly.  Steps must be taken to sustain fishing communities in the longer term and should be seen as intergenerational decisions rather than short-term decisions for which politicians are frequently criticised.  When decisions are made and agreements are signed, the Minister must be conscious of the heavy impact they will have on people's livelihoods.<\/p><p>  It is very easy to make the case for tearing up the relative stability agreements that have been made, but we would need to walk away from the European Union, and even if we did, we would still have international fisheries agreements that would have to be honoured.  We must be very nuanced and strategic in our approach in trying to agree the total allowable catches.  We must take the best scientific advice available and use it to the best advantage of our fishing communities.  It is very easy to say, on entering total allowable catches negotiations, that we will achieve a better outcome than what the Commission proposes.  Just because that is what has happened in the past does not mean that it can be achieved in a few weeks' time.  Concessions are not just handed out on a plate and I would be very anxious that the Minister would acknowledge the fact that this is not a done deal.  There will be a battle and a decision may well be finalised at 5 a.m. after 18 or 20 hours of negotiations.<\/p><p>  It infuriates some of the fishing communities that visiting fleets can fish at will - or at least that is the perception - because they have larger total allowable catches, especially in species like monkfish, for example.  I hope the Minister understands that it causes great frustration when the Irish fleet is precluded from fishing a species because of quota while vessels from neighbouring countries are free to do in Irish waters what the Irish are prohibited from doing.  When the Minister goes into the negotiations and argues on the basis of scientific advice but is faced with quota restrictions or reductions in the total allowable catch, he must accept that the inevitable outcome of that, as sure as night follows day, will be greater discards, which will add to an already complex problem.<\/p><p>  The problem of discards has been highlighted in the south east recently but what has happened there is not the solution.  I am quite pessimistic regarding some of the stocks but I would hope that the Minister and his officials can convince the European Commission and their colleagues that swingeing cuts in one species will add to difficulties in terms of increasing the level of discards.  The Commissioner has made the elimination of the discards problem in all fisheries a priority but the challenge is particularly acute in the whitefish sector and I am not sure that is well understood at a European level.  Indeed, I am not sure it is even well understood in the fishing industry itself.  Leaders of the industry have certainly identified the problem and perhaps they could propose new solutions.  Technical measures can go some way to addressing the issue but it is a very complex problem.<\/p><p>  I wish the Minister and his officials well in the negotiations and urge them to resist the blanket 20% cut for the species about which there is inadequate scientific information.

If he has any further questions on the herring management document, once he has had a chance to read it, he can contact us and we will be happy to answer them.<\/p><p>  On the herring issue, we had to apply some allocation criteria and could not simply allow a free-for-all in terms of allowing everyone who wanted to catch herring in the Celtic Sea to do so just because the quota had increased.  Had we done that, we would very quickly have gone back to where we were four or five years ago when the stock was decimated.  There had to be some way of limiting numbers and we believe the way we did it was the fairest.  I would point out that we intend to apply the exact same rules to the north-west herring stock when that fishery recovers.  That means it will be the people who have catches in the historical reference years who will have priority for that area.  Let us wait until we see what happens there but I have no doubt there will be people who will be equally upset that they will not be allowed into that fishery when, assuming proper management, we see quota increases similar to those in the Celtic Sea.  All we can do is be consistent and that is what we are trying to do with both north-west and Celtic Sea herring.  It just so happens that everyone wants to get into the Celtic Sea at the moment because that is where the fish are, or rather where the quota is.  Many people would say the fish numbers are starting to grow in the north west and I hope that is true.<\/p><p>  Like Deputy Pringle, I would love to be able to change the relative stability agreements.  The fact that Ireland, in tonnage terms, catches 23% of the quota in the waters for which we are responsible but only gets 18% of the value is not something with which I am happy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120600006#E00600","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354789200,"counter":561,"content":"<p>The Minister's replies have covered much of what I had wanted to raise.

We hope to show that this is a fish with a cyclical pattern of increase and decline every five or seven years in order to demonstrate that this is not a declining fish stock.  I refer to a fascinating book which Deputy Noel Harrington might enjoy reading over Christmas.  The years 1994, 2002 and 2009 show a significant breeding recruitment.  We are now seeing the returns from the 2009 recruitment with an increase in the numbers of adult fish.  However, we are not permitted to catch them because a new recruitment is not imminent, according to the scientific analysis.  These are the technical arguments we will take up with the Commission in a couple of weeks' time.  We will argue that a pragmatic solution is required.  We will invite the Commission to examine the history of the stock over the past ten years and to arrive at a practical decision that does not result in perfectly good marketable mature fish being thrown over the side next year.  Using the data about last year's recruitment levels to make decisions this year does not make much sense.<\/p><p>  The main problem with the ICES, International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, calculations is incomplete data for some of the stocks.  As a result, a precautionary approach is adopted by ICES and an automatic cut of 20% is applied.  If complete data is not available then decisions should be made on the basis of the limited data that is to hand rather than the application of an arbitrary and automatic cut.  If I have to ask the fishing industry and communities to make difficult decisions on the basis of cutting stocks because there is scientific evidence to show the need for that, then when scientific evidence shows that a cut is not justified, that needs to be respected.  It cannot be both ways; cutting stocks when the evidence shows they should be cut while also cutting stocks when there is no evidence to show it is necessary.  There may be some limited scientific evidence to suggest there is no need to cut stocks.  I am all in favour of conserving stocks to ensure a future for our industry but I am also interested in ensuring that this only happens when scientific justification is available.  These are difficult times in Ireland.  We should encourage the sustainability and commercial value of our fish stocks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120600009#H00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1354789800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister well in the negotiations on 18 and 19 December.

Some of the countries involved have TACs which allow them to fish in Irish waters.  With the exception of fishing for boarfish and tuna, our pelagic fleet is generally tied up in port in the summer.

I accept, however, that one does see large Dutch vessels off the west coast at times.  That is, of course, an issue.  Ireland cannot take a unilateral decision to shut down fisheries.  These are seen as EU waters for which Ireland has responsibility.  As a result, there would need to be an EU policy in respect of Irish waters and that would need to be negotiated at Council level.  That might prove difficult.  I am happy to consider all of these matters.  Ultimately, this relates to trying to manage a stock that is by far the largest - in terms of value - to the fishing industry.  These matters must be resolved at European level.<\/p><p>  Coastal states negotiations are currently taking place in Bergen between the EU and Norway in the context of trying to agree a quota allocation for mackerel.  I suspect that agreement will be reached in this regard in the coming days.  The Commission has been stating that it must go beyond 15% in order that it will have the moral and legal authority to introduce trade sanctions.  In my view we can, from a legal standpoint, move ahead with trade sanctions without it going beyond 15%.  That is just a difference of opinion I have with the Commissioner.  The most important aspect of this matter is that we must stick with Norway.  Whatever is agreed in respect of TAC reductions should be the same in Norway as it is in the EU in order that we will not disadvantage ourselves versus other countries.  Together, we can ratchet up the pressure on the Faroe Islands and Iceland to come to the table and reach a negotiated settlement.  Iceland has shown some willingness in this regard but the Faroes have shown none at all.  In my opinion, this represents a really reckless approach towards a very valuable stock.

Hydrocephalus literally means water on the brain.  It is a condition in which water is retained in the brain and, as it cannot escape, it therefore puts pressure on the brain and cause some brain damage.  Although it can be treated with the insertion of a shunt, unfortunately quite an amount of damage already can have been done by the time it is diagnosed.  If members will give me the opportunity, I wish to tell them my story and that of my daughter, Hannah.  She is 14 years of age and was born in 1998 with hydrocephalus but thankfully not with spina bifida.  She had what is called a Dandy-Walker cyst, which is a cyst at the base of the brain that blocked the fluid from getting out, which was the problem.  Three days after birth, she had a shunt inserted in Crumlin hospital, as it was necessary to do it very quickly.  She lived with her shunt quite successfully for ten years without great problems or major issues.  I joined the organisation at some time during the interim and became more aware of, and got more information on, the condition of hydrocephalus.<\/p><p>  However, one day in 2008, Hannah became ill.  She was not feeling well, as often is the case with children, and we did not panic too much.  However, at about noon that day we decided she was not getting any better and that it would be best to bring her to our local accident and emergency unit.  On presenting there, luckily the staff there reacted quickly and sent her for a scan, at which it was established there was a blockage in the shunt and the fluid was building inside her head.  Within four hours of having arrived at our local accident and emergency unit, my daughter was transferred to Crumlin hospital and by 4 p.m., we were in an emergency operation situation there.  It was necessary to bring in the crash team because Hannah literally had left us.  Luckily, she returned to us and was rushed into theatre where she was operated on.  In a procedure that took approximately two and a half hours, the operating team righted the problem and got the shunt to work again.  Unfortunately, more damage had been done by then and Hannah suffered paralysis on her left side.  If members are familiar with anyone who has suffered a stroke, the effect was very similar to that.  She had paralysis on her left side, her left hand and left leg became very weak and all that went with that.<\/p><p>  This experience was a major trauma for us.  It took approximately four days before she came out of the anaesthetic and we literally were traumatised by the entire event.  She remained in Crumlin hospital for approximately seven weeks, where ultimately she was undergoing occupational therapy and physiotherapy services, as well as availing of all sorts of other hospital services.  As the hospital had done all it could for her by then, the only thing to do was to move her out to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where she spent a further eight weeks in rehabilitation.  This happened on 8 August and we eventually got her home on 23 December 2008.  Hannah has had further issues since then.  In 2010, she experienced another blockage and she ended up in Beaumont Hospital, where that was relieved.  Thankfully, Hannah is doing well.  She is attending a special school, is learning, and is doing all the things.  It is like Ms Hazel McGeough's comment about her client in that she has all the aspirations to be a model and to be everything little girls want to be when she grows up.  Please God, perhaps someday she will achieve that goal.<\/p><p>  As a family, we could not have survived without the support we received from Spinal Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland, SBHI.  I have become much more involved in SBHI in the intervening years and as Mr. George Kennedy already has noted, I now am proud to be vice chairman of the national organisation.  That is my story and that is what hydrocephalus can do.  It literally is a life and death situation.  When the doctor emerged from the operation that night in Crumlin, he told us the surgical team had saved Hannah by a hair's breadth.  That brings it home to one how close one can be.  When I left my house this morning, my daughter was fine but by this evening, the whole situation could change.  I again thank members were listening and hand them back to Mr. George Kennedy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012120600005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Landy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354787100,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Landy.  I will provide members with a brief history of our organisation, which has been in existence since 1968 and is not just a recent innovation.  We have branches throughout the country and service 26,000 square miles of land area with seven family support workers.  We have a brief that covers matters such as education, medical issues and schools.  We advise our members on a constant basis and probably have 4,000 primary members who have either or both of these conditions.  Not alone do we work with our members directly but we also work with their siblings, the direct family and perhaps even grandmothers and grandfathers and our total staff comprises 17 people.  I reiterate that Ireland has the highest rate of spina bifida and hydrocephalus in the world.<\/p><p>  The organisation has four main requirements.  First, we seek a consultant paediatric urologist and in a few minutes, Ms Edel Browne will go through the history of the broken promises in respect of this particular service, which is an absolute necessity for our young children.  Our second priority is to seek the possible appointment of a research nurse to work in Temple Street hospital.  In addition, we seek the provision of a defined clinic for adults who have the condition.  Finally, two areas of the country badly need family support.  For instance, we have no family support in place in counties Galway, Sligo or Donegal.  In these three areas, there are approximately 200 primary people who have the condition but who do not have our support.  At present, we have a family support worker in place on a temporary basis in the Cork-Kerry region.  However, members should be advised there is a possibility that this service will be withdrawn on 31 December.  I note this service is at present operating at a cost to the State of less than &euro;50,000.  To explain a little more clearly our main requirement, namely, the consultant paediatric urologist, I invite Ms Edel Browne to go through the needs and the situation that pertain at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012120600005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. George Kennedy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354787700,"counter":592,"content":"<p>The main point on our list of objectives that we want to discuss with the committee is the immediate need for a consultant paediatric urologist.  As it stands now, children with spina bifida are not receiving any urological review by a consultant urologist in Temple Street.  Since 2009, approximately 300 babies have been born with a neural tube defect, including children with spina bifida.  Prior to 2009, children born with spina bifida were transferred to Crumlin.  Since 2009, however, all children with neural tube defects have been attending Temple Street.  At this point in time, there is a consultant paediatric urologist in Crumlin hospital, but due to the demands and restrictions on him, and the level of children who need urological care, he is no longer able to see any children with spina bifida, apart from extreme situations.  He is no longer able to review any children with spina bifida, so our children are not being reviewed or receiving any follow up.  As of now, there are 300 babies, toddlers and young children who are receiving absolutely no urological reviews.<\/p><p>  Children with spina bifida do have continence issues as a result of their condition.  This is a huge issue we have with our children and we want to see an improvement in the quality of their lives.  In many cases, children with spina bifida are moving through their younger years but their continence needs are not being examined.  They are heading into their school years wearing nappies and pads because no alternative treatment is available to them.<\/p><p>  To highlight this issue somewhat better for the committee, I will tell a story about a child with whom I am working at the moment.  He is an eight year old boy from Dublin who has been attending Temple Street.  He had surgery at birth to operate on the lesion on his spine.  He has never been reviewed by a urologist in Ireland, so he was using nappies full-time to address his bladder issues.  He went into third class in September.  He is fully aware of his continence issues and how they make him stand out from his peers, as one would be aware for an eight year old child.  He was using a wash-out procedure in order to irrigate his bowel so his bowels were under control.  That is a big social issue for any eight year old if they are to have such accidents.  The nappies or pads were being used solely for the bladder.<\/p><p>  In March this year, Temple Street had prioritised John for the treatment abroad scheme to travel to St. George's Hospital in London to be reviewed by a urologist.  His family were prepared for major bowel and bladder surgery there.  The information was given and I supported the family through this transition before travelling abroad for both major invasive surgeries.  After travelling abroad in March, he came home after a week following tests, scans and an overview by the urologist in London.  A week after he came home, I received a telephone call to say that the urologist had said there was no way John was to be operated on because he was not suitable before less invasive treatments were done first.  <\/p><p>  To take a step back, the point is that if there had been a urologist in Temple Street, he or she could have undertaken these simple tests and scans here.  A simple procedure such as passing a small catheter tube into the bladder to release urine, which is less invasive and easily done, could have been taught here by a specialist nurse.  If that could have been done here it would have saved the State a huge amount of money.  That was the first case of a child who was sent away under the treatment abroad scheme back in March.  <\/p><p>  Children with spina bifida are in the high risk category of irreversible kidney damage as a result of the neural rube defect they are born with, which in time can lead to end-stage renal failure and possible death, if not monitored on an ongoing basis.  Urology is not an additional option for our children's care, it is a necessary part of the care they need right through life.  Kidney failure is a disaster but is predictable and preventable.  If their kidneys are adequately monitored, it can be totally prevented.  We are aware that an additional urology post has been in the pipeline since 2009 following the transition to Temple Street, but there has been no satisfactory outcome for our children. <\/p><p>  I attended the meetings along with Mr. George Kennedy at the HSE since the transition to Temple Street.  The funding has been prioritised but the post has not been filled.  The story has been the same since 2009.  The promises are there but we are anxious as a national organisation to see this progression for our members.  We are working alongside our parents and are doing as much as we can.  We really want to see a positive move towards appointing a urologist to provide the important care our children need and deserve.  We do not want to see children who are born now, ending up with end-stage renal failure in a couple of years' time because there is no monitoring for them.  Given the level of care that children got ten years ago in Crumlin Hospital, we have taken a step backwards when it comes to urological care for children with spina bifida.  It is extremely difficult to watch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012120600006#E00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel Browne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354787700,"counter":593,"content":"<p>On the chronological side of that particular case, we were told on 30 March 2009 that this position was in the pipeline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012120600006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. George Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1354787700,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Told by whom?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012120600006#E00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354787700,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Told by the HSE.

The association's requests are well justified and I hope that the committee can further pursue the issues, particularly the filling of the post.  I have a particular and special interest in fibromyalgia and that is why I am here today.  If truth be known, I could probably answer all of the questions that have been asked but I will not do so - that is why the group is here.  However, I want to make a number of points.<\/p><p>  The issue of early intervention is something that needs the attention of the Department.  As Mr. Maher correctly pointed out, people are sent from pillar to post, in some cases for up to three or four years, before they are diagnosed.  That has serious consequences and creates difficulties for sufferers, both in the physical and mental state.  By the time they are diagnosed, they are very far down the road and recovery is much more difficult.  As part of what the association is doing in requesting for this to be listed as a long-term illness with the Department, it should also request resources for early diagnosis.<\/p><p>  General practitioners, unfortunately, as is the case with every patient who presents himself or herself to a general practitioner's clinic, have probably five to ten minutes to give to him or her, and this illness cannot be diagnosed in five to ten minutes.  It takes a long time to diagnose it.  It takes a person to be sent in the right direction.  There are some excellent rheumatologists in this country who can diagnose fibromyalgia.<\/p><p>  There is an argument, which has been put up by the HSE and the Department of Social Protection, that people are using this as a way of going on to long-term illness.  There is a specific diagnosis for this illness.  It can be diagnosed quickly by the correct person.  We need to ensure that such is put in place for everybody who presents with the symptoms to his or her general practitioner.<\/p><p>  While I commend the spina bifida organisation on its ability to organise at national level and to get recognition, this organisation, Fibromyalgia Sufferers of Ireland, FSI, is embryonic.  FSI has not yet got official recognition.  It needs to get official recognition and it needs official supports.  These people are trying to do it off their own bat.  I welcome that the committee has agreed to write to the relevant Minister and the Department for this to be officially recognised as a long-term illness, but I would also call for the supports that are necessary.  Those members of the delegation and the wider group cannot continue to provide these supports on a voluntary basis.  They need official supports.<\/p><p>  The other point I would make relates to early intervention.  It is essential for sufferers to be diagnosed early on and for the resources to be put into that because in the longer term, it will save the State a great deal of money.  If somebody is diagnosed early, he or she can live with this and continue to play a role in society in terms of the workplace.  If he or she is not, unfortunately, as Mr. Maher outlined, there are consequences.<\/p><p>  I thank Mr. Maher, Ms Bromley and the others who have come here today, and, indeed, those from Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland.  I hope to meet my namesake, Mr. Peter Landy, for coffee later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012120600008#G00600","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1354788600,"counter":607,"content":"<p>Like Senator Landy, I am not a member of the committee and I thank the Chairman for giving me an opportunity to speak at the committee today.  I thank the committee for inviting both groups, in particular the fibromyalgia group with which I have been involved directly in my area in Carlow for almost a year.<\/p><p>  Approximately a year ago, I first became involved with the group.  Prior to that, I would have been, like Deputy Dowds, very ignorant of what fibromyalgia was.  I was shocked and horrified, to be quite honest, to discover the number of people who are sufferers of fibromyalgia in the small area of Carlow.  There could be up to 100 persons of whom I became aware in that time.  The consequences of their issues, which have been well outlined by Mr. Maher and, more recently, Senator Landy, are striking.<\/p><p>  I have a couple of points to make.  There is the cost of drugs.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned, there is the cost of all involved and the diagnosis.  There is a direct link between the two.  When one goes for a diagnosis and one is unaware of what is the problem, straightaway the patient is put on some kind of medication that may not be necessary, and that involves a substantial cost to the State.  That is continually progressed all along without getting a definite diagnosis of what is the position.  Apparently, medication is not required in most cases.  I would concur with previous speakers, that there must be a process in which early intervention is essential, and in getting appropriate diagnosis to eliminate the medication that is not required.<\/p><p>  Have the groups any idea of the number of sufferers in the country?  The point has been made that the gender breakdown is 87% women, 13% men.  Have they any idea of the overall figure?<\/p><p>  I thank the committee for inviting the two groups, in particular,the fibromyalgia group.  This is an important step for them along the way.  They definitely deserve official support and recognition which they have not received to date.  They make a strong case.

The other main reason - I can speak for myself as a man - is that, as the committee will be aware, a man will not go to the doctor.  A man will not talk about his problems.

We have described fibromyalgia as a neurological problem that comes from over sensitisation of the muscles and extremities.  Technically, therefore, we should be seen by a neurologist as opposed to a rheumatologist.  All of us are aware of the pressures under which the limited number of neurologists in this country must work.  People with fibromyalgia need to be very lucky to have a GP with knowledge and awareness of the disorder to be referred to a rheumatologist who can make the official diagnosis.<\/p><p>  There is no cure for the syndrome, which involves a series of varying symptoms and ailments, but drug medication should not be condemned because it is very effective for many people.

I would say definitely not because that is far down the line.  Going on current statistics, on average, one baby is born every week with spina bifida in this country.  That is too high a risk to take with these babies.  We cannot risk these babies having irreversible kidney damage, and, therefore, we have to be proactive.  We are taking a chance with the 300 babies who are there at this stage.  Add a baby who will be born this week, next week and the week after and every week for another three or four years before a new hospital is in place.

If the State does not function on the basis of law, that is a threat to the democratic nature of the State.  This committee was designed to oversee public service delivery.  We note from the Ombudsman's presentation that for years Ombudsmen delivered information to the Houses of the Oireachtas and for years that information was flouted.

Is it the case that the Minister is in conflict with the HSE?  The HSE has accepted and is about to deliver in this respect but the Minister has not and is not going to deliver, is that the case?  What are the financial implications of that and what would be the legal route for redress in this regard?  I do not mean redress for the particular individual but in terms of trying to resolve the matter of Departments operating outside the law.

As the Ombudsman rightly stated the issue is not only this case, which she rightly highlighted, with regard to the future viability of that scheme but the application of the Equal Status Acts.  Are Departments bound by law in the same way as are the citizens of this State?  That is what is of paramount importance here.  Every business person and citizen must obey the laws and rules of this land to the best of their ability at all times.  It is not optional or correct for successive Ministers to ignore advice.  I do not blame anybody in any Department at any time or any individual for making an error if one is made.  I am of the firm belief that the person who never made a mistake never made anything.  That was the way we were brought up, namely, that people in trying to do things and trying to help people will mistakes in life.  We all do, but it is another matter when advice on issues of paramount importance is not taken by a Department, Minister, Government and indeed successive Governments.  I was a member of the former Southern Health Board when the initial controversies arose and Departments were giving advice on the nursing home changes.  I stood up at health board meetings and said that was wrong and I and others were ignored.  I was just an ordinary member of a local authority.  Taking no notice of the fact that what I said at the time was ignored, the advice of the Ombudsman at that time was ignored and eventually the outcome was that people rightfully received compensation.  Nobody wants to see the State being faced with a massive legal or compensation bill but if that is to be the case so be it.  It is not the fault of the individuals concerned or the fault of the people of this State that Departments believe they can operate outside the law and can dip in and out in terms of the application of the Equal Status Act to one or other sector of society.  In other words, its approach is: do as we say but not as we do.<\/p><p>  I genuinely thank the Ombudsman for the great service she and her office are giving, and that her predecessors have given, to the people of the country in their work.  Hopefully, Departments, Ministers and the Government will have to listen.

She has been very forthright and clear in what she said in her capacity as Ombudsman.  Hers has probably been the most strongly worded presentation I have heard from an ombudsman since becoming a Member.  I take this at the level intended.<\/p><p>  I agree that redress for the individuals involved is very important, but the Ombudsman is pointing to a much broader issue that concerns challenging the democratic mandate bestowed on all of us, not just on the Office of the Ombudsman.  It is not just a case of a Department giving two fingers to the Ombudsman stating it will not do what it says, as it is also a case of it doing the same to all elected representatives in this Parliament.  We are charged with enacting legislation which becomes the law of the land.  Departments are flagrantly flouting that law; that is the basic issue.  This is not the first instance as we have had hearings with An Coimisin&eacute;ar Teanga in respect of whom I believe there are parallel circumstances.  He made recommendations in a report but the Department of Social Protection, under guidance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has flouted the laws in this regard also.  Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, the Official Languages Act, is the law of the land but Departments are choosing not to follow it.  The issue for us as a committee is that we must say &quot;Enough is enough&quot; and that this should not be allowed to happen.<\/p><p>  Where languages and the rights and obligations of State bodies are concerned, Mr. Justice Hardiman has given an opinion based on a ruling in the Supreme Court case of &Oacute; Beol&aacute;in <i>v.<\/i> Fahy:<blockquote>The modern State necessarily imposes many onerous duties on citizens in relation to various aspects of life from tax compliance to planning law.  Many of these duties are irksome, time consuming and expensive to comply with, but compliance is properly required.<br \/><br \/>  Equally the State itself must comply with its obligations, particularly those enshrined in the Constitution and can no more be heard to complain that such compliance is irksome or onerous than can the individual citizen.  In particular, the State cannot be heard to complain that its non-compliance over a period of decades have now rendered present compliance even more difficult.<\/blockquote>Such an eminent legal opinion needs to be taken on board in this context.  I have a number of questions, however.  The Ombudsman may say they are outside her remit and more for my fellow committee members.  Could the opinion of the Department be seen as a challenge to the Houses of the Oireachtas to enact legislation?  To put it colloquially, I suggest a Department is giving the two fingers to us, implying it is outside the law and will not follow through with it.<\/p><p>  If we prove the State has a responsibility to act, does this create a <i>de facto<\/i> right to the relevant service, as was seen in the two cases?  If so, does this give the citizen a legitimate expectation that such a right would be upheld?  Do the types of reports the Ombudsman and An Coimisin&eacute;ar Teanga present prove there is a responsibility?  If so, does it confer a right on the citizen?  If so, does the citizen have legitimate expectation to prosecute that right?<\/p><p>  I noted a number of comments implying intentional delay on the part of the Department and that this is a risk-management strategy.  The Department may be trying to ensure that the cost imposed on the State is minimised but the point the Ombudsman is raising is that the potential State liability accruing from not addressing this scenario could be much larger.  I challenged the Department of Social Protection on this issue when its representatives were present to discuss the ruling of An Coimisin&eacute;ar Teanga.  It was hoped that the matter would be kicked to touch and kept out of the courts in any way possible.  It was hoped that some of the petitioners could be sorted out by striking a deal on the steps of the courthouse, thus preventing other potential cases.  If a number of landmark cases were taken and others followed suit, the potential liability of the Departments could be much greater than at present.  The cost of redress could be higher.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Ombudsman's report.  It is extremely alarming.  This committee should invite the Minister for Health before it to challenge him on the stance he has taken.  We should be making the strongest possible statement today that we agree with the Ombudsman's findings, that her ruling should be upheld and that the Department should act immediately to secure redress.  I very much thank the Ombudsman for her report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012120600008#J00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1354797900,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I thank the Ombudsman for the clarity and toughness of her report.  It is interesting to note that when the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, made his budget statement yesterday, he first opted to speak about the importance of political reform.  He reminded everybody that his Department is not just the Department responsible for public expenditure but also the one responsible for reform.  Part of the reform agenda was to set up this committee.  Therefore, on first examination, this is an opportunity for us not only to commend what the Ombudsman has said but also to do something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012120600008#J00600","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354798500,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I would welcome the interventions suggested.  The reason I outlined the other issues pertaining to nursing homes and the huge bill eventually imposed on all of us as a result of - to put it colloquially - the ducking and diving by the Department for many decades is I wanted to draw attention not only to individual issues but also to the fact that there appeared to be a particular culture in the Department.  I have often asked my colleagues in the office what it is about the Department which enables this pattern of behaviour to continue.  The Minister is intent on pursuing reform strategies and we are delighted that the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 has passed and that work is continuing on the freedom of information legislation.  However, the phrase &quot;culture eats strategy for breakfast&quot; comes to mind because the issue has transcended political parties and Governments and the same thing keeps happening.  The Department has been alerted to an illegality and chosen to ignore it, hoping and crossing its fingers that nobody will find out or that it will not be rumbled.  I tell my children that they should behave because eventually things will catch up with them and that is what has happened.  It happened most spectacularly in 2004 and the administrative schemes we are discussing offer a similar demonstration of a particular culture, albeit on a smaller scale.  I will not tell the committee how it should do its work, but to my mind an exploration of that culture has to be at the core because otherwise it will continue.<\/p><p>  On the importance of obeying the rule of law, the country is <i>in extremis<\/i> in western terms, but it is still reasonably wealthy, even if we are struggling with our budgets.  Perhaps the Department thinks what it is doing will be publicly palatable, but I do not accept this.  Recently I gave a talk on the institutions of national ombudsmen throughout Europe in which I compared western models to the new models developed following the collapse of communism in eastern, southern and central Europe.  I was struck by how quickly people wanted to cling onto offices or create new bodies such as ombudsman offices in order to embed the rule of law.  I was also struck by how fragile they could be.  I am not comparing what has happened here with what has happened in certain states where democracy is relatively undeveloped, but the same issue arises.  We either obey the rule of law or we do not.  We cannot cherry-pick the pieces that do not fit.  The Department of Health has a section that is dedicated to dealing with disability issues, with a Minister of State assigned to it.  It is not as if disability and these schemes are being dealt with by a clerical officer or a handful of people.  It cannot be beyond the capacity of that dedicated section to devise a scheme which would be fair and do what it was supposed to do in terms of allowing mobility to those whose mobility is restricted by disability while also meeting the financial criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012120600009#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1354798500,"counter":718,"content":"<p>What was the Department's response to the Ombudsman's queries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012120600009#K00300","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354798500,"counter":719,"content":"<p>There was no response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012120600009#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1354798500,"counter":720,"content":"<p>The proposal was put to the Department and there was literally no response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012120600009#K00500","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354798500,"counter":721,"content":"<p>There was no response at all to the report.

Public bodies make recommendations and when they are not implemented I come to the Oireachtas.  Assuming the committee accepts my analysis and recommendations, I assume it would complete the accountability circle by doing whatever needs to be done - for example, calling people before it and seeking reports.<\/p><p>  On the issue of illegal nursing home charges and the fact that settlements are now being offered, we have tried on many occasions, going back many years, to see the legal advice under which the Department of Health is operating, but the Department has always refused to give it to us.

Ultimately the courts will decide.  It has not got to that stage because settlements are being entered into.  Again, we tried to get information on the settlements and the basis on which they were made.  We got very little information on that either.
