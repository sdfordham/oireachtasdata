Agreed.<\/p><p> The next item is correspondence 48B, correspondence from Professor Brian Norton, president of Dublin Institute of Technology, providing information on non-competitive procurement.

A report on the latter is also included.  Is it agreed to note this?  Agreed.  If people want to raise it again in future, they may do so.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence 76B, correspondence from Mr. Robert Watt providing a follow-up on the wards of courts fund.  There is a review of the fund&rsquo;s performance between 2007 and 2009 and the committee will receive a copy.  I hope that will be during October.  Is it agreed to note the item?  Agreed.  We look forward to receiving that report.  Related correspondence is 14B.  Is it agreed that the clerk will sent a copy of the correspondence to interested individuals who have written to the committee on the topic since the committee has been in place?  Agreed.  I look forward to receiving the report in October, when we will discuss it again.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence 77B, a letter from Inland Fisheries Ireland providing an information note setting out the reasons for the non-collection of rateable debts.  It appears that a significant part of the reason for non-collection of debts is because the valuation of fisheries is outdated and was last carried out at the turn of the 1900s.  I propose that we write to the Valuation Office to be kept abreast of any future revaluation of fisheries assets.  Likewise, I propose we write to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment seeking to be kept abreast of any proposed changes in legislation on this issue.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  If people wish to raise the matter again, they are free to do so.<\/p> <p>  We have an e-mail from Deputy Josepha Madigan regarding the Olympic Council of Ireland.

We will note it and move on.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence 72C is a letter from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills on the lateness in the laying of audited accounts of An Ch&eacute;im, a body providing shared services to institutes of technology, which is being wound down.  That is why we are late receiving the accounts.  We have taken the step to write to the parent Departments of all bodies that have not had accounts laid before the Houses within the required timescale.  Is it agreed to note that?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is a letter from Mr. Gerard O'Leary, director of the office of environmental enforcement at the Environmental Protection Agency.  Mr O'Leary provides an update on a matter raised by an individual relating to dumping on his land in County Meath.  I propose we forward a copy of this correspondence to the individual in question.  Is this agreed?  Agreed.  Correspondence 78C is a letter from an individual on the difficulties with Roscommon County Council regarding two adjacent grave spaces and planning permission.  As this has to do with a local authority, it does not fall within the remit of the committee.  I propose that we write to the individual suggesting that she contact the county manager or chief executive officer directly or appeal to the Ombudsman if she is not happy with the decision of the council.  The person may also check whether it is a planning issue with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As the communication seems to point to customer service concerns, I propose we direct her in that matter.  Is this agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item on the agenda relates to statements and accounts received since our last meeting.  They are on the schedule and we can just note each of them.  They are the Health Information and Quality Authority 2015 clear audit report, the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund clear audit report, the Labour Relations Commission clear audit report up to 30 September 2015, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority clear audit report, the Equality Authority clear audit report, the Human Rights Commission clear audit report and the Church of Ireland College of Education teacher training college report.  Attention is drawn in that report to the deferred pension funding, which is normal for third level colleges.  It is a standard reference in the audit report for that issue.<\/p> <p>  The next report relates to An Ch&eacute;im Computer Services Limited, with the accounts covering 2011 to 2014, inclusive, and to August 2015.  That organisation is now being wound down, leading to a delay.  They were clear audit reports but some of them were very late coming.  There is also the audit report for St. James's Hospital board.  There is a note from the Comptroller and Auditor General indicating that all the testing of purchases in 2015 found that 1.6% of the expenditure examined related to goods and services where previous contracts had expired and had not subsequently been put to tender.  Overall expenditure in such goods and services in 2015 amounted to &euro;903,000.  Here we go again.  It is a common theme and it is something we will return to on another day.  The last set of accounts laid since the last meeting relates to the local loans fund relating to the making of loans to local authorities.  Again, it is a clear audit report.  We note all those and if a member has a query about them, he or she is free to look up the accounts and raise any matter at a subsequent meeting.<\/p> <p>  A copy of our work programme has been circulated to members.  This includes a series of planned extra dates in order to allow us to examine the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on Project Eagle more fully.  Some of these are not yet confirmed.  Most of these extra days will be on a Tuesday morning and where possible will begin a little later in order to facilitate members travelling to Dublin.  These may be scheduled for 9.30 a.m. or 10 a.m.  Does anybody wish to comment on the work programme?  It is a draft and we can discuss it at the end of the meeting to see where we are going with possible dates.  We have meetings scheduled in any event with representatives of the Department of Social Protection.  We will have our normal Thursday meetings as well.  The Minister for Finance will be before us next Thursday and after that we will have the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.<\/p> <p>  I might ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on his annual report with respect to the 2015 audits, as it would normally be issued at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#B00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Yes, it is due for publication tomorrow with the appropriation accounts for all Votes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The annual document from the Comptroller and Auditor General, which I am sure will highlight some interesting facts across all Departments, will come tomorrow.

The audit noted that NAMA had incurred a large loss on the sale and that the sale process had been compressed.  In addition, we had a concern about the circumstances of PIMCO's withdrawal from the sale competition.  I decided, therefore, that, following completion of the 2014 audit, the sale should be examined in more depth in the context of a report I was then planning on NAMA's progress over the period 2013 to 2015 - referred to as a section 226 report - as required under the NAMA Act.  At a meeting of the PAC with NAMA in mid-July 2015, I informed members of my intention to examine the Project Eagle sale.  On foot of the likely time required to produce the section 226 report, I decided to carry out a parallel examination of the value for money achieved on Project Eagle.  This allowed me to report separately on the sale.  The key issues examined in the report reflect the concerns raised at the July 2015 PAC meeting.  I should point out that my focus is entirely on assessing and reporting on the performance by NAMA of its functions.  Any references to any third party, whether named or not, are incidental to that purpose. <\/p> <p>  NAMA recorded a loss of &pound;162 million in 2014 as a result of sales relating to its Northern Ireland debtors.  Most of this related to Project Eagle.  Losses of &pound;478 million on the Northern Ireland loans had already been recognised in earlier years, reflecting deterioration in market conditions since November 2009.  That was the market value reference point used by NAMA when it bought all its loans.<\/p> <p>  The process of selling some of the Northern Ireland debtor assets was already in progress when the PIMCO approach was made to NAMA.  Those sales continued, and NAMA had sold about one eighth of the assets by the time the Project Eagle portfolio sale was completed.  NAMA incurred a loss of 1% on average on those asset sales compared to a loss of 13% on the Project Eagle loan sale.  The key choice for NAMA, following the PIMCO-Brown Rudnick approaches in 2013, was whether to continue with its planned workout of the Northern Ireland debtor loans through disposal of the assets over time or to put the loans on the market in a single portfolio sale.  Prior to other loan portfolio sales, NAMA obtained current market valuations of the property assets from its loan sale advisers.  This did not happen with Project Eagle.  In assessing the proposal from PIMCO, NAMA relied on its existing cashflow projections for the assets.  These indicated the net cash amounts NAMA projected it would receive from working out the loans, through sales of the assets, as currently planned.  Using NAMA's standard methodology and assumptions, the net present value, or NPV, of the Project Eagle cashflows as at the end of 2013 was an estimated &pound;1.49 billion. <\/p> <p>  The board decided that it would be willing to sell the loans at a minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion, as recommended to it by the NAMA executive.  The difference between that minimum price and the projected net present value was around &pound;190 million in net present value terms.  As a result, the decision to sell the loans in a portfolio, as opposed to continuing with the loan workout as planned, involved a significant probable loss of value.  In the paper to the board in December 2013, NAMA pointed out that, in formulating a bid, the purchaser of a portfolio of non-performing loans would expect to discount the current market value of the underlying property collateral assets by at least 10%.  NAMA did not have a current valuation of the property assets to which to apply this discount.  In the end, there are many strategic and commercial reasons why NAMA might prefer an early loan sale over a medium to long-term loan workout.  That is a business decision for NAMA, and is something I express no opinion on.  In fact, it falls into the realm of a policy area and I am prohibited from commenting on policy.<\/p> <p>  The possibility of a sale of the Northern Ireland loans came about as a result of a reverse inquiry, with PIMCO presenting an offer on the basis that there would be a closed sale process.  NAMA's response was that any loan sale would have to be conducted using an open sales process in line with its policy.  NAMA's policy is consistent with the standard market approach to loan portfolio sales.  If implemented, this should provide reasonable assurance that the best price currently achievable in the market is obtained.  As figure 4.1 of the report illustrates, NAMA fully implemented its own policy for Projects Tower and Arrow but not for Project Eagle.<\/p> <p>  The report sets out in detail the evolution of the sales process, as circumstances changed.  Key features are: the limited role of the loan sale advisers, Lazard; the staggered process of admission of potential purchasers to the competition; the limited information about the loans and assets; the short time allowed to the firms; and prohibition on the firms using property valuers in Northern Ireland or having contact with the debtors.  A number of the firms indicated that they had issues with the sale process rather than with the quality of the assets themselves.  At the end of the bid process, Lazard reported to NAMA that the Cerberus bid was the better of the two received.  It later provided an assurance letter to NAMA, which stated that \"having regard to the information available to us and NAMA's objectives, the sell-side process for the transaction was appropriate for the sale of a loan portfolio of this nature\".  Taking this restricted statement together with the limitations imposed on the sale process and the absence of up to date property valuations, I feel I do not have sufficient assurance that a different marketing strategy, or different timing of the sale, could not have resulted in NAMA achieving a higher price from the sale of the loans.<\/p> <p>  In terms of conflict of interest issues, I want to emphasise that the report focuses exclusively on the actions of NAMA and not on the actions of individuals or third parties.  Over time, Mr. Cushnahan declared to NAMA his involvement as an adviser to six NAMA debtors, mainly on a non-fee basis.  We found that the loans of those debtors represented approximately half the value of the Northern Ireland loan book.  A concern, therefore, arises as to whether NAMA should have considered if it was appropriate that he would engage in discussion of its Northern Ireland strategy in general and of the PIMCO proposal.<\/p> <p>  In March 2014, NAMA learned from PIMCO of the existence of an alleged success fee arrangement involving Brown Rudnick, the managing partner of Tughans and Mr. Cushnahan.  NAMA subsequently learned of the existence of a success fee arrangement involving Cerberus, on one hand, and Brown Rudnick and Tughans, on the other.  NAMA sought and relied on an assurance from Cerberus that no fee or payment was payable to anyone connected with NAMA.  Having examined the matter in detail, my view is that the allegations of Mr. Cushnahan's involvement in a fee-sharing arrangement warranted more action by NAMA when the issue came to light.<\/p> <p>  If I may, Chairman, before I finish I would like to explain a little about how the work on this examination was undertaken given some public comment in that regard.  The team I appointed to carry out the examination are all qualified accountants with significant audit and evaluation experience, including the audit of NAMA.  The examination was led by Mr. Riordan who is here with me today.  He has worked on all my office's examinations of NAMA since its inception.  When the 2014 NAMA audit concluded, we transferred the audit manager and another staff member to the examination team.  They became available to start work on the examination in June 2015.  I am satisfied that the team tasked to carry out the Project Eagle examination had the requisite skills, knowledge, experience and expertise to do the required work.<\/p><p>Contrary to what has been stated elsewhere, my office did not seek external expert assistance to carry out the Project Eagle examination.  We did, however, seek to secure a contractor to provide supplementary resources, with requisite skills and experience, to carry out reviews for us as part of the planned section 226 examination.  Specifically, I wanted to examine the level of returns NAMA has achieved through the disposal of loans and what it expected to achieve through investment in assets it continued to hold, based on a sample of approximately 50 cases.  Given the likely volume of work involved, we published an open request for tenders on 29 June 2015.  Despite a reasonable level of inquiries, we got just one tender proposal, from a firm based in London.  The proposal disclosed that one of the firm&rsquo;s principal team members had a conflict of interest.  As a result, I did not consider it appropriate to appoint the firm to carry out the work.<\/p><p> When we complete our analysis and field work, our standard approach is to present the findings to the public bodies concerned and ask them for a formal written response.  Where evidence presented to us shows a change is required, we gladly make that change.  If comments or points of view presented by an audited body are relevant but not supported by evidence, we represent those comments as the audited body&rsquo;s views in the report, so readers of the reports have both sides of the argument to hand.  I am satisfied that I have done that with this report.<\/p><p> In addition to the input we receive through audited bodies&rsquo; comments on reports, we undertake quality assurance processes for examinations, as required.  For this report, we applied more than the usual testing and challenge because of NAMA&rsquo;s strong objections to the findings.  We arranged, on a collegial basis, with our sister organisation, the UK National Audit Office, NAO, that two senior managers from its financial markets unit would review and challenge the draft report.  Both had market experience before their employment with the NAO.  As it happened, they were also just at that time finalising a report on the UK Government&rsquo;s sale of former Northern Rock financial assets.  In April 2016, they challenged my team on the findings and provisional conclusions of the draft report and provided useful information and suggestions which we took on board.  In May 2016, I asked for a further and deeper challenge process, which was undertaken by a former secretary and director of audit of my office.  He was involved in setting up and overseeing the audit of NAMA until 2012 and has also served as a member of the audit board of the European Investment Bank.  We asked him to examine all the evidence we were using regarding Project Eagle and the written responses from NAMA and to consider if the conclusions were appropriate, given the evidence.  His advice and suggestions were also taken on board in further refining the report.  These processes were a process of assurance for me.  Ultimately, as the Comptroller and Auditor General, I must draw the conclusions and make the report.<\/p><p> I hope this gives the committee an insight into the manner in which the report was prepared.  I thank it for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I appreciate that opening statement.

The opening statement from Mr. Brendan McDonagh today puts it in a nutshell.  It states that the witness had a misplaced attachment to an accounting value rather than to the real accounts in the market.   I will return to that.  There is no doubt about what NAMA thinks of the witness's assessment.  Mr. McDonagh believes that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report involves the mechanistic and rigid application of a spuriously precise and abnormally low discount rate to cashflows which are assumed, unrealistically, to be fixed and certain.  There are many other comments of that nature, which I will return to and to which I am sure the other members will refer.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the process, many of the statements made by NAMA in public and many of its statements to the committee, culminating with its statement today, basically say that the witness did not have a clue, did not seek external advice, had no experience - I do not mean this personally but am simply putting its argument - that he failed to seek extra staff from outside and so forth.

Those were included originally in the cashflow projections that it established from the beginning and which, in fact, it used to figure out the price it paid for the loans when it bought them.  Subsequently, NAMA's asset managers would have looked at those values.  In some cases they might have received new valuations, for example, in 2012 or 2013, so those would have been fed into the cashflows, but in other situations they would have reduced the cashflows to reflect trends in the market.  It is market information as opposed to specific valuations for individual properties.  That was all fed into the cashflow and those types of adjustments to the cashflows are examined every year by our office in the course of the audit.  We were always tracking the work it was doing.  In fact, we involved the Valuation Office again at the end of the audit of 2013 to look again at how NAMA was managing that process of adjusting values for properties in the cashflow.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy, quoting Mr. McDonagh, mentioned treating it as certain future amounts.  No amount in the future is certain.  Events can change and any projection is always subject to an element of uncertainty.

The quality of the assets was referred to as \"poor\" during the process of taking on the loans.  I remind the Deputy that the extensive exercise through which NAMA went in the beginning resulted in much heavier discounting of the value of the loans.  This reflected where they were and corrected the mistakes that had been made by banks in accepting much higher valuations than were appropriate.  Having taken the price out at the beginning, and then having provided for impairments because the markets were falling thereafter, there was a danger of double-counting if a very high risk rate was built into the discount rate.

In 2013, this loan portfolio had a rent roll of approximately &pound;100 million and had many assets.  An attempt has been made to characterise these assets in the north of England or Scotland as being of a poor quality, but their quality is not that poor.  They actually have value.  The day the sale of the loans goes through, access to the value of those assets is gone as well.  One loses some value as soon as that decision is made.  Nobody is disputing that if one chooses to have a loan portfolio sale, rather than working that portfolio out, the market will expect to discount those loans and will not pay one the equivalent asset value for them, and there is a loss as a result.  I am certainly not disputing that.  Everybody in the market will agree with the advice NAMA got from external advisers, even subsequently, which was that it could expect to take a loss.  That is what the figure of &pound;190 million relates to.  It is based on projections and expressed in net present value terms.

Nobody has a crystal ball telling him or her what exactly will happen and, therefore, what the result will be.  It is a tool for decision making.  What one expect is that the best effort willl be made to say, \"We have one strategy here, which is available to us, which is effectively what NAMA was set up for.  It was set up to make sure we do not have to take prices from the market at any point in time.  We have relatively inexpensive capital that will allow us to hold them and work them out.\"  That was the strategy.<\/p> <p>  On the question about cashflows and whether there was an undervaluation, there may be a difficulty with an impairment exercise that is not founded on regular valuation of the property and it may not be right.  We put a considerable effort into testing it to see that if changes were made, they were appropriate and only changes that were appropriate and supported by evidence to reflect what had actually happened.  It is NAMA's policy - it stated this and we referred to it in the report - to take a conservative view about the future.  If the market starts to feel there is an upside coming, NAMA does not necessarily respond and reflect this in the cashflows.<\/p><p>There were a couple of issues we picked up.  In the offer in December, I believe it was the letter of the 4 December from PIMCO, there is a reference to an expectation that the market has bottomed out here and that they wanted to be in for whatever growth opportunity was coming.  So, there is that risk with cashflows.  The thing that anchors the value before one goes to a loan sale is the valuation of the underlying property.  If one compares Project Eagle to Project Arrow - and in fact it is in NAMA's policy for loan sales that one gets a current market valuation - they got valuations for Project Arrow and the values that property valuers told them at that time, for those assets, were actually higher than were in the cashflows.  Applying the potential purchaser's discount they still ended up with a higher value than they were projecting with their own cashflows.  The anchor that is needed is the valuation of the underlying property collateral.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#H02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I now call Deputy Cullinane.

I first of all want to focus on the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the 58 findings.  I want to try to establish on what basis those findings were made and whether they were findings based on facts, documentary evidence and experience within NAMA; apologies, experience within the Comptroller and Auditor General's office which NAMA disputes.  It is fair that we have to interrogate the findings of Mr. McCarthy's report, which I am sure he would agree with.<\/p><p>We have some very strong comments from NAMA with regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General's organisation, which Mr. McCarthy has somewhat clarified in his introductory remarks, but I believe they need to be teased out further.  In his response to the report Mr. McDonagh has said:<\/p><blockquote>Because of the C&amp;amp;AG report&rsquo;s misplaced attachment to an accounting value rather than the real world market value which is ultimately what matters [that that was a mistake] ... ultimately, the fact that no external advisors were commissioned by C&amp;amp;AG to advise the examination meant that the report&rsquo;s conclusions are based entirely on opinions ... [not on fact, or on documentation or on paper trails but opinions, and I am assuming he is talking about the 58 findings] ... formed by staff who, to our knowledge, have no market experience and no expertise in loan sales.<\/blockquote> <p>Similar arguments are also made by Mr. Daly where he talks about Mr. McCarthy and his team carrying out a desktop review and he then questions the Comptroller and Auditor General's experience in relation to what happens in the real world.  In Mr. McCarthy's opening remarks he talked about the experience of his staff.  Could he explain to the committee in more detail the relationship between the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and NAMA since its inception.  Even prior to this report he would have had ongoing interaction with NAMA anyway.  My first question is what was the level of ongoing interaction his office had and who in the office was part of that interaction? We know there were audits every three years.  I will now turn to my second question.  Mr. McCarthy talked about his staff having accounting and auditing experience.  However, the charge being made is that they do not have experience with regard to the market and the sell side.  That is the claim being made, and because of that, Mr. McCarthy relied too heavily on his own staff who have a limited view of the world which is about accounting and auditing but not about how the market operates and how portfolios are sold etc., as NAMA would see it, and he did not then seek external advice to back up some of his conclusions.  Is there something in that, from NAMA's perspective?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#J00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I think the Deputy may not have been in the room when I explained to the committee the experience of the members of the team.  We carry out the audit of the financial statements every year and then we had three special reports, on each of which Mr. Riordan was the leader of the project.  I want to make the point that auditors audit the information that is available in the organisation.  In a situation where NAMA did not get property valuations of the assets in relation to the sale of Project Eagle - and this is the fact - then there are not valuations for us to audit.  I cannot, and it would be unreasonable and impossible for us to decide a year or 18 months later to, go back and commission valuers to value all the property to rectify what was not done by the organisation itself.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the focus of Chapter 3 of the report, it is not necessarily or exclusively an accounting issue, it is an economic analysis and evaluation issue.  I am satisfied we have the expertise and experience from our work over many years in other areas including public private partnerships, investment in capital projects etc., that we have used the same techniques that NAMA uses for its cashflow projections.  It is a relatively standard methodology.  With regard to the sales process we were doing a compliance test.  NAMA itself has set out a structure for how these sales processes are to be operated.  We were looking at how many of the elements were present and how many were missing.  One does not have to have considerable market expertise to know that a valuation was not received or that advice around the strategy that should be adopted was received.  I am not trying to make judgments about the strategy that NAMA adopted with regard to the way it shaped the portfolio and so on.  That is not a judgment call that I am making here.  If there was something contentious, if there was advice even to be analysed, then it would have been appropriate perhaps to hire other experts to give another point of view.  But that was not there.  It is standard procedure for a loan sale adviser to give advice on the structure of the portfolio and what way to present the assets to the market.  When one compares Project Eagle, there was no such advice from the loan sale adviser so there is not anything for me to audit there either.  With regard to auditing the process and if things that happened in a sale competition either did or did not happen, it is not that technical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Okay.

There has been a lot of media and public focus on the scale of the probable, or possible, loss but for our purposes, the main concern should be the handling of the transaction by NAMA and the role of the board in that regard.  Can Mr. McCarthy comment on the oversight role of the board?  The board was of the view that a 5.5% discount rate was appropriate and that it had considered a lower discount rate.  I am curious to know about the level of scrutiny and discussion that took place at board level, given its decision on the appropriate discount rate.  When details of Project Eagle were provided to the board, to what extent did it scrutinise the terms of the sale?  One would expect that a very significant discrepancy between the cashflow figure and the price achieved, based on a much more significant discount, would have been a matter of concern to the board.

It is remarkable that the Comptroller and Auditor General does not form any view on the value for money but comments that the decision to sell the loans at a minimum of &pound;1.3 billion involved \"a significant probable loss of value\" to the State.<\/p><p>In the time available to me, I will focus my remarks on this comment which NAMA very emphatically rejects.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s view is that a discount rate of 5.5% would have been appropriate to derive the market value of this portfolio.  Not only does the report fail to provide any market or expert support for this view, but it inexplicably ignores strong market evidence from international loan sales experts which would have supported the use of a discount in the 10% to 15% range.  This report has adopted a position which would not be accepted by anyone engaged in actual loan sales in Ireland or anywhere else.  The Comptroller and Auditor General position holds that there should have been no divergence between the end-2013 proxy accounting value of the portfolio of &pound;1.465 billion, based on a 5.5% discount rate, and a market value of approximately &pound;1.3 billion, based on a 10% discount rate, and that, therefore, NAMA should not have accepted anything less than its accounting value.<\/p><p> The accounting value of the portfolio was derived using effective interest rate, EIR, discount rates, which are based on the IFRS accounting rules that NAMA has been required to follow since inception.  They were not market rates and no potential purchaser would have applied them to value the portfolio.  Valuation of the portfolio at EIR rates may be appropriate for ongoing NAMA accounting purposes but clearly not appropriate when determining a market sales value.  NAMA's view, which is supported by expert market evidence from four internationally recognised loan sales experts and which we provided to the committee last week, is that a discount rate in the 10% to 15% range was appropriate to apply to the cash flows associated with the Project Eagle portfolio.  This reflects the cost of capital that bidders would have incurred in early 2014.  It is also very much in line with the range of discount rates - 10% to 15% - which were applied in a number of our other loan sales that NAMA conducted.  It also reflects the inherent risk associated with a loan portfolio which was secured, for the most part, by a granular portfolio of non-prime assets, located mainly in Northern Ireland and in northern parts of Britain.  The positions on this issue are very stark: NAMA and the loan sales market have one view on the appropriate discount rate; the Comptroller and Auditor General report appears to be alone in its view.  It would not have been difficult for the report&rsquo;s authors to have consulted market experts on this crucial point, something the NAMA board requested them to do.  For some reason, however, this was not done.<\/p><p> A second major difficulty with the report&rsquo;s understanding of the valuation issue is that it assumes that cash flow projections are fixed and certain.  In reality, cash flow projections are no more than estimates of the income and disposal proceeds that assets may generate in the future.  They are a point-in-time exercise.  NAMA carries out a formal impairment review each 30 June and 31 December.  There can be no certainty attached to the timing of cash flows or that they will remain constant.  This uncertainty is compounded in the case of granular, secondary portfolio assets.  For instance, cash flow projections associated with Dundrum Town Centre have a reasonable level of certainty attached to them because of the attractiveness of the asset to shoppers, to tenants and to potential purchasers.  This is a strong income-producing asset with strong tenants.  On the other hand, the cash flows attaching to small assets in Northern Ireland and certain parts of northern England and Scotland are much less certain both in terms of projected disposal proceeds and projected income.  Some assets had no income stream.  A total of 31% of the Northern Ireland portfolio comprised land and development assets.  The top 55 assets in Project Eagle accounted for almost two thirds of the portfolio&rsquo;s value.  That left the rest of the portfolio with about 870 assets which had an average value of &pound;600,000 each.  It made sense, through a loan sale, to bundle poorer quality assets with the better quality and higher value assets.  In general, the less attractive the assets and the income stream securing a loan portfolio and the less certain that the associated cash flows will actually be received, the higher the risk premium and, therefore, the discount rate that will be applied by buyers.<\/p><p> The report&rsquo;s valuation approach involved in our view a mechanistic and rigid application of a spuriously precise and abnormally low discount rate to cash flows which are assumed, unrealistically, to be fixed and certain.  In both respects, the level of certainty attached to cash flows and the discount rate, are seriously at odds with how distressed debt portfolios such as Project Eagle are actually valued by investors and purchasers in reality.  The minimum sales price set by the NAMA board was &pound;1.3 billion.  That falls within the mid-point range of sale values generated by the 10% to 15% range of market discount rates that would have applied to a portfolio such as Project Eagle during the first half of 2014.  A 10% buyer discount rate produces a value of &pound;1.35 billion; a 15% discount rate produces a value of &pound;1.25 billion.  The &pound;1.322 billion achieved on the sale, which was above the minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion, was, therefore, well within the expected range of expected market values.<\/p><p> The only evidence offered in the report to support the use of a 5.5% discount rate is a NAMA board decision of June 2013.  However, for some reason, the report ignores important caveats which were applied by the board in the case of its approved discount rate methodology and which were clearly set out in the paper on which that decision was based.  The board decision of June 2013 noted that a 5.5% rate should not be used as an overarching discount rate to evaluate all potential transactions and that flexibility should be maintained.  In particular, the board approved the position that \"care should be taken to ensure that both (a) alternative NPV scenarios are generated using alternative discount rates and (b) that qualitative information would be considered as part of the decision-making process\".<\/p><p> A discount rate of 5.5% may have been appropriate for overall portfolio accounting purposes and, indeed, for some individual transaction evaluations but would not have been appropriate for all segments or assets within the portfolio.  The flexible approach approved by the board in June 2013 was clearly designed to deal with the evaluation of transactions and lower quality assets such as Project Eagle which was not typical of the NAMA portfolio as a whole.  As I indicated, discount rates in the 10% to 15% range were applied to cash flows in later loan portfolio sales.  There was very good reason the Project Eagle portfolio would have been subject to a higher discount rate, including the relatively poor quality of the underlying assets and the underlying weak economic conditions in Northern Ireland and in parts of northern England and Scotland.  The discount rate would also have reflected the inherent macro risk associated with a high concentration of assets located in the small Northern Ireland economy.  The Northern Ireland property market did not have the capacity to absorb a large volume of asset sales over a short time; this lack of market liquidity was evidenced by the fact that in the four years from 2010 to the end of 2013, sales of NAMA-secured assets in Northern Ireland realised a total of only &pound;100 million.  This consideration would not have applied to the Dublin or London markets.<\/p><p> Project Tower, a better quality portfolio than Project Eagle and to which it has been compared in the report, was launched to market at the same time in quarter 1 of 2014.  UBS, our loan sale adviser for Project Tower, advised that a 10% discount rate was appropriate.  In Project Arrow, a portfolio with similar characteristics to Eagle, Cushman and Wakefield, our adviser, advised us in mid-2015 that a 15% discount rate was appropriate.  This demonstrates that NAMA&rsquo;s position on discount rates reflects the market reality of loan sale pricing.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s claim that Project Eagle involved a significant \"probable loss\" of value to the State rests on its mistaken view that the board adopted a \"standard\" discount rate of 5.5% in June 2013 to be used subsequently for all future evaluations.  The board firmly rejects this Comptroller and Auditor General interpretation of its own decision.  It is clear from the June 2013 decision itself, as quoted earlier, that the board did not intend that 5.5% should be a one-size-fits-all discount rate.  When it became clear to the board that the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s examination team was unwilling to accept the board&rsquo;s understanding of its own decision on the &pound;1.3 billion minimum price, it offered to meet the Comptroller and Auditor General directly to discuss this issue and to discuss the key points.  The board&rsquo;s offer, however, was refused by the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office has not been consistent in the application and guidance it has provided in writing to the NAMA audit committee and board.  In his end-2013 management letter issued after an unqualified sign-off of the 2013 financial statements, the Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledged that NAMA&rsquo;s strategy was evolving from individual asset-by-asset sales to a greater focus on bulk loan portfolio sales.  In that context, both NAMA and Comptroller and Auditor General staff agreed in 2013 and 2014 that we could not have maintained the previous carrying value of the portfolio once the strategy changed from individual asset sales to a loan sale of full debtor connections.  This is evident from the end-2013 management letter, which was issued in mid-2014, in which the following is stated: \"Where a change in strategy is effected which results in either (i) a change in the sale of underlying collateral to a loan sale\/portfolio sale or (ii) a change in the sale of a loan\/loan portfolio to the sale of the underlying collateral, cash flows should be updated to reflect the most up to date position to mitigate the risk of an incorrect impairment provision being recognised.\"  Two things are clear from this.  One is that senior Comptroller and Auditor General staff in 2013 took the view that the carrying value of assets included in a loan sale could differ from their carrying value as individual items of collateral.  Second, it shows that senior Comptroller and Auditor General staff in 2013 would have expected NAMA to update the portfolio&rsquo;s carrying value in response to a change in strategy and to the emergence of up-to-date information relevant to judgments on impairment.<\/p><p> Ultimately, the value of any loan portfolio, including the Project Eagle portfolio, is what credible bidders are willing to pay for it at a point in time taking account of demand-supply and economic conditions.<\/p><p>If we had halted the Eagle loan sale, we would have had to adjust our carrying value to bring it into line with the market price indications we had received from potential bidders.  This is absolutely consistent with the IAS 39 IFRS accounting guidance and in line with NAMA's own understanding.  Indeed, it is very much in line with the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s 2013 management letter recommendation, although not apparently in line with the view adopted in this report.  What this means in layman's terms is that if the best bid for Eagle had been &pound;1.1 billion and NAMA had therefore decided not to sell, the Comptroller and Auditor General's office would have insisted - rightly, in my view - based on the end-2013 management letter that NAMA write down the portfolio to &pound;1.1 billion.  NAMA could then have sold the portfolio later in 2014, perhaps for &pound;1.1 billion, and there would have been no talk of a probable loss to the taxpayer, merely because the accounting adjustment with a higher impairment would already have been made at that stage.  Ironically, because NAMA was guided by its section 10 of the NAMA Act objective of getting the best price achievable, it set the minimum price at a more aggressive &pound;1.3 billion.  It achieved in excess of that price target.  As a result, we are now being accused of losing &pound;190 million because of the Comptroller and Auditor General report's misplaced attachment to an accounting value rather than the real world market value, which is ultimately what matters.  It would be absurd if NAMA's commercial activity was driven by accounting valuations rather than by real world values.  In effect, the practical consequence of the position now adopted by this report is that NAMA would never have sold the Eagle portfolio or any other similar loan portfolio if the market value failed to match NAMA's accounting value.  It is worth bearing in mind that an accounting value is no more than a provisional estimate of value until confirmed or otherwise amended by evidence of market value, that is when it is sold.<br\/><br\/>NAMA, under legislation enacted by the Oireachtas, has to operate by reference to commercial principles.  Acceptance of the Comptroller and Auditor General's unrealistic and uncommercial position would make commercial decision-making impossible.  That is why this issue goes to the heart of NAMA's commercial mandate and why we have no alternative but to contest the stance as evident in this report. <br\/><br\/>The issue of valuation and the appropriate discount rate is closely bound up with the procedure adopted by the Comptroller and Auditor General in preparing this report.  Prior to commencing his examination of Project Eagle, the Comptroller and Auditor General sought external specialist expert advice to assist him in his examination.  This was, in effect, an acknowledgement of the reality that he needed expert advice if he was to conduct the examination in a properly informed manner.  Ultimately, the fact that no external advisers were commissioned to advise the examination means that the report's conclusions are based entirely on opinions formed by staff who, to our knowledge, have no market experience and no expertise in loan sales.  By contrast, when the Comptroller and Auditor General's office was preparing an earlier report on NAMA's management of loans in 2012, the then Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. John Buckley, commissioned external advice on the property valuation process and on legal issues.  Mr. Buckley stated that he did so &quot;in order to gain assurance&quot; about two elements of the process on which his office had no expertise, namely the valuation of properties and legal due diligence.  Mr. Buckley relied heavily on expert evidence in arriving at his conclusions.  We are aware of at least one other instance in which Mr. Buckley sought external expert advice from property consultants.  Contrary to recent press reports, NAMA is not the first State body to contest the Comptroller and Auditor General's findings on matters which are outside its expertise.  In December 2010, during a discussion at the Committee of Public Accounts on the OPW Vote, where the OPW disagreed with the Comptroller and Auditor General's position, Mr. Buckley stated the following: <\/p><blockquote>Normally when we carry out assessments, we operate on the basis of our own work.  Here, however, we are dealing with an area of expertise that is outside of our comfort zone.  As a result, we employed consultants. <\/blockquote><p>In his evidence to the banking inquiry, the current Comptroller and Auditor General stated that external experts were engaged on four occasions between 2010 and 2014 to provide specialist assistance on issues relating to NAMA.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>Matters which are taken into account in the decision to engage an expert include the competence, capability and objectivity of the expert; the significance of the accounting area or nature of the matter to which the expert&rsquo;s work relates; and the significance of that expert&rsquo;s work in the context of the audit or reporting work. <\/blockquote><p>Therefore, it is all the more extraordinary that the external expert advice was not utilised on this review given that loan sales are new to the Irish market and are certainly more esoteric than property or other matters on which external expert advice has been utilised in the past.  <br\/><br\/>During the same discussion in December 2010, Mr. Buckley went on to point out that &quot;when one is examining the performance of the OPW, there is no point in using the way it operates as a yardstick to judge that performance&quot;.  In other words, good practice requires that you judge performance by reference to some objective external benchmark.  In that context, we note that the current Comptroller and Auditor General report on Project Eagle reviews the Eagle sales process by reference to later NAMA loan sales processes, not by reference to the numerous non-NAMA sales processes which took place in Ireland and elsewhere in 2014.  In effect, the Comptroller and Auditor General benchmarks NAMA against itself, not against the wider market.  It would have been instructive to have compared the due diligence information in the Eagle data room with the quality of information available to bidders for the IBRC loan portfolios which were sold by the liquidator at the same time in 2014.  That would have been a very relevant and useful comparison.  It would also have been instructive to compare the targeted loan sales process applied in Eagle with the more targeted sales processes adopted by RBS and Lloyds loan sales in the UK.  It could have shown that the targeting of major investors is a regular feature of the loan sales market.  Unfortunately the relevant comparisons, which would have placed the Eagle sales process in a proper market perspective, were not carried out.  Why not?  It would not have required a huge amount of effort.  Are these not obvious comparators which one would expect to find in any major review, like that of Project Eagle, which purports to be authoritative?<br\/><br\/>It is difficult to understand why the well-established Comptroller and Auditor General precedent of using external expertise was not utilised in the review of Project Eagle.  The area of loan sales is very much a specialist area and is not one on which the Comptroller and Auditor General's staff could reasonably be expected to have detailed expertise.  There would have been nothing wrong in acknowledging this.  The view of the NAMA board is that if the Comptroller and Auditor General's examination had been informed by external market expertise and expertise in loan sale valuation and sales processes, its comment on this key valuation issue would have been very different.  Given that this very unsound comment stems directly from what we regard as the inadequate examination process that was adopted, it would be entirely unsatisfactory if it was the last word on the matter.  A report which is prepared to make such a resounding and serious comment must be properly supported by convincing, formidable and sufficient evidence - evidence that is based on accepted market valuation methodology, evidence that would be accepted by market experts and evidence based on market comparators.  Unfortunately, the evidence produced in this report falls well short on all of these counts.<br\/><br\/>I will add one more point which is not in my speech but which arose this morning from the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement.  As an additional point, the Comptroller and Auditor General advised in his opening statement that his office consulted two officials in the UK National Audit Office who reviewed the Northern Rock loan sale in the UK.  I have looked at the National Audit Office report and it should be noted that in its description of the audit it undertook, it said it used semi-structured interviews with the following: Credit Suisse and Moelis, which advised both UK asset recovery and UK financial investments; the bidders in the process including Cerberus, which won that loan sale portfolio; KPMG, which helped out with the due diligence involved in putting that portfolio on the market; the financial conduct authority in the UK; UK treasury; UKFI; and UKAR.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did not do this with any of the equivalent bodies in respect of Project Eagle.  Why not, if it had consulted the National Audit Office?<br\/><br\/><b>Deputy Catherine Connolly:<\/b>Can we have a copy of Mr. McDonagh's additional comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":735,"content":"<p>Are Mr. McDonagh's additional comments typed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#HH00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":736,"content":"<p>It is handwritten but I can make a copy of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":737,"content":"<p>Will Mr. McDonagh pass his note to the committee secretariat who will arrange to make a copy for distribution?

Ultimately, the Oireachtas established NAMA as a commercial entity and running a commercial entity is ultimately about making commercial decisions.  All of them are necessary, many of them are complex and difficult, some of them are palatable and some are not.  Project Eagle required us to make a number of decisions, some of which, as I will outline later, were difficult indeed.<br\/><br\/>Our key decision was to set a minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion for the portfolio.  We are satisfied, as much now as we were in April 2014, that the &pound;1.322 billion that we got was the best price achievable.  If we were selling Project Eagle today, we would be very unlikely to match that price.  It is by no means certain indeed that there would be any bidders.<br\/><br\/>Mr. McDonagh has already explained NAMA&rsquo;s position on the key issue of price and valuation.  I would like, therefore, to focus in my statement on two other issues raised by the report.  The first relates to the sales process.  The second concerns the role of Frank Cushnahan.  The sales process adopted in the case of Project Eagle was initially influenced by the stated preference of both governments, which is on the public record, that the sale be conducted in a discreet and confidential manner.  This was done to minimise the risks to the wider Northern Ireland economy and to avoid perceptions that an Irish State agency was, as it were, auctioning or selling off Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland could not have been, and was not, just another jurisdiction from our perspective.  The heightened political sensitivity associated with it is evidenced by the fact that NAMA was a regular agenda item for North-South intergovernmental meetings.<br\/><br\/>There was a concern that a fully open sales process, which would by its nature take longer to conduct and would freeze activity in the Northern Ireland market for a period of nine to 12 months.  As is clear from the Department of Finance minutes of a conference call between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Northern Ireland First Minister, Mr. Robinson, and Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, on 14 January 2014, there was very broad political consensus on the need for sensitive management of this sale.  The minutes record that, during that call, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, &quot;agreed that confidentiality was important and that both his department and NAMA would take appropriate steps&quot;.  It is understandable that senior Northern Ireland politicians would have been concerned about the risk of an auction as they saw it and that they would have expressed those concerns.  It is also understandable that the Minister for Finance would have sought, in the spirit of positive North-South engagement, to accommodate their concerns on this point.  However, it is also clear that from the beginning the Minister for Finance understood and supported NAMA&rsquo;s policy in regard to open marketing.<br\/><br\/>NAMA was willing to consider the wishes of the two governments on the sales process because it was our view that the appropriate sales process for Project Eagle commercially was a targeted one that focused on key investors with the financial wherewithal and the appetite to purchase this portfolio.  We did not believe that a fully open sales process would yield any additional benefit in terms of identifying other credible bidders or of getting a higher price.  We were very cognisant of the potential damage that a fully open process could cause to the Northern Ireland property market and to the wider Northern Ireland economy.  We are a commercial State body but we do not operate in a bubble that ignores the bigger issues on the island of Ireland.  That might apply to entities that are not affiliated to the State but it does not apply to us.  When news of the prospective sale became public in February 2014, it was our judgement that there would be no advantage to opening up the process to all comers at that stage, as all the main investors had already been approached or were about to be invited into the process.  I believe that our judgement was right on this issue and that view is supported by a review of European loan sales activity in the period from 2013 to 2015.<br\/><br\/>The board appointed Lazard to run a targeted sales process that engaged all potential credible bidders - bidders with the financial wherewithal to submit serious bids for a portfolio of this size and granularity.  Between them, the nine bidders that Lazard invited into the process accounted for 88% of all European and 92% of all UK and Irish commercial real estate loan sales worth more than &euro;1 billion between 2013 and 2015.  The potential bidders who were refused access to the process accounted for a negligible share of the market during the same period.  This objective evidence shows that no credible potential bidders were excluded from this process.<br\/><br\/>By contrast with that objective evidence, the report puts forward the hypothesis that there might have been other credible bidders, but it gives no indication of who they might have been.  Lazard advised that:<\/p><blockquote>... the process was open to the most qualified and credible potential counterparties.  There were fewer participants in this process than in some other transactions because there were fewer investors that were sufficiently qualified and credible.<\/blockquote> <p>No credible market-based evidence has been produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General to counter the expert advice provided to NAMA by Lazard.  Hypothesis is not evidence.  Critically, Lazard also categorically stands over its key recommendation to the NAMA board in April 2014 that there was sufficient competitive tension in this sales process right until the end.  Again, no evidence is advanced to counter that of Lazard.<br\/><br\/>Some commentators have questioned how a process in which nine potential bids were reduced to two final bids could be described as a competitive one.  The report did not compare Project Eagle with non-NAMA sales and with sales in other jurisdictions, but if it had, it would have found that the vast majority of loan sales tend to result in two to three final bids.  Even within the ambit of NAMA sales, Project Arrow involved 18 initial expressions of interest which culminated in two final bids.  The Project Jewel-Dundrum Town Centre sale also involved two final bidders.<br\/><br\/>If the Comptroller and Auditor General had sought market advice on loan sales, he would have discovered that loan sales, like many other types of auction, tend to attract a fair number of what might be called &quot;tyre kickers&quot;, in other words, those who want to have a look but have no serious interest or capacity to buy.<\/p><p>The key to a competitive sales process is not the number of people who want to get into the auction room but the financial capacity of the much smaller number who are in a position to write the cheque.  Our concern in the case of Eagle was to ensure that all those who could have written the cheque were offered the opportunity to review the portfolio and to bid for it, if they were interested.<\/p><p> I now wish to address the suggestion that the NAMA board should have halted the sale when it became aware in March 2014 of PIMCO's proposed fee arrangement with Mr. Frank Cushnahan.  Let me say first this was not a straightforward or an easy decision.  On the one hand, we had discovered that an individual, who had served on NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC, who had been strongly endorsed by the Northern Ireland Government and who appeared to have been a respected figure in the Northern Ireland business community, was also involved with the PIMCO bid.  On the other hand, we had to weigh up the potentially serious costs and consequences for NAMA, for other State-owned banks and for the sovereign of halting a major loan sale, particularly at such a late stage in the process when investors were fully engaged and committed.  We had to consider whether major international investors, which had spent large sums of money on due diligence, would come back to the table if the portfolio were put back on the market again at a later stage.  Was the market likely to ignore a collapsed Project Eagle when forming its view on subsequent loan sales in Ireland, sales by NAMA and sales by other sellers?  What about the risks to the sovereign?  Would Ireland's reputation suffer if the first major loan sale by Ireland's asset management agency was pulled?  Would a halted Eagle sale create new uncertainty over the State's contingent liabilities just as Ireland was exiting the troika programme?  There was also the fact, which has been confirmed by this report - the Comptroller and Auditor General's report - that the external members of the NIAC had no access to confidential NAMA information.  The net issue for us was whether we were going to allow Mr. Cushnahan's alleged manoeuvrings in Belfast to seriously damage the interests of Irish taxpayers.  Our judgment then, and one that we stand over now, was that the interests of Irish taxpayers took precedence.  Commercially, we considered that there was a compelling case for selling this portfolio.  All of this was predicated on an outcome where we would achieve our &pound;1.3 billion minimum price. <\/p><p> The issue has been raised as to whether we should have removed Mr. Cushnahan from the Northern Ireland advisory committee, given his declared involvement with six of the 56 Northern Ireland debtors.  There has been an attempt over recent months to inflate the significance of the NIAC and its influence on NAMA strategy.  The facts are as follows.  The terms of reference of the NIAC were written so as to ensure it had no role whatsoever in relation to NAMA debtors or to the assets securing their loans.  No discussion on debtors or particular assets was ever permitted at NIAC meetings.  No information relating to debtors or assets was ever provided to external members of the NIAC - this is confirmed by the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The NIAC had no decision-making powers.  There had been a determined and concerted attempt in 2011 by the external members of the NIAC to change that.  They proposed that the terms of reference be changed to allow NIAC members to be provided with \"relevant confidential information\".  The NAMA board flatly rejected that proposal.  There were other later attempts to discuss particular debtors and assets but they were always resisted. <\/p><p> A lot more has recently come to light about Mr. Cushnahan's various alleged activities but I would ask the committee, in the interests of fairness, to consider NAMA's decision by reference to what we knew in 2012 and 2013.  Based on allegations that have emerged more recently, we have made two separate complaints to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, and we have made a report to the Garda, but we could not have done this on the basis of what we knew in March 2014.  It would appear that Mr. Cushnahan, who was peripheral in the context of NAMA's Northern Ireland strategy, may have presented himself in Belfast as a key player who was in a position to influence NAMA.  Quite frankly, this was nonsense.  He was an external member of the NIAC which was, in effect, a cross-Border diplomatic conduit set up at the behest of the two Governments in order to channel the general views of Northern Ireland strategic and economic interests to NAMA.  Clearly, we listened to the views of the two external members but they were never under any illusion as to the fact that NAMA's strategy for Northern Ireland was determined by the NAMA board.  The two external NIAC members often, in fact, complained to me as Chairman that they got no specific information and that they were kept in the dark.  That was exactly the intention of the NAMA board.  In fact, I cannot recall a single strategic or other decision by the NAMA board that was directly influenced by the views of the NIAC.<\/p><p> For that reason, and despite the NIAC's very limited role, removing Mr. Cushnahan from the committee before his resignation in November 2013 would have been seen as a very significant and controversial move and one that would have caused tensions in the positive cross-Border political engagement that has served the island of Ireland so well over recent decades.  Given that the removal of Mr. Cushnahan would have been presented as a slight to Northern Ireland interests, we could not have done so without being satisfied that such an action was justified and proportionate.  From 2010 to 2013 we had no reason to take such action and we are satisfied that we managed Mr. Cushnahan's conflicts of interests appropriately.  In any event, I say again, the NIAC did not discuss debtors or assets, so in effect the committee was of little consequence.<\/p><p> The recent BBC TV programme that featured Mr. Cushnahan included references to a document which purportedly included NAMA's confidential valuations of properties owned by a NAMA debtor.  It is clear to us that the allegedly confidential NAMA valuations were not our valuations at all.  They were, in fact, significantly lower than NAMA's actual valuations, by up to 80% in one case.  Therefore, whatever services Mr. Cushnahan may allegedly have been offering to debtors and investors in Belfast, he certainly was not in a position to offer them confidential NAMA information or any influence over NAMA.<\/p><p> For the avoidance of any doubt, we had no knowledge in March 2014 of the allegations that have subsequently emerged surrounding Mr. Cushnahan.  If we had known, in 2013, what we now know about these allegations we would have terminated Mr. Cushnahan's involvement with the NIAC, regardless of the intergovernmental difficulties that might have arisen.  Mr. Cushnahan may well have been an influential figure in Belfast, he may have sought to represent himself as a key pivot between debtors, investors and politicians but he had no influence with NAMA.  If he managed to persuade some people that he had an influence on NAMA, they were blatantly misled.  To some in Northern Ireland, and perhaps to himself, Mr. Cushnahan was a NAMA insider but as far as NAMA is concerned he was peripheral. <\/p><p> Clearly, given the National Crime Agency's investigation in Northern Ireland, I cannot comment on any alleged wrongdoing that may have taken place there.  If there has been wrongdoing, the relevant Northern Ireland authorities will no doubt take appropriate action and believe me, nobody wants to see that happen more than I do.  But whatever went on in Northern Ireland, I cannot see how it can be conflated with the outcome of the Project Eagle sales process, which saw sales proceeds of &pound;1.322 billion ultimately realised by NAMA. <\/p><p> We are aware that allegations have been made concerning NAMA's former head of asset recovery, Ronnie Hanna, by at least two sources, Deputy Wallace and Mr. Cushnahan.  So far as we can see, neither party has produced evidence to substantiate these allegations.  As there are investigations ongoing by the National Crime Agency in Northern Ireland concerning Project Eagle, investigations with which NAMA is fully assisting, we will not comment in any detail on these allegations.  What we can say is that NAMA has no evidence or knowledge that would go any way towards substantiating the allegations. <\/p><p> For the avoidance of any doubt whatsoever on the matter, let me say unequivocally that the price for Eagle was set by the NAMA board and the decision to accept the winning bid was set by the NAMA board and made by the NAMA board and not by anyone else.  Nobody else influenced the NAMA board in this &ndash; no Minister North or South and certainly not the two external members of the NIAC.  I reiterate the Board's belief that any informed analysis of Project Eagle or, indeed, any of NAMA's loan sales, will find that NAMA acted commercially and that our decisions were, at all times, guided by the best interests of Irish taxpayers.<\/p><p>In this instance, the Comptroller and Auditor General has come to a different view but, for reasons which have been outlined by Mr. McDonagh, the rationale for the Comptroller and Auditor General's position is not one that could reasonably be accepted by anyone with knowledge and expertise in loan sales. <br\/><br\/>We very much respect the competence and expertise of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office in the normal audit work that they carry out in regard to our financial statements.  I very much appreciate the way in which the Comptroller and Auditor General gave evidence to this committee this morning.  It was very fair and balanced.  He acknowledged that we have a good professional working relationship.  Our engagement with them on the Eagle examination, however, has been difficult and our decision to challenge his key conclusions has not been taken lightly, believe me.  This is a serious professional disagreement and we feel strongly that his conclusions would have been different if he had engaged specialist expertise in property and loan sales that he himself recognised as being necessary at the start of his examination. <br\/><br\/>I also believe that the Comptroller and Auditor General's review relied too heavily on the narrow range of evidence provided by board papers and minutes.  Ultimately, the papers presented to the board were no more than the starting point for the extensive and wide-ranging discussions that followed.  It should be borne in mind that the board was comprised of people who are very experienced across a range of commercial disciplines, including business, property, capital markets, accounting, insolvency, public administration and governance.  The decisions made in regard to Eagle, as with any other decision, were informed by their individual and collective experience and expertise in these different disciplines. <br\/><br\/>As regards board minutes, they are, by their nature, no more than a summary of what was ultimately agreed.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement quotes one of the leading texts on the role of company secretaries as stating that minutes &quot;are meant to record decisions, rather than discussions&quot;.<b><i><\/i><\/b>They are not intended to act as a transcript of board discussions and they can never capture all the complexity and nuances of the deliberations that ultimately lead to a board decision. <br\/><br\/>In terms of the key decision to sell the portfolio at a minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion, the board decision was unanimous but that does not mean that all members arrived at the decision for the same reasons.  That is why it would have been useful for the Comptroller and Auditor General to have discussed this directly with board members as part of his evidence gathering process.  Our offer, unfortunately, was declined.  <br\/><br\/>In that context, I very much welcome the decision of this committee to meet with the individual NAMA board members and to provide them with an opportunity to put forward their individual perspectives, an opportunity which was denied to them during the section 9 examination.  If there is a common theme between my remarks and those of the CEO it is that a desktop review of papers, with no input from commercial experts, is totally inadequate as a means of reviewing the complexities associated with a major commercial transaction such as Project Eagle. <br\/><br\/>I also welcome, Chairman, the fact that the inquiry to be established by the Oireachtas provides an opportunity to bring an informed market perspective to bear on the financial outcome of the Project Eagle transaction.  NAMA does not believe that the price achieved on the Project Eagle sale represented a &quot;probable loss&quot; to Irish taxpayers and we look forward to making our case to an inquiry which should, I hope, have the resources to evaluate the commercial issue with appropriate expertise and market knowledge.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#JJ02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":767,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Daly.

We would say, in fact, that approximately 50% of the Project Eagle assets were directly or indirectly based on valuations.  We adopted a bespoke process in this and we accepted that certain features of the normal sales process would not actually apply, including the commissioning of property valuations.  That was related to sensitivities about the Northern Ireland market and the fact that if we had started doing that it would have been very apparent very quickly that we were about to embark on a sale of the portfolio.  I believe we would have been totally frustrated by some of the debtors if they got wind of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#LL00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":769,"content":"<p>Was that information made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#LL00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":770,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#LL00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":771,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#LL00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":772,"content":"<p>Fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#LL00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":773,"content":"<p>I think the other point is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#LL00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":774,"content":"<p>We will come back to the point that valuations were available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#LL00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":775,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#LL01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":776,"content":"<p>I did not sense that in any of the documents that we have received up to now.

NAMA stepped outside its own established procedure in a two-stage sales process which was established for dealing with assets worth &euro;50 million and more.  It appointed loan sale advisers, but it seems it only gave them a verbal briefing and a very limited role.  It included not inviting them to carry out the valuation process.

One of two scenarios is possible: either the minutes are inaccurate or whoever was on the telephone was having a different conversation than the one which had been had at the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#OO00400","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":878,"content":"<p>No, I do not think there is any difference.  The minutes read: \"PIMCO, ostensibly in the spirit of transparency, wish to advise NAMA about the success fee arrangement and sought NAMA's agreement that it was appropriate\".  I am not sure what is wrong with that.  It was saying: \"We have this and think it is okay.  Can we stay in?\"  Our view was totally and utterly different.  One should remember that PIMCO's advice on the fee arrangement came not from its commercial side that was negotiating and bidding but from its compliance unit and counsel who at a very late stage in reviewing the draft letters of engagement saw the possible conflict and then insisted on us being told straightaway.  That was the sequence of events.  One would need to look also at the telephone call which I think was probably made on 12 March, in which it confirmed that it was withdrawing from the process and that our head of legal stated that what had been disclosed by PIMCO had made its withdrawal inevitable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#OO00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":879,"content":"<p>Let me read from the minutes of 12 March: \"PIMCO advised NAMA that it had no option but to withdraw from the process.

We appreciate their taking the time to do so.<\/p><p>I was struck earlier by Mr. Daly's statement that running a commercial entity involves making commercial decisions.  That is all fine and well if it is the local sale of work but in this instance we are speaking about NAMA.  I find it very difficult to listen to what Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh are saying today, with respect, <i>vis-a-vis<\/i>the report from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It strikes me that there are a lot of &quot;Nos&quot; in the report.From my reading of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, there are no records of any discussions around the sale of Project Eagle, which to my mind would be a basic administrative secretarial duty; there are no formal valuations of the property collateral and so there are no clear valuation methods.  As we know, the <i>sine qua non<\/i>of conveyancing is a proper valuation, which is clearly absent in this regard.  Formal expert advice was only received retrospectively.  There was no contact with Mr. Cushnahan re his fee arrangement and no considered approach of the sales scheme.  It appears to me that haste was put before any due diligence or prudence.  There was a lack of openness in relation to the bidding process.  I do not accept what the witnesses had to say regarding the sensitivities in Northern Ireland.  I think that is convenient.  There are no conflict of interest evaluations, no adherence to standard NAMA sales and, even worse, there is no admission of wrongdoing today.  The witnesses did state there could be some tweaking but they do not overall accept the premise of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  <\/p><p>Even taking into account a divergence in relation to valuations, for the taxpayer there is a huge dichotomy in relation to the &pound;190 million.  Whether the amount is &pound;150 million or &pound;160 million, it is still a huge amount of money.  Taxpayers want an answer as to the reason what the witnesses are saying here today is so completely at odds with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  In that regard, I put it to Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh, that NAMA's handling of Project Eagle was at best sloppy and unprofessional and at worst rushed and opportune.  Again, this is just my reading of it.  <\/p><p>Obviously, the witnesses accept there are fundamental differences between what they are saying here today and what is contained in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report but do they accept the Comptroller and Auditor General was professional in the manner in which he conducted his report and in that regard do they accept his professional experience and that of his team in compiling this report?<\/p><p>That would also encompass his bona fides in respect of this report and the conclusions he has made therein.  Mr. Daly said, in respect of the &pound;190 million, that the Comptroller and Auditor General had a misplaced attachment to an accounting value rather than a real world value.  I find that to difficult to reconcile when no proper valuations were procured at all.  Mr. Daly also says, in the context of the open process not leading to advantage, that there were eight out of ten rejected bidders post-2014.  Why were these not deemed credible?  What criteria were used?<\/p><p> Mr. Daly went on to mention reputational damage caused by media leaks, which are unfortunate.  Nevertheless, more damage has been done by the fact that the sale went through and we now find ourselves discussing the matter at this public forum.  I do not accept what Mr. Daly says regarding reputational damage.  Perhaps he can enlighten us in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#RR04600","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":1085,"content":"<p>I might share those questions with my colleagues if that is all right.

Remember there are six, seven or eight Comptroller and Auditor General's reports on NAMA, which we have never challenged, except on one narrow point.  Our net disagreement on this one is that property loan sales is a specialist area.

The report goes on to state:<\/p><blockquote>Following a special meeting of the NAMA board of 11 March 2014, a call was convened with PIMCO.  During a call later that evening (11 March 2014) PIMCO expressed its disappointment that disclosures of interest had not been made to NAMA.  PIMCO stated that it did not want to remain in a process that could be associated with impropriety for either PIMCO or NAMA and that it was willing to withdraw completely from the process.  The Head of Asset Recovery, Mr. Hanna, inquired about 'other options'.<\/blockquote> <p>He was not forcing anybody out of the game or asking them to leave.  When PIMCO asked what he meant by this the head of asset recovery asked if the deal could be &quot;shaped differently for the arrangement fee to come out&quot;.  He advised PIMCO that NAMA's concern was about the proposed success fee payable to Mr. Frank Cushnahan.  PIMCO's willingness to withdraw was again reiterated and in regard to a further conference call, the report states:<\/p><blockquote>Around 5 p.m. on the following day, 12 March, PIMCO advised NAMA that it had no option but to withdraw from the process.  The fee arrangement was a serious issue for it and NAMA.  PIMCO was unwilling to proceed in the absence of disclosures of interest it expected would have been made to NAMA, particularly given the quantum of the fee (&pound;15m to &pound;16m).  PIMCO further stated it could not see how any 'change' would allow the organisation to continue with the transaction.<\/blockquote> <p>So it left.  NAMA's head of legal expressed an appreciation of PIMCO's position and of the fact that alternatives had been considered.  She expressed disappointment but accepted the decision.<\/p><p>The synopsis of the Comptroller and Auditor General's examination of the conference calls and the communications seems to suggest something different from what Mr. Daly said in his earlier testimony from what he has said today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#UU00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":1161,"content":"<p>There are two footnotes, which the Deputy has not read out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#UU00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1162,"content":"<p>Mr. Daly can read them<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#UU00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":1163,"content":"<p>Footnote 1 states, &quot;NAMA has stated that the context for this question [about other options] was the conference call on 10 March during which PIMCO said that if its disclosure was an issue was an issue for NAMA, PIMCO would need to consider if the transaction could be progressed without the proposed recipients of the success fee.

Again, NAMA took no action.  While PIMCO had the sense to get out of Dodge City when they saw there was a problem, Mr. Daly and his organisation continued with the process, even though they were aware of what was happening and aware of the arrangement between PIMCO and the three actors involved in the success fees.  The charge from the Comptroller and Auditor General is that NAMA did not carry out due diligence but relied on letters of comfort from Cerberus around whether or not anybody associated with NAMA would benefit and did not drill down into the matter, which is what I am trying to do here.  I am trying to be fair to Mr. Daly and to understand his thinking but he did not ask Mr. Cushnahan about when there would be fixers or success fees or how he would be paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#UU01000","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":1168,"content":"<p>We did ask him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#UU01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1169,"content":"<p>There will be no supplementary questions.

This was too slow in terms of NAMA's lifecycle.  We were putting a lot of pressure on the debtors to put assets on the market and do other things such as secure rental income to us.  This is part of the process we do with all of our debtors whether in the North, the South, the UK or wherever else.  These debtors were dragging their heels.  They were coming up with all sorts of reasons that they did not want to sell the assets.  We were getting very frustrated by this.  We have a formal review of every debtor twice a year and the big debtors come to a decision-making authority.  The biggest debtor goes to the board, the next biggest debtors go to the credit committee and the next layer of debtors go to me and somebody else.  Nobody in NAMA can control anything as an individual.  There must always be more than one person in terms of reviewing a debtor's case.  The reality was that towards the end of 2013, we were at frustration point with some of the bigger debtors in the portfolio.  We had this opportunity to sell the portfolio as a whole, but if we did not sell the portfolio we would have been going down the enforcement route.  Obviously, I cannot discuss individual debtors here, but the Comptroller and Auditor General can look at it.  On the files of some of the biggest debtors, it is clearly documented that effectively the debtors were not co-operating.  They were missing their milestones and sales targets.  We were then in a process, which we were obliged to do legally, of having fair procedures with debtors where we have to write to them and state they missed their milestones and give them an opportunity to fix that, and if they do not fix that we propose alternative action.  Alternative action usually leads to enforcement unless the debtor accedes to it.  That is the reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#ZZ02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1338,"content":"<p>I will move on to Lazard and its engagement with NAMA.

There was a change in the loan sale market in late 2014 and 2015.  Bidders said they were spending a load of money on bidding on portfolios, not just with NAMA but with everybody else, and there is only one winner.  They said that to reduce bid costs sellers of portfolios had to put more data into the data room.  It was not NAMA that decided this; this is the way the loan sales market developed.  As part of this, additional documents had to be put into the data room about, as I said in answer to the previous question, engagement with the debtors, what type the debtors were, had the debtors met their milestones or were they missing milestones.  These were the extra documents which went in, and this had changed between the time Project Eagle was on the market and Project Arrow was on the market.  Another fundamental difference which happened was that to get buyers for a portfolio, the seller had to commission loan sale valuations and put them into the data room.  Sellers did not have to do this at the time of the Project Eagle process.  This happened about a year later, when the loans sales market changed.  Bidders were spending so much money on bids and they asked why should they bid any more and they needed to reduce their due diligence costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#AAA01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1350,"content":"<p>I want to focus on the discount rate.

Again, it was a granular portfolio, much the same as Project Eagle, and it went on the market about a year and a half later.  Even though interest rates had come down and people were seeking yields, we were advised by Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield, a completely different broker, that effectively we should expect to discount the cash flows at about 15%.

I can see today that assets which have the HSE as a tenant in a 30 year lease are going at a discount of 7%.  They have a 30 year covenant, and there is a harp on that lease.  Effectively, they are State leases, and they are going at a 7% yield, and some even slightly higher.

That was for the best asset, which was the Dundrum shopping centre.  The truth of it is that if one takes what is now trading in the market, in 2016, which is a better market, with the HSE as a tenant, they can be transacted on the market at about a 7% discount on the cash flows.

He says it was not a well-designed sale process, \"This sales process does not give me confidence that the best price was achieved and that there was not another process available.\"  Despite the fact that NAMA has questions about the expertise of his staff or the fact that they did not engage outside expertise, he has robustly defended his position and the findings he produced for the members of the committee to make their summation.<\/p> <p>  While NAMA has come out today with a fighting spirit, why, if it was such a good deal and everything is in order, do we have, as Deputy Aylward has said, the Taoiseach not accepting it and the Government going down on the issue of price in terms of an inquiry?

We should sell assets and pay down the NAMA-Government guaranteed bonds as quickly as possible because they are a strain on Government finances.<\/p> <p>  The only way we can pay off the NAMA bonds is by selling assets.  Collecting income is fine and we held assets for several years in the early stage, particularly in Ireland because we felt they were too cheap but we probably sold more into the market.

If the debtor will not co-operate we have to engage in enforcement if we want to get control of the asset to sell it.

There was, as I understand it at the time, presentations, indeed pressure from the Northern Ireland Executive to appoint a NAMA board member from Northern Ireland to represent Northern Ireland interests.  The Minister at the time - certainly, it would always have been NAMA's view - took the view that board members would not be appointed to represent particular sectoral interests or any other interests.  They would be appointed solely in terms of the broad skill-set and expertise that was needed for the board.  The representations and the pressure continued - I suppose, we are back again into the North-South sensitivity area - and the Minister decided that what we would do is create an advisory committee.  That was the origin of the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee.

Mr. Daly wrongly says that the problem was all on the buyer's side and that there was no problem on the seller's side.

Mr. Daly then discovered further down the line that he is more than conflicted in terms of his relationship with PIMCO.

Whether he agrees with it or not, everything is substantiated, and the report is based on the facts as they could have been ascertained.  As the fellow says, you can have your own views but you cannot have your own facts.  One of the challenges in dealing with Mr. Daly is that, however we structure our discussions to get to the point where we acknowledge that a decision, for example, was not taken at the board to tell PIMCO to hit the road - he may have had reservations; he may have had a discussion - nowhere is it documented that the board resolved that PIMCO had to go.

I know it has been a long day, but it is important for us to try to tease out as much of this as possible.  I will pick up where I left off earlier with Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh.  Some of this has been teased out.  I want to come back to it again because I think it is important.  Mr. Daly said earlier that people have moved away from the pricing issue.  I focused on the conflicts of interest and the success fees because this aspect of the matter is at the heart of the question of whether process was followed appropriately.  A big part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report relates to the failings he has detected in this regard.  The witnesses from NAMA might not agree with these findings.  We had a lengthy discussion about the minutes of the board meeting of 11 March, at which the conference call of the previous day was discussed.  Mr. Daly's view on that issue contradicts the synopsis of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as set out in Appendix E in the report.  Mr. Daly's interpretation or narrative is that the board decided that the message which had to be conveyed, and which was conveyed, was that PIMCO was out.  Let us imagine for a second that this is the case.  I do not accept that it is, but let us take it at face value.  If this is the case, Mr. Daly is saying he was alarmed by the success fees that, according to him, involved Mr. Cushnahan.<\/p> <p>  If the witnesses want to turn to page 17 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, they will see that he makes it clear in finding 55 that his problem with the success fee does not relate solely to the payment to Mr. Cushnahan.  He argues that \"all of the payment &ndash; not just the payment to Mr Cushnahan &ndash; should have raised concerns for NAMA\".  That is what he says.  The concerns that I, like other people, think should have been raised were obviously not raised.  It stretches people's imagination to unbelievable levels.  NAMA wants us to believe that the board was so concerned about the success fees that it forced PIMCO out, but the process continued regardless after it became aware that Brown Rudnick and Tughans were also involved with Cerberus.  A decision was made to carry on.  NAMA is relying on an e-mail, correspondence or letter of comfort from Cerberus.  We need to see that e-mail.  We also need to see the correspondence where NAMA wrote to Cerberus.  The witnesses are saying that NAMA told them everything was okay because nobody from NAMA and nobody who had been associated with NAMA was involved in any success fee.  Questions are being asked about why NAMA did not go further - we have been told that alarm bells went off - by going beyond Cerberus and finding out from Brown Rudnick or Tughans whether Mr. Cushnahan was involved at that point.  Given that NAMA knew they shared an office with Cushnahan and Tughans, it is extraordinary to ask us to believe it was not reasonable for us to suggest that NAMA should have acted in a more appropriate way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016092900002#LLL05400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475136000,"counter":1792,"content":"<p>As I said earlier, our contractual relationship was with Cerberus.

Mr. Daly has already established and he accepts that NAMA was made aware of the success fees with PIMCO.  He knew that those success fees were broken into three parts - for Brown Rudnick, for Tughans and for Mr. Cushnahan.  He was also aware that there was a relationship between Mr. Cushnahan and Tughans whereby the former shared office space with the latter and that a number of NIAC meetings were held at that same premises.  Mr. Daly wants us to believe that when NAMA was made aware of the PIMCO success fee, it was so damaging that PIMCO had to be forced out of the process.  He also wants us to accept that we should not really be concerned that Tughans and Brown Rudnick were involved in success fees with Cerberus.  The other point is that there was only a three-week gap between the PIMCO withdrawal and NAMA being made aware on 3 April of the success fees relating to the Cerberus deal.  It was not as if the process took place over six months or a year - it was a three-week period.  Mr. Daly went on to say that the net issue for NAMA was whether it would allow Mr. Cushnahan's alleged manoeuvrings in Belfast to seriously damage the interests of Irish taxpayers.  Mr. Daly said the interests of Irish taxpayers took precedence and that there was a commercially compelling case for selling the portfolio.

Lazard was kept in the dark about all of that because the minutes of the board meeting indicate that Lazard would be informed after the meeting of the outcome of the decision in April that the bid was being accepted.

Given that 3 April was the key date when NAMA decided about Lazard, why did it rush it so quickly at an <i>ad hoc<\/i>meeting when only person could be there physically?

Members are aware of the ongoing effort by the Houses of the Oireachtas to improve the engagement of Government Departments and public bodies with the committees in terms of how voted expenditure is dealt with.  In that context, it has been agreed to hold a mid-year review process of the Department's Estimate - Vote 26 - as well as a consideration of the 2017 expenditure proposals.  Briefing documents for today's meeting have been circulated to members.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting with the Minister is to discuss improvements that may be desirable in respect of the performance information included in that Estimate, a mid-year review of the position regarding outputs and expenditure relating to the 2016 Estimate for the Department of Education and Skills and a briefing relating to the emerging position so as to permit the committee to participate in the 2017 Estimates discussions in advance of the allocations being finalised.<\/p> <p>  I propose that the Vote be examined on a selected programme basis.

Our mutual job is to champion education across the general view of the public as well as within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Education has a very strong case to make.<\/p> <p>  As members are aware, we produced the first action plan for education.<\/p><p>It is an attempt to meet what the Chairman outlined regarding having a clearer focus on outcomes and outputs that are of relevance to the committee and the public but also to introduce the concept of a major central vision, namely to be the best education service in Europe within a decade, built around five key goals with objectives, outcomes and actions under each.<\/p><p> I am convinced education is central to the twin objectives of Government to provide a sustainable path to full employment and to use our economic strength to deliver a fairer society.  I have come from the enterprise brief and the key issue for all companies nowadays is access to talent to innovate, to be entrepreneurial, to work in teams and to communicate.  That is where our long-term sustainable path to full employment lies and education is at the heart of that.  Education is again the only sector where one can genuinely on a permanent basis break down cycles of disadvantage to deliver a fair society.  Recently, the chief executive officer of the Peter McVerry Trust addressed my party's think-in and he talked about the challenges of homelessness.  The issue he put as No. 1 on the board for a ten-year homelessness strategy was ending school drop-outs.  Education is intimately linked to many of the issues central to our concerns.<\/p><p> We have a job to demonstrate to the Oireachtas and the wider public the central importance of what we do.  Equally, it is important that the debate on education should not focus exclusively on inputs but should also focus on how children are doing and how well we are progressing.  The action plan has a clear focus on how well are children progressing and how well we are succeeding in bringing them out of disadvantage and giving them opportunities; how well schools are preforming in terms of leadership, methodology of teaching, and their capacity to help children with mental health or resilience issues; and how well broader bridges are being built into the community, without which education can never succeed.  It is very much an intimate relationship between all the groups, including parents, enterprise, which provides outlets, and the many voluntary, community and public service organisations.  Producing a plan of this nature, which we intend to have renewed annually in order that the actions are not only subject to a timeline for this year and we are accountable for them, but that at the end of each year, there will be an opportunity to review with others and to say what is working and what is not and what needs to be changed.  That will create a dynamic of reform that will be helpful.<\/p><p> I am fortunate to head up a Department with immense experience, which runs a tight ship in terms of many of the indicators, but even the best run system can have the ambition to do better and that is clearly what we are doing.  There are tangible targets, which will be of interest to members such as bringing the retention rates in DEIS schools up to the same level as ordinary schools.  That will involve reducing the drop-out rate from approximately 19% to 10%.  It would be a significant improvement as we develop this plan.<\/p><p> The Department's budget is &euro;8.1 billion for current expenditure and &euro;600 million for capital expenditure.  A huge feature of current expenditure is the 80% devoted to pay.  We employ 101,000 whole-time equivalents and we reach more than 1.5 million learners in some dimension or other.  We are, therefore, an employment intensive operation and we depend on the quality, drive and leadership of that group.<\/p><p> The committee asked about pressures.  There clearly are pressures on our budget, including demand and the need to improve services.  Specific pressures this year include the number of retirements, which will cost approximately &euro;50 million, and the need to provide funding for 860 SNAs who took up posts last month.  There are always continuing pressures on the capital budget in respect of building and responding to demographic pressures.  There has been a substantial increase in the budget for special educational needs over the past 15 years.  The total allocation now is &euro;1.5 billion and substantial investment has been made in resource teachers and SNAs and this is designed to focus on the needs of children with special educational needs.  The allocation of resources is based on models of assessment as well as general learning allocations and I am happy to discuss that.<\/p><p> Schools investment is the big driver of capital expenditure.  There has been a substantial increase in the number of pupils attending both primary and secondary school.  This year, the new builds are anticipated to provide 20,000 additional schools at both levels.  At any given time, there are 66 major projects under construction and approximately 50 will be completed this year.  It is a supply chain moving along all the time with different gateways in the approval process ranging from schools being put on the list to being released to tender and going to construction.<\/p><p> Looking to the future, given the backdrop of &euro;600 million being available across all Departments for discretionary spending in the upcoming budget, the pressure to meet all their needs is difficult.  That is true in my area as well.  A demographic uplift is built into the no policy change provision of our Estimate and, therefore, &euro;103 million has been set aside to meet the increasing pupils numbers at first and second level but that only refers to PTR and capitation.  The Lansdowne Road agreement will add &euro;130 million to our budget, which is provided for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#A01000","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1872,"content":"<p>Is that included in the &euro;600 million?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#B00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1873,"content":"<p>No, that is included as part of the no policy change expenditure.

The Minister is correct that this committee will try to champion all things educational.  We must also hold the Minister and his officials to account, which is why he is here today.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise a number of specific issues, although we could go on all day discussing the Estimates.  On the question of demographics, is the Minister satisfied that the Department has a handle on the cost of demographic changes and the services that will be required because of those changes?  I am not convinced that the Department is planning far enough ahead in terms of demographics or that, in the context of the Estimates, costs could not arise unexpectedly in certain areas because secondary schools, in particular, were not planned early enough.  The Department got away lightly recently when, for example, the Franciscan College Gormanston went into the free sector a few years earlier than the Department believed was necessary.  In fact, it was necessary when it happened.  I have seen that happen before and I worry about it in the context of future expenditure.<\/p> <p>  How well funded is the new action plan?  How dependent is the plan on funding for full implementation?  What does the Minister mean by the best education services in Europe?  What is his metric?  Is it the service that is best funded, the one with the best PISA scores or the best pupil-teacher ratio?  What does the Minister feel are the metrics upon which this should be judged?<\/p> <p>  Industrial relations is obviously a major issue and there is a massive increase in the Estimates for in-service teacher training.  I understand that this relates to various curriculum changes at junior certificate level as well as to other issues.  However, one major teacher's union is not taking part at all.  What effort is the Department making to ensure that the money is spent efficiently on training as many teachers as possible for the new courses?  While it is not directly related to the Estimates, I ask the Minister to comment on students being penalised by 10% in the junior certificate on foot of the ongoing industrial relations issue, particularly those in ASTI schools.  The Department is spending all of this money on teacher training but ASTI members are not officially taking part the reform programme and their students are going to lose out.  Given the amount of money being spent, I presume it would just be a case of putting more people into those training centres.<\/p> <p>  An issue arose last year and I ask the Minister to clarify the position in respect of it.  The issue in question is referred to in the departmental notes and relates to tax settlements between the Department and the Revenue Commissioners and between the State Examinations Commission and the Revenue Commissioners, which are quite unprecedented.  The notes do not specify what, if any, element of these settlements represent penalties and interest.  The sums were substantial, with the State Examinations Commission settlement amounting to &euro;10 million or &euro;11 million and the Department's to just over &euro;1 million.  That is a great deal of money.  Obviously, the tax was always due and had to be paid.  I would not dispute that.  However, I would be very disappointed if I learned that much of it was penalties and interest.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position in respect of that issue.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the &euro;100 million in so-called \"smoothing\" under the Stability and Growth Pact on the capital side, the Minister has said that it must come in by way of a Supplementary Estimate later in the  year.  I understood that there would not be any more Supplementary Estimates from any Department at this stage of the year but I am sure the Minister will explain to me how that is possible.  Has that &euro;100 million been spent already or has the Minister yet to announce on what it will be spent?  <\/p> <p>  It appears that an extraordinary amount of money was spent by the Department on legal fees.  The total is projected to be more than &euro;6 million this year.  I know that expenditure on legal fees was in the range of &euro;5 million last year and the year before, although it was projected to be much less.  How many lawyers are employed in the Department?  I ask this in the context of what seem to be extraordinarily high legal costs.<\/p> <p>  Will I be able to come back in later to ask some questions about next year's budget?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#C00400","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1879,"content":"<p>Yes.

The graph on page 6 of the summary document shows an 11% to 45% variability in increase.  Why can we not forecast more accurately?  What data are we missing?  The target figure, for example, for SNAs in 2015 was 11,330 but the number of SNAs reached by December of 2015 was 12,036.  What is the Department basing its targets on?  Are the targets needs based?  It is quite clear that the demands on the service are continuing to outpace the resources available.  I ask the Minister to take steps to address the continuing uncertainty about the allocation of SNAs and, in particular, the timeline for the publication of allocations in advance of the next school year.  This is a perennial problem which makes life very difficult for school principals, SNAs, students and parents.  <\/p> <p>  Also under programme A, I wish to refer to the output indicator for the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  The indicator holds that a NEPS psychologist is to be assigned to all ordinary national and second-level schools.  The indicator does not tell us how we are doing in that regard.  Are we meeting demand?  What are the waiting lists like?  Is every child who needs access to the service getting it within a certain timeframe?

I ask him to be as proactive in education and to have the vision and commitment to do something similar here to ensure that our children have access to the required amount of trained psychologists and counsellors so that their well being is looked after.<\/p> <p>  I am very disappointed to see no reference whatsoever to resilience in the Estimates.  I have spoken to the Minister about this in person.  We need to ensure that our children have a toolbox of skills to cope at times of crisis.  A rounded education is of paramount importance for our children.  I am aware that some secondary schools are doing excellent work in this regard - involving Headstrong, Jigsaw and so forth - where vulnerable teenagers are targeted and their psychological needs addressed.  Unfortunately, however, such programmes are sporadic.  They must be further developed and designed by experts.  We must also consider making such programmes available in primary schools.  A more uniform approach is needed in this area.  We must move away from a situation where resilience is squeezed into the school day through the efforts of particular teachers who have possibly taken time out and paid for training in this area towards a whole-school approach.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister to consider reversing the decision made in the 2012 budget to remove the ex-quota guidance allocation in second level schools.  Cuts to such services reduce that crucial, easy access for teenagers when they are in trouble.  That decision had a very unequal impact because many schools were able, through parental contributions, to pay for private counsellors.  It was the DEIS schools and the disadvantaged students who were crying out for help who had their only trained counsellors taken away.  I ask the Minister to consider that as key to the well-being of our children.<\/p><p> I note that the provision of additional resource teachers is not included - it is on page 18.  Yet there is a reference to a new model which would cost &euro;24 million in 2017, with a full year cost of &euro;72 million.  Why is this vital resource not included?<\/p><p> At the end of his presentation, the Minister mentioned the &euro;130 million relating to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Is that the money needed to uphold the recent agreement with two of the teacher unions?  Is there potential provision if agreement is reached with ASTI?

The Department has approximately 300 different planning areas, on which projections of emerging needs are made.  Obviously, at second level we are informed by the flow through in those areas of children in existing schools and the pattern they have adopted of the schools they go to and where pressures may emerge.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right; there is always capacity to improve here.  One of the features is the small-area data now available from the census, which is certainly enhancing our capacity to plan.  That is particularly true when we come to areas such as special educational need that Deputy Catherine Martin raised.  Both of those publications are available on the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service website.  I know the Deputy has had examples and I am sure Mr. Tom Plunkett and his colleagues would be happy to look at particular examples if she feels there are issues.<\/p> <p>  There will always be a problem that people might want to go to a particular school but there is capacity in another school.  The Department is under pressure to ensure that there are seats for every pupil at a time of growing numbers.  It is necessary to use planning areas and look at the overall capacity versus the demand within that area rather than looking at a school that is showing very rapidly rising enrolments and another that is suffering falling enrolments.  One cannot plan while ignoring the capacity elsewhere in the system.  In this area, the Department's system on the capital side has improved steadily over the years.  The constraint is cash and not planning.  The Department has brought many projects to a state of readiness so that if money is available it will always be used.<\/p> <p>  The action plan is clearly a statement of strategy specifically for the next three years, but also with a longer-term vision going out ten years.  Obviously, it will be dependent on annual budgeting; that is the reality in terms of input.  The committee is today examining our spend of &euro;8.7 billion between current and capital expenditure.  There is an important element of ensuring that the impact of that is maximised in the various headings, such as special education and disadvantage.  While there is always an important focus on the incremental change possible in any one year, it is just as important to ensure the &euro;8.7 billion we spend is spent to the maximum effect as it is to compete for the what is only &euro;600 million available for the coming year.  The action plan looks to deliver more effectively within existing programmes.  Many of the actions are about how we improve.<\/p> <p>  In terms of judging the best education system, we have set out five separate goals each of which has target outcomes to pursue.  Those would be the types of targets in which we would be looking to see improvement.  There are international ratings, some of which are very narrow in their interpretation.  However, we would, for example, be looking at improvements in literacy and numeracy, and science would be a key element.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at our capacity to meet skills gaps as they emerge.  We are looking at progression of young people from disadvantaged areas or disadvantaged groups through to higher education.  We are looking at how quickly we deliver an apprenticeship and traineeship model that would compete with the models in some of the countries that are really strong in this area.  I am convinced that we need a strong and well respected apprenticeship and trainee sector which was devastated in the crash and needs to be not only rebuilt in the narrow frame that it operated, which was the traditional skills, but also made a route for progression in many other areas of services and goods.  There is a comprehensive list.<\/p> <p>  On the industrial relations issue, the Deputy is right in saying that the ASTI has not participated in the roll-out of the new junior certificate English syllabus which is coming to its final examination for that cohort of children in June.  That is extremely unfortunate.  I have met representatives of the ASTI and my officials continue to meet them.

It is public policy and is being rolled out in all schools.  One of the unions has decided not to engage, which is very unfortunate.  We are continuing to engage with that union.<\/p><p>In respect of the Deputy's specific concern, we have invited the ASTI to consider lifting its blocking of the English element in particular so that students coming to their exams in June will not be handicapped.  The terms of assessment of this curriculum were set many years ago.  It was agreed with all the unions at that time and it is established public policy.  <\/p><p> On the issue of tax settlements, there was one on travel and subsistence payments.  No penalties were involved; there was tax and interest.  An exemption was granted for these payments for 2016 in the Finance Act so the practice is one that is provided for in the Finance Act.  The remainder was in respect of home tutors who were paid directly through our payroll.  No penalties were effected.  All home tutors are now paid on our payroll and are fully tax compliant.  <\/p><p> The &euro;100 million in respect of capital was allocated.  The smoothing refers to the way in which the EU rules treat capital so that if one spends &euro;100 million in new capital, the financial space absorbed by it is only &euro;25 million in year one.  It is an incentive within the EU rules for capital spending.  A provision was made to take advantage of that which allowed &euro;100 million extra for us.  I understand it will have to be provided and we are in discussion with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It can be met by savings elsewhere in capital budgets.  <\/p><p> I will get the committee a note on the legal fees; I do not have it to hand.  On Deputy Catherine Martin's point about special needs assistants, the provision of both special needs assistants and resource teachers is somewhat different in that it depends on the profile of the intake of pupils in a particular year.  The assessment is done through the local special education needs organiser, SENO, working with the school.  Some of those allocations are based on very specific assessments submitted for individual pupils against which a provision of either an SNA or resource teaching hours has to be made.  There cannot be an accurate prediction of that ahead of the children presenting, having the assessments and the assessments being presented.  Some of them will be appealed and will go back to the National Council for Special Education.  The fact that there are 860 extra SNAs provided this year does not reflect some major breakdown in estimation or failure to meet demand.  This is a demand-led scheme where provision follows the demand.  It is much like some of the demand-led schemes that exist in other Departments.  That creates an issue in terms of budgeting because it does not come in automatically as a demographic in our scenario of no policy change.  We have to assess the need in the course of the year and make provision for it.  We anticipate what it will be and make a provision for it but the actual accurate provision is only made ahead of the September allocation.  <\/p><p> I take the Deputy's point about timelines for schools to know what their allocation will be.  There is now work on a revised programme for allocating resource teachers, which seeks to respond to the work done by Eamon Stack of the NCSE and have a model that is not so dependent on assessments being submitted.  The committee probably knows that in disadvantaged areas kids might find it much harder to get assessment than in other areas.  The system tends to favour those who have the psychological assessment submitted.  The move to the new model would have less reliance on those types of assessments and would have a more whole-school approach but would also guarantee that no child loses out.  It has been piloted in 47 areas.  As the Deputy rightly said, what is under consideration now is the possibility of mainstreaming that which will be more costly in the initial years but will provide a better model for it.<\/p><p> I understand the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, does not deal with every child's demand.  The process in NEPS is to seek to support schools and it will only come in for individual children where a particular requirement has been identified.  It seeks to allocate protected time to the DEIS schools where it anticipates the need is greatest.  It is widely recognised that it is an area in which we need to invest more.  There is commitment in the programme for Government to increase the provision by 25%.  The same can be said of counselling where we have a commitment to increase provision.  There is an allocation this year and there is also a commitment in the confidence and supply agreement to increase counselling.  This is an area that it has been recognised has had an adverse impact and we are looking to work towards its restoration over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#D01700","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1905,"content":"<p>On that issue, Minister-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#E00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1906,"content":"<p>The Deputy should address her questions through the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#E00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1907,"content":"<p>May I ask a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#E00400","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1908,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#E00500","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1909,"content":"<p>If those hours are restored to the counsellors, would it be for the school to decide where those hours go?

The allocation this year, which came into effect on 1 September, is not ex quota so the principal has some discretion in deciding on the allocation.  The issue that has to be decided going forward is whether we should move to restore an ex quota provision.  There are arguments on both sides of that which the Deputy has probably heard.  A decision would have to be reached on that.  Some would argue that counselling is a whole-school activity and should not be confined to one individual but one could say that counsellors are professionally trained and counselling should be delivered by people who have that training and it should be protected ex quota.  That issue is there.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy that we need to invest more in resilience.  Our commitment in NEPS and counselling in the programme for Government is very much building on that.  While there may be no reference in the documentation, one will see that in the education action plan we have very much centred on that.  There is work going on in my Department auditing what we are already doing and looking at how we can have a better impact.  Apart from the allocation of extra resources, we are rolling out the well-being programme at junior certificate level which is a 400-hour programme.  It has been very well designed.  The exemplars the Deputy describes are really good.  In many ways all these solutions cannot be designed in Marlborough Street and it will depend on exemplars of good practice.  We depend very much on community engagement in programmes like this for them to be successful.  They are to be welcomed and hopefully built upon.  This morning I launched a first-aid kit to help coaches in clubs or teachers in schools to recognise the early signs of mental health stress in players or pupils and to be able to respond appropriately.

Is the &euro;610 million current expenditure and &euro;250 million capital expenditure all available for new projects or is it simply precommitted?  I was delighted there were so many references to disadvantage in the action plan and in the report but, in the Estimates, there is a gaping hole where third level should be.  I understand that responding to demographic pressures at second level is vital but if we are not ready at third level, what are we preparing children for?  Are we really looking to progress young people to third level education without adequate education at the other end?  The bulk of the capital spend is on primary and secondary level and there is zero vision for third level in relation to capital.<\/p> <p>  It is extremely important for some provisions to be made in the 2017 Estimates on the basis that we will be assessing the Cassells report.

What chance does third level stand if there are no provisions in the Department's Estimates and SFI drags funding from the PRTLI but does not expend moneys on infrastructure?  If we want to attract FDI, especially in the wake of Brexit with the possibility that we will see academics and Horizon 2020 research funding move here, where will we put them?  Where will the laboratories be?  There is no indication of funding for spaces for that purpose.  We are lucky that, in the wake of Brexit, we will be the only English-speaking country in the EU.

Resources are available to schools when a child is diagnosed with dyscalculia but the Department and schools seem very slow to respond and recognise this in comparison to cases of dyslexia.  Numeracy can be a big barrier to progression to third level so can the Department fund assessments for dyscalculia with a view to making the resources available to affected people?  In this was to happen we would improve the rates of people from poorer backgrounds going to third level education and positively affect the study of science.  The Department is interested in developing STEM subjects but we will not reach any of the targets if we do not realise that dyscalculia is just as prominent as dyslexia.<\/p> <p>  On page 5 of the report on the special needs assistance scheme it refers to CSO demographic projections but also to those of the Department.  Are both bodies doing separate projections on demographics?  Why would that be the case?  Why can we not just focus on the CSO, given that it is the experienced body doing this work?

I support what Deputy Catherine Martin said about the special needs assistant, SNA, allocation.  It is a valid point and I appreciate the Minister's response.  There is more to it than the Department having to wait until the schools complete their enrolment to know what allocation is needed.  Typically, the only enrolment that changes is in junior infants.  It can change in other classes but usually the other seven classes will remain more or less unchanged.  There is an issue for children.  If we are to go to a child-centred model of education there is an issue for children because many teachers who have been in a school for a while are moved unnecessarily because the allocation does not happen until October.  There are too many changes in the teachers teaching students things like gross and fine motor skills.  Children build up a rapport with the teacher who has a programme and prepares an individual education plan, IEP.  There is then an unnecessary changeover of personnel and another teacher has to come in, follow a previous teacher's IEP and build up a new relationship with and understanding of the child.  It is having an impact on the children's learning and welfare.  In this day and age the Department should have the wherewithal to overcome that difficulty and find the means of allocating the resources for children with special learning needs before October.  I feel very strongly about that.  I wrote to the Minister and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, this year to make a plea on behalf of a parent for a student who was going to be affected by this very issue and I was told there was no facility or flexibility, which I deeply regret.  We have to have a more child-centred attitude.  In this day and age we should have the wherewithal to make that allocation.  Perhaps a supplementary allocation could be made afterwards but allocations should be done earlier in the year.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is something I have raised with the Minister by way of parliamentary question.  It concerns the teachers' unions and the pay awards happening at the moment.  If teachers choose not to be members of a union, it is their right and entitlement for which they should be respected and they should not be punished for it.  In the secondary school sector, unless teachers are members of the TUI they cannot avail of certain conditions even if they are willing to sign up to the new procedures and arrangements.  They cannot avail of the improved conditions unless they are members of the union.  That is the Department forcing teachers to become members of a union by stealth.  I find it perplexing.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on it and to see what can be done.  I do not support punishing a teacher for not being a member of a union.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne talked about legal fees in the Department.  I received a reply to a parliamentary question from the Minister recently which outlined the legal fees expended by the universities in the last number of years defending cases involving staff.  In the past 12 months, the amount the third level sector has spent defending cases involving its staff has trebled.  This is a sector that is starved of finance and is highly vulnerable in that regard yet it is spending millions of euro on legal fees.  What are the Minister's thoughts on the fact that in one year, the sector has trebled the amount of money it has spent on legal fees involving its own staff?  What is the Department thinking?  Does it have any appetite to further investigate the underlying reasons for the number of cases emerging in the courts involving staff at third level?  Has the trend been noticed by the Department?<\/p> <p>  The Ombudsman for Children launched his report yesterday in which he referred to the Department's overly hands-off approach and a recalibration of responsibility from the Department back to schools.  The Minister is aware it is a tune I have been singing for a long time now.  I welcome the Ombudsman for Children's conclusion, which is what I have been saying for several years now.  Will the Minister comment on how he or the Department would approach that recalibration of responsibility as referred to by the ombudsman yesterday?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#G00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1927,"content":"<p>I will hand back to the Minister now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#G00400","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1928,"content":"<p>I will address Senator Ruane's point first.  I would welcome any suggestions to make the Estimates easier to understand.  I have spent most of my life on the Senator's side of the table and I fully appreciate her point.  We have been trying to make it better.  What goes into the REV, the Estimates book, is something that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does right across the whole system.  We would be very anxious to work with the Senator to have better presentation and more meaningful output indicators or whatever is needed.  Our action plan for education will give a set of outcomes that we are tracking.  On the data requirement, one does not get all the data one would like on outcomes the way one does with inputs because they are not so well established.  We can report on inputs very accurately every quarter.  With regard to how the money is allocated, there is what is called no policy change.  That involves some decisions taken by Government that had a funding element and are in place.  Such decisions would be in the no policy change allocation.  If one looks at the Estimates one will see the &euro;500 million allocated in June to health is carried into the 2017 Estimates.  There is also the issue of demographics, which is carried in.  The &euro;610 million is predominantly for new initiatives but not exclusively because there are some elements such as the negotiation of changes in the Lansdowne Road agreement that are not provided for in those.  There are some policy elements, as we were just discussing, around resource teaching and SNAs and because they are demand-led they are not provided in the same way.  It is a mixture of momentum that is already clear and new initiatives.  It is not all new initiatives in simple terms.<\/p> <p>  The extent of the difference between first and second level and third level surprised me coming in.  In first and second level there are pupil-teacher ratios, PTRs, demographics and capital programmes but that is not true of higher education.  The Cassells report has underlined that the model used in recent years, where State provision was reduced at third level to protect primary and secondary level, is not a sustainable way to go on.  While initially they were able to expand numbers and take in new students, the system is now creaking and we need to look to the future.  That is where Cassells has come in.  I look forward to coming back to the committee.  <\/p> <p>  While there is a short-term need and we must fight for resources for higher education as best we can in the Estimates process, the Cassells report is looking at a longer perspective and is going right out 15 years.  It throws up the issue of how we have a sustainable funding model for the sector.  While I will be fighting for resources for third level, in addition to many other important areas which the Deputy also dealt with, the issue with the Cassells report is whether we can agree some sort of a long-term funding model that would be sustainable.  He has thrown up the issue of whether we should be looking beyond the Exchequer, where education has to compete with health, housing and all the others, and whether there should be some other sources of funding.  Members have different views on it so I will not go into those today.  As my Department does not have primary responsibility for Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, or the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, I cannot fully answer for the extent to which PRTLI versus SFI influences the mix of provision.  <\/p> <p>  There are programmes specifically aimed at attracting new academics to locate in Ireland.  Our Department is involved in the roll-out of Innovation 2020, which is one of the areas where potential initiatives could be competing for funding.  <\/p> <p>  As for the international education strategy, there are about 33,000 students in higher education and approximately 100,000 are doing teaching English as a foreign language, TEFL, courses.<\/p><p>The ambition is to further grow those areas.  Both have been significant growth areas in recent years, and Enterprise Ireland, EI, is a key player in that.  I will go on a trade mission to China next month promoting Ireland as a location and virtually all the institutes of education will be on that mission.  This is very much an integrated area of activity.  EI is the front marketing element.  It has created a common brand to promote it and it is looking to better quality controls, particularly in the English language area, for the future.  There are many stakeholders involved and we can provide more information on that.<\/p><p> I have taken the Senator's point on dyscalculia.  I understand it is recognised as an area of difficulty.  It is described in the jargon as high incidence rather than low incidence, but in that respect it is in the same category as dyslexia.  I will certainly ask the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, whether that is an element the system is not adequately addressing.  I understand that being a high-incidence phenomenon, it is provided for in what the NCSE calls the learning support, which is a 20% uplift of teacher numbers in each school.  It is from that 20% that, generally, needs of that nature are to be addressed rather than the individual assessment that drives the allocation of a special needs assistant, SNA, to a pupil or whatever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#G00500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1930,"content":"<p>It is not recognised as being the same as dyslexia because if it was, provisions would be made for it in the leaving certificate in the same way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#H00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1931,"content":"<p>Right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#H00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1932,"content":"<p>There are no provisions made in the leaving certificate for someone with dyscalculia, therefore, there are no reduced points, even with a diagnosis from the Dyslexia Association of Ireland.

Efforts are being made to reform that area.  There has been criticism that accommodations at junior certificate level are often harder to get at leaving certificate level, which throws children into disarray, so to speak.  I will revert to the Senator on that.<\/p> <p>  On the difference between the projections, in simple terms, the Department has data on enrolments in the school.  It has a quality data set.  The CSO, in looking at the entire population and the number of children aged between zero and 15 years, does not have those forensic data.  Our data are different also in that we can identify a school whose children may not come from the immediate catchment; some of them may be coming from quite a distance.  We have data, and using CSO data also, we can identify where they are coming from.  They are different data sets, and ours shed light that is helpful to planning.  We do not just rely on the CSO data.<\/p> <p>  I take Deputy Jim Daly's point.  In simple terms, I presume what happens is that the need for SNAs and resource teachers is a comparison between the junior infants coming in and the sixth class who are leaving.  What causes the increased demand for these allocations is based on the difference between the profile of those two classes.  One does not have a final view until one has received those data.  One could make a stab at it and say we expect 80% of the need of the junior infants to be similar to senior infants but I do not know whether that is a credible approach.  I am aware, however, that there is a new resource allocation model, which is designed to give greater certainty because it will be based on a wider and more predictable range of indicators.  The new model will ensure certainty in resource teacher allocations in future and will not be so dependent on the annual assessment-driven process.  That is one of the merits of it, and it would give-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#H00500","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1934,"content":"<p>When is that coming in?

It has been well received in the pilot schools, so we are keen to push on.<\/p> <p>  On the other issue the Deputy raised, it is based on collective agreements.  There is no obligation on an individual to join a union but it is normal practice in the public service that the decision of the trade union recognised as having representative rights for a particular grade or sector will determine the position for all relevant staff in that grade or sector.  This is not unique in the teaching area.  That is established custom and practice, and changing that would have far-reaching impacts across all industrial relations.

I do not have that level of assessment available to me as to what is driving cases and whether there are better ways of resolving them.  On the Deputy's final point about the comments of the Ombudsman for Children, which I have noted, debate in the D&aacute;il on the Deputy's own Bill has triggered the production of legislation I hope to bring before the committee on the parents and students charter.

We hope to bring forward legislation at the same time the Deputy's legislation is being considered by the committee in order that we can examine this issue in the whole.

I welcome what the Minister says about piloting the new scheme and the methodology relating thereto.  I hope it will be a big improvement.<\/p> <p>  Language is very important.  I get a sense, from the language he used, that the Minister has brought from his previous Department a mindset that uses terms such as \"access to talent\", \"education being at the heart\", \"preparing people for the workforce\", \"inputs\" and \"outputs\" as opposed to referring to students.  I am concerned about that type of language.  I know it is important to prepare people for the workforce but an educational system needs to prepare well-rounded citizens.  I would be concerned if the focus is primarily to push people into a points system to do certain courses in college in order to get certain degrees and then obtain certain types of jobs the end.  From my experience of working in several third level institutions, people choose the wrong courses because of that system.  They are then not prepared for the jobs for which they should be prepared.  I am concerned about preparing people for life, with social and personal development skills at second level.  I echo what Deputy Nolan said about guidance counsellors.  Teachers at second level all tell me they feel that if we are trying to prepare people vocationally, the students involved need much more guidance on their career and subject choices to prepare them for work.  Those who need extra support, whether from the perspective of maturity or life skills, need to be dealt with at second level in a better manner if possible.<\/p> <p>  The mental health of and stress for staff in schools have not been mentioned.  With high numbers in classrooms and the increased administrative burden on principals, they and staff come under a great deal of pressure.  Would the Minister comment on that?<\/p> <p>  He said there will be a fair number of retirements this year.  Will all of those people be replaced?  The Department unfortunately does not have a great record in recruiting people with Irish.  Apart from the teachers under the Department's remit, only 2% or 3% of the staff in the Department have a competency in the Irish language.  What steps are being taken to ensure that in the new recruitment process a certain quota will have that competency?  There is a knock-on effect on people through the system who are entitled to an education through Gaeilge trying to deal with the Department where previously there was a high standard and competency.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the Department has a policy on Gaeilge and the Gaeltacht and huge efforts have been made by certain individuals but the numbers have dipped substantially.<\/p><p> Yesterday, the Coalition for Publicly Funded Higher Education briefed us and representatives from Tallaght IT are before the committee.  I was told the moneys available to ITs this year for materials for practicals, etc., is so small that they have to cut back on doing practicals in certain vocational courses.  These are vital in preparing people who are going straight into the workplace.  They are unable to get the practical experience that was provided in previous years because of the lack of materials available to do the courses and that needs to be examined.<\/p><p> The ESRI figures for 2015 show that 23% of parents would choose to send their children to a Gaelscoil if it was available, yet Gaelscoileanna comprise only 6.7% of schools.  According to one school of thought, Gaelscoileanna are being impeded by the system the Department has for the allocation of moneys for capital projects.  Will the Minister address that?  A Gaelscoil could be an Educate Together or a catholic school.  Patronage is not necessarily an issue but there is huge demand for Gaelscoileanna, given 23% of parents would like one to be built in their area, but capital funding is not being provided to meet that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#J00600","speaker":"1377","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1947,"content":"<p>We have had a brief debate but we are waiting with bated breath for the Minister's reply to Senator Gallagher's question on the third level issue.  The third level sector is competing within the education budget, which, in turn, is competing with those of all other Departments.  According to the most recent OECD survey, average spending on education between 2008 and 2013 increased by 8% among its members but it is reduced by 7% in Ireland.  I wish the Minister well with his negotiations.  We have to fight harder to secure more resources for education at all levels.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult to measure educational outcomes because of the variation from school to school, region to region and in disadvantaged areas.  For example, schools may have put more of an emphasis on developing transversal skills.  We need to take on board the different types of outcomes to develop the well rounded individuals we want in our society.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made earlier to an emphasis on CoderDojo, science and maths but it is also hugely important to develop the humanities and the entire arts sphere.  In the context of demographics, Deputy Byrne mentioned how lucky Gormanstown College was to evolve and enter the free education sector.  We face a similar scenario in south Kildare and I welcome the engagement we have had with the Minister regarding the provision of a second level school.  The data show there is a need.  It is unfortunate that the Department is including a fee paying private school in the data.  Parents feel that is not correct.  The Minister mentioned that Mr. Plunkett is the expert on this and I would welcome the opportunity to take it up with him afterwards.<\/p> <p>  There is significant uncertainty in the projected special education figures.  Surely there should be more collaboration with the HSE and the Department of Health.  We are getting better figures and more information at an earlier stage in respect of children diagnosed with an intellectual or other disability.  Surely there should be some correlation in the data before children enter primary school.  We seem to be chasing a response to demand at that point in time.  Perhaps the Minister will explain the differences in the student to SNA ratio in different sectors.  For example, what are the targets for ratios in mainstream classes, special classes in mainstream schools, special schools, etc.?  There should be a greater emphasis on providing figures that are broken down by region given the complexity of the demographic changes nationwide.  Does the Minister have plans in the pipeline for 2017 that would allow for regional comparisons?<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister provide information to the committee about the delivery of new school places in 2016 and their timelines?  Have there been significant delays?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#K00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1948,"content":"<p>I will begin with Deputy Nolan's questions.  I have every reason to believe all the posts have been taken up and the cost will be met from the 2016 budget.  There will be a knock-on impact next year.  Approximately one third of the provision was made for this year and, therefore, the allocation will be trebled for 2017.<\/p> <p>  I take her point about guidance counsellors.  I recognise their role and the Deputy's preference for an ex quota approach.  That not been decided and I will take the committee's views on that into account.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Senator Gallagher that apprenticeships are hugely important.  Our long-term ambition is to have 13,000 traineeships and apprenticeships over the next five years.  There are currently 5,500, so it is an ambitious roll-out.  It is not only the number of traditional apprenticeships that will increase.  There is a recovery in this regard but the ambition is to increase the type of apprenticeship available from 27 to 100.  Three quarters of them will relate to entirely new areas.  We launched the first of them in Sligo for insurance and it is a level 8 apprenticeship.  We are driving that but it requires employer groups and trainers to sign up, and to meet QQI standards.  There is significant supply chain work to get one across the line.  This programme has funding implications and I will seek to fund it over the medium term.  It is substantially funded out of the national training fund.  I am confident we will drive this forward as rapidly as possible and meet the funding needs.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that schools perceive that the time taken from the beginning of the building process to its conclusion is too long but a number of initiatives have been developed to improve that.  Rapid is a design and build programme, which delivers urgent projects.  An accelerated architectural planning and tendering programme, ADAPT, has also been introduced to implement projects more quickly.<\/p><p>There is a need, and we have used public private partnership, PPP, packages.  We are trying to reduce a delivery chain of 36-42 months to 18 months in respect of some of those ADAPT and RAPID projects.  This is a significant shortening.  There is also a budgetary constraint.  Our Department does not underspend capital.  We have a supply chain that is sufficiently primed and invests every ha'penny that we get.  The Department has perfected that.  It is solid.<\/p><p> As to school transport, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, is not present, but a review is under way.  My understanding is that eligible students have automatic rights and comprise the bulk of those who are accommodated on school transport but that over the years, the number of so-called concessionary users has grown from a small number to a significant one.  The eligible students are the ones whose needs are guaranteed under the scheme.  When their numbers change, it can have a knock-on impact for concessionary users, who are effectively filling out unoccupied spaces.  This is the root of the problem.  There are issues with distances from schools and so on, but it is a national scheme and the same rules must apply in every county or it would be seen as unfair.  The review is trying to streamline the process to avoid letting people down where possible.  There are individual problems, but the process has worked reasonably well overall.<\/p><p> There has not been an 85% reduction in funding for higher education.  Is that the number that the Senator stated?  It is not accurate and a figure of 33% might be closer.  The figures are in the Cassells report.  Some of the reduction was made up by increasing student contributions.  Overall, one may say that the pot is static to declining somewhat while the ratio per student has reduced sharply because student numbers have increased substantially.<\/p><p> I do not have a predisposition towards how best to tackle this issue.  It is right that we sit down with committee members as practising politicians to tease out the proposed options.  One can produce arguments against any of the Cassells report's proposals, but we do not have the option of doing nothing.  Everyone present agrees that many of our country's ambitions are tied up with having a strong system of higher education that meets high standards and so on.  We will need to make some decisions in that regard.  Mr. Peter Cassells is making the case that, if it is solely down to the taxpayer to fund higher education, our aim will be difficult to realise in competition with all other sources of funding.  Do we embark on considering other sources of funding and, if so, what can people expect in return for contributing more?  The system of funding will need to be more transparent and we as politicians will need to design a longer-term strategy.  It is a question of us sitting down and trying to determine what progress can be made in that regard.<\/p><p> Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to special needs assistants, SNAs.  The issue of access to assessment is a clear flaw.  The merit of the new pilot model is that it reduces reliance on that assessment and is fairer to schools with a disadvantaged profile in their allocations.  It is fairer on two counts, in that it does not require assessments to be made for which schools might not have the resources and it recognises the more complex needs that their pupils generally have.  The model will allocate in a way that is more favourable to children in disadvantaged areas.<\/p><p> I reject the Senator's idea that I have an economic, narrow mindset coming to the education portfolio.  I carried this brief before when I wrote extensively on behalf of the party and predecessors of this committee on issues such as early school leaving, disadvantage and literacy.  I am attuned to needs in terms of mental resilience and the broader perspectives that people need from their education system.  I do not accept, however, that one cannot look to outcomes.  Regarding such issues as resilience, one would want to see schools participating in programmes, be they voluntary or within the curriculum, and signing up to the delivery of professional teacher improvements that can allow these programmes to be delivered successfully.  One would want to find in surveys students seeing the value of the impact of the programmes in which they are participating.  To talk about the importance of outcomes is not to belittle the goals that we set.  One can have broad goals and still want to see that they are being delivered effectively.  I take the Chairman's point that it is sometimes difficult to identify the outcomes.  There is a danger that only what is measured is delivered.  We are conscious of this and have at several points in the action plan for education identified the need to evolve better ways of evaluating the impact of programmes.  Impacts still matter.  As was rightly stated, if we are concerned about how children fare, we must focus on impacts, outcomes and pathways and not just on inputs, ratios and so on.  What I hope I bring to the table is a long career in evidence-based policy making.  I look for the evidence, the impact, the reviews and the expectations of robust evaluations being built into programmes.  Everyone with whom I deal expects this and most have signed up to this sort of approach to any policy that I ask the Oireachtas on behalf of the taxpayers to fund.<\/p><p> I accept the Senator's point that there is considerable pressure on principals and teachers.  One of the major themes of the action plan for education is how to help schools to improve their capacities.  There will be a major focus on strengthening the leadership of schools and examining the quality of continuous professional development, the capacity for peer review and mainstreaming successful initiatives and the provision of a space where more innovation can happen in schools.  I am keen to ensure that we do this.  A school that has ambitions must sometimes be able to draw on external resources to realise them.  As we develop national schemes, we must make them accessible and meaningful to the leaders in schools who are trying to make changes.<\/p><p> I am surprised by the Senator's assertion that only 2% to 3% of teachers have competence in Irish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#K00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1950,"content":"<p>To clarify, I was referring to staff outside teaching staff.

We are also developing a policy for teaching Irish in the Gaeltacht, where a separate set of issues is emerging.<\/p><p>Sometimes the quality of the language levels within the Gaeltacht are under some pressure.<\/p><p> I take the point about the Gaelscoileanna in the competitions for selection in those areas.  We must take a fresh look at how the competitions are put in place.  We also hope some of the transfers of patronage will go to Gaelscoileanna to reflect the need.  This matter is receiving attention.  We are examining the issue of patronage and trying to improve choice for parents.  It is a very important theme on which we will have to work attentively, but it is not easy.<\/p><p> The Chairman referred to the third level sector competing with other parts of the education system.  It is not accurate to say that.  We are making a strong case - I have always made the case - that we must see third level education as a big part of our ambitions.  It is important to refer to its economic impact to win the argument, but that is not to suggest it is solely an economic impact.  There is also an obligation on us as a committee to try to devise a longer term funding path for the sector.  I dealt with the point made about outcomes being hard to measure.  I agree, but we should try to find ways to at least be able to evaluate the impact of initiatives we are taking and that are, I hope, having a good result.<\/p><p> I will not get into the issue we discussed.  We have had useful meetings on the issue of the emergence of second level schools, how the demographic model works in the Department and which schools are counted and which are not.  Perhaps I might take up the Chairman's offer to discuss it with officials.  Obviously, we wish to accommodate to the best extent possible, but we must use a model that is fair to all and applied everywhere.<\/p><p> I was also asked, in respect of SNAs, if there could be better liaison with the HSE and its developmental tests.  An element of the new model is that this become a bigger part of it.  I hope, with the roll-out of the preschool model for children with special needs - I believe it is called AIM, access and inclusion model - there will be a better handle on the junior infant input.  <\/p><p> On how SNAs are allocated, there is a matrix which I believe dates back to the 1990s by which SNAs are allocated according to different needs.  It can be made available to the Chairman.  There is also a detailed explanation of the SNA allocation in special schools and how SNAs are allocated in respect of special classes.  The number of special classes has exploded in recent years and there is a SNA allocation.  Then there is the SNA allocation to pupils within mainstream classes.  Perhaps I might send the committee a note on the matter, rather than go through it now.  There is a model in place, but behind it there is also an older evaluation with a matrix setting out a rough evaluation of need relative to diagnostic categories.  That is available, too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#L00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1953,"content":"<p>We had agreed that we would discuss a number of subheads consecutively, but I will take them together and members can indicate if they have questions.

Guidance counselling was mentioned.  I am a little disappointed by the Minister's statement that the decision on ex quota teachers has still to be made.  He will recall not only from my meetings with him on the issue but also from the confidence and supply agreement Fianna F&aacute;il has with the Government that the restoration of guidance counselling is a key priority, with everything else.  Certainly, it is a condition of the way the minority Government operates.  Fianna F&aacute;il must see significant progress towards that commitment which was explicitly stated by the Minister being made.<\/p> <p>  The same applies to postgraduate grants.  There is a reference in the note to the fact that the financial cost of will be &euro;17 million next year and &euro;53 million in a full year.  Again, there is mention of the fact that a sum of &euro;5 million would get us off to a start, but we do not expect everything we seek to be achieved in the first budget.  We know that cannot happen, but there must be substantial and visible progress.  However, I do not see how a sum of &euro;5 million would make that work.  It is very low, unless the Minister can say it is &euro;5 million in 2017 only.  I visited Alltech Bioscience Centre in my constituency.  It is a very progressive company in which practically everybody working in science has a postgraduate degree or studying for one.  Companies such as Alltech Bioscience Centre fund some of their staff, but we cannot depend on the private sector alone to fund postgraduate students.  Everybody must have the opportunity to undertake postgraduate studies, not only for his or her and society's benefit but also to attract investment to the country to create jobs, which is so important.<\/p> <p>  Third level funding is absolutely critical.  We will discuss the Cassells report in the next few months.  I spoke yesterday to somebody who was a member of the expert group and vociferously opposed to the provision of student loans and had campaigned against them publicly.  There are, therefore, various views, even in the group.  There also will be various views here on the issue.  However, everybody, even Peter Cassells, would say that even if one wanted to provide student loans - not everybody does - the measure could not be implemented this year, next year or the year after.  There is, therefore, an immediate funding need for those years and so forth.  It has been outlined for over 15 years.  There must be an injection of &euro;100 million this year into the system to pay for teachers.  The Minister has clarified that even if it were granted, it would not go towards the cost of meeting the Lansdowne Road agreement commitments.  Perhaps he might confirm that if there were extra funding for the university system, the Lansdowne Road agreement commitments are already covered.  This is important.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned something to the Taoiseach yesterday and he was not surprised.  Perhaps he should not be surprised, but we wish to see action.  A college professor contacted me this week.  He has 470 students in a room that accommodates 450.  That is commonplace, but it is not sustainable.  Our university rankings have gone down mainly because of the funding crisis.  That leads to reputational issues which bring us back down the ranks again.  It is a vicious circle, but if we managed to increase funding, we could turn it in to a virtuous circle.  Our universities could look to Asia to try to attract students who pay substantial fees that help to fund the system.  They will not be interested in our universities when their rankings are going down.  Regardless of whether we like the rankings - they are not a perfect measure - many students, the consumers of education, take account of them.  It is essential that the Minister get the ball rolling by having the money injected into the system in order other money will follow, particularly from abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#M00300","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1955,"content":"<p>I have a quick question on capital.

Is there a budget to complete the other 36?  There are many references to significant pressure on the capital budget, but in the programme for Government there is an intention to introduce physical education, PE, to the leaving certificate programme.  Will there be a budget provision to review second level schools?  I am aware of a school in my constituency that opened in 1980 but which still does not have a PE hall.

Deputy Thomas Byrne alluded to this.  Students must sit on steps in lecture halls, etc.  I was told yesterday that there are ten administration jobs to go in GMIT, Castlebar, for example, and that there are staff there who believe the campus is in jeopardy.  These are immediate issues.  We cannot wait couple of years to address them.

Does the Minister have figures on any rural schools that do not have physical education rooms or multifunctional rooms?  There is a legacy in this regard affecting very many small rural schools.

As part of transition year work, for example, students may be assisting in a local voluntary organisation.  After the age of 16, they must wait for Garda clearance.  Apparently, there is a huge backlog.  Clearance can take a number of months while the students are in the middle-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#N00400","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1960,"content":"<p>To be fair, that is not really relevant to the Estimates.

There really is a need for investment in developing the skills of teachers in this area.<\/p> <p>  The preschool sector must now deal with four different departments, namely, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills, Tusla and Pobal.

However, it is not a question of doing so in year one.  That said, I take the Deputy's point.  We are committed to restoring guidance counselling.  We are obviously committed to making changes in certain areas - such as the postgraduate area - across the range of agreements.<\/p> <p>  Having listened to all the contributors, I believe the difficulty is that we nearly spent the full &euro;600 million on education.  That is a problem that we have to factor in.  Higher education is obviously on the minds of people, as are SNAs and special needs.  Both programmes in this regard cost &euro;1.5 billion.  The need to increase the numbers is obvious but, looking just at 2017, the share we may get from the allocation of &euro;600 million will not resolve these issues in the long term.  It can and will result in important work, I hope, but there is a wider issue as to how we approach the findings of the Cassells report.  I obviously accept Deputy Thomas Byrne's point that there are different views on the report.  It takes a number of years to roll out a student loan programme.  Therefore, having such a programme does not obviate the need to do things in the short term.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that a long-term direction in terms of a funding model would provide confidence around revenue, investment strategies and capacity.  As members will be aware, capital investment by the State can in some cases be only a small part of the total capital spend in the higher education area because of its capacity to raise funds and use income flows on which it can depend to ramp up and leverage investment.  A framework is important.  This is not all about what are we going to do in 2017 to address the crisis in this area.  We do need a framework because these institutions plan over a longer period and can leverage other funds if we move in that direction.  My goal would be to provide some medium-term certainty in this area.  The committee will have a big role to play in that regard.<\/p><p> In regard to Deputy Catherine Martin's question about completions, 16 new schools and 12 large-scale extensions have been completed, which brings the total number of completions to 28.  There is an expectation that up to 50 projects will be completed.  The Deputy is correct that funding of physical education, PE, halls has been extremely constrained because of the pressure of population growth and that this has restricted the capacity of the available capital to go into other areas.  The roll-out of PE to the leaving certificate will take some time to implement.  I take the Deputy's point, which brings us back to deciding the priorities of the capital spend.  Accommodating pupils' need has had to be the priority.  The early payment reflects issues such as immediate needs in terms of repairs, maintenance and so on.  There is no doubt but that capital budgets in the third level area are inadequate.  In the context of the mid-term review, which is coming up next year, we will be making a strong case for attention in this area.  It is not true that there is no budget for junior cycle reform.  Some &euro;17 million has been allocated to such reform this year, an increase of &euro;8 million on the previous year.  This allocation is not specific to one subhead but is distributed across a number of areas, such as continuous professional development and so on.  <\/p><p> I agree with Senator Ruane that access to third level for the disadvantaged is important.  My Department recently issued a call inviting participation.  It is not true to say that there is no funding for this.  The block grant allocation is designed to reward colleges that bring forward access.  In other words, built into the third-level block grant allocation is an expectation that the colleges will use the weighting they get to develop programmes that can realise such access.  The Department does not design all of the access programmes and tell the colleges to roll them out.  The colleges are independent institutions.  They develop programmes but in the block grant allocations they are given weightings for certain achievements.  I agree with the Senator that we need to sharpen those weightings.  We also need to see more opportunities for competitive expectation from the colleges to step up and be innovative and maybe find ways of sharing cost or rewarding results in that area.  As the Senator will probably know the Higher Education Authority is reviewing the current model.  It is a highly complex which I do not always understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#N00800","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1965,"content":"<p>On the Minister's point regarding the need to sharpen the weighting for funding in terms of access and so on, I believe we first need to overhaul access from second level to third level in terms of how the Department divides up the colleges versus the schools.  Currently, the colleges have no say in this regard, as the links were set years ago by the Department and have never been reviewed.  For example, the link college for Killinarden Community School is UCD.  For a child who comes from an educationally disadvantaged background in Tallaght, UCD is very far away.  There is a need for a review of the linkage between schools and colleges with a view to changing them up a little.  The two best performing schools in Tallaght are linked with the Trinity access programme, TAP.  This means that we are missing the boat in terms of access by most of the disadvantaged schools within disadvantaged areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016092900002#O00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1966,"content":"<p>That is a fair point.

The programme in that regard is still under consideration.  It is a case of prioritising programmes that can be implemented.  I take the Senator's point about the need for more training in special education at primary level.  There is huge emphasis on continuous professional development, including in the area of special needs education.  I am sorry I do not have the statistics in that regard available to me just now.  We are developing the inclusion support service within the NCSE.  This will be a centre of excellence to support schools in respect of special educational need and will improve access.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the preschool area, it is unfair to describe this as a crisis area.  It is an area identified as being hugely under-provided for.  Implementation of the second year extension is proving challenging.  Our piece is around inspection of the Aistear curriculum.  Inspections are focused on the educational element of that curriculum, which I think has been welcomed.  As I understand it, a couple of hundred evaluations have been done already, with more to be done.  We are doing our piece.  This is an area in which we need to increase provision, improve standards, extend access to continued professional training and reward those in the sector with the type of higher skills that are important to its development.  For example, the access and inclusion model, AIM, provides for a top-up payment to a school that has a co-ordinator with experience and training in special education co-ordination.  AIM also allows schools to access equipment grants or adaptation grants to equip preschools to accommodate children with special needs.  We are developing a programme through which the system is developing in parts.  There are a number of bodies involved that are working closely on the issue.  I understand there is a pretty good working relationship between those involved.  We know what we are doing and we are respected for the skill of our inspectors.  There is no point taking the inspectors out of an education and supervision model and putting them into something else when they have developed a good curriculum and are implementing it.  I take the Senator's point that this is an area we need to keep a very close eye on to ensure we are getting quality.  It is an area that is evolving.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about successes and failures.  There have, in my view, been many successes, including the action plan for education.<\/p><p>A huge effort was made in my Department to bring the action plan for education together.  We have multiple strategies but to bring them into one concerted programme that pulls them together, to corral our actions for 2016, 2017 and 2018, and allow a committee like this one to have a better view of what it is we are doing on all these fronts, is really important.  That was done within the targeted time, albeit we had to wait for a Government to meet to get it out there.  The plan is in draft form and we look forward to the committee's input, if changes are to be made.  <\/p><p> The appointment of SNAs was an important milestone in the course of the last period.  We had the introduction of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, our discussions in the D&aacute;il on the future of how admissions should evolve, Deputy Jim Daly's Bill and the Labour Party's Bill.  That all shows a minority Government does not necessarily mean one cannot implement change.  In fact, at times it can accelerate the pace of change if there is a degree of consensus at political level.  In some ways there has been a shift in influence from stakeholders within education to political stakeholders now.  I hope that is a good thing to see emerge and that we can make decisions around important issues for the future of education.  I do not know of any failures but I am sure some member of the committee will point them out to me.  <\/p><p> Perhaps we take for granted the successes that happen every year.  I mean the completion of the leaving certificate and the junior certificate that is run without significant incidents even though 60,000 pupils sit papers each year.  Everyone perceives it as a fair, objective and well-delivered outcome, and it is done year in and year out.  A lot of what works well in my Department has taken a lot of work to make sure it happens.  Perhaps we are used to this situation.  Perhaps we do not take the opportunity to step back and say how valuable the work is.

To assist the joint committee, we have provided a brief explanation note setting out the spend areas on the OPW Vote, expenditure per subhead to 30 June last, output information for each spending area and the emerging estimate requirements for 2017.<\/p> <p>  In 2015, the Office of Public Works participated in an Oireachtas pilot scheme to review performance information.  The chairman appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and committed her office to reviewing and improving the ways in which performance information is presented.<\/p><p>As part of the 2016 Estimates, the OPW revised a number of its performance measures and removed a number of measures which the Oireachtas deemed unsuitable.   As part of the 2017 Estimates process, my officials are currently considering a number of further changes to be published in the 2017 Revised Estimates volume.  The OPW is focusing on revised indicators that will attempt to demonstrate the quality, quantity, timeliness and cost of outputs at a strategic level.  It is important to acknowledge some indicators will represent events and milestones rather than final completions where programmes are to be delivered on a multi-annual basis.  Ultimately, the development of sustainable performance targets to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation will need to be integrated within the current enterprise systems in the office and in the development of the new financial management system.<\/p><p> Before I deal with the two areas of the OPW Vote, I will comment on expenditure to date this year.  Expenditure to the end of August 2016 was &euro;211 million from a total allocation of &euro;392 million.  This expenditure represents 59% of the gross current allocation and 56% of the capital allocation to date, which is in line with the overall profiled expenditure.  While there is some slight variance from profiled spend on an individual subhead basis, the two main programmes - flood risk management and estate portfolio management - are projecting to be on target by year end.  However, in order to facilitate a number of property acquisitions in 2016, it will be necessary to reallocate certain funds or vire within the estate portfolio management programme.  Capital expenditure on flood risk management is currently at &euro;19 million but an increase in the rate of expenditure is profiled for the remainder of 2016 on a number of major schemes.  In the event of any difficulties in achieving this level of expenditure, a deferred surrender or capital carryover facility will ensure the intended investment in flood risk management is still available in 2017.<\/p><p> My officials are currently engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on funding requirements for next year to ensure sufficient resources are provided in order to deliver the core activities of the office.  The level of service to be provided by the OPW in future years is expanding both in the delivery of the Government-approved flood risk management plan and in the management of the State property portfolio.  I am committed to ensuring resources are available to deliver these significant programmes of work.  This Government has demonstrated its support of flood relief by extending its commitment to provide &euro;430 million to flood risk management within the 2016-2021 capital investment plan, increasing the allocation over that period from &euro;45 million to &euro;100 million per annum. <\/p><p> In the estate portfolio area, with rents rising and demands for suitable accommodation increasing, the OPW will continue to meet space requirements through office rationalisation and the greater use of open plan solutions.  Additional space demands can, in some cases, only be delivered through new leases of modern offices and through the purchase or construction of alternative accommodation.  The OPW is seeking funds in 2017 to enter into a number of new leases in Dublin, the cost of which, over time, will be offset by a number of lease surrenders.<\/p><p> A substantive body of works over the next five years is also commencing with the introduction of a property retrofit programme to allow for the refit of the existing portfolio of Government accommodation.  This will maintain the building fabric and optimise the capacity of office accommodation within State-owned properties.  The EU requirements to minimise carbon emissions and the carbon footprint for public buildings will present challenges for both the OPW and the occupying Departments in the coming years.<\/p><p> In delivering heritage services, the OPW continues to co-operate with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to realise the tourism potential within many of these historic visitor sites.  Building on the success of the Wild Atlantic Way, the OPW has partnered with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and F&aacute;ilte Ireland in order to introduce and promote Ireland's Ancient East.  This partnership aims to improve the visitor experience at a broad range of locations through investment in capital works projects over the period from 2016 to 2021. <\/p><p> In respect of flood risk management for 2016, the delivery of complex engineering projects continues to present many challenges through the planning stage, procurement process and the construction phase.  I have requested my officials to examine the long lead-in times linked to these projects with a view to identifying methods of expediting their delivery.  The key objective of this programme is to reduce the risk of river and coastal flooding to homes and businesses and to provide appropriate flood risk information for planning in Ireland.  As part of that, the OPW is charged with consideration of climate change and ensuring that appropriate plans to mitigate flood risk are put in place.  In terms of output measures, it is worth noting that the cumulative number of properties to benefit from major flood relief works to date is 7,000 with an additional 5,000 properties benefitting from local authority projects funded by the OPW.  The cumulative value of this benefit to properties, or loss avoided in economic terms, is estimated at &euro;1.2 billion.  <\/p><p> As part of the capital works programme, I am pleased to report that contracts are now placed at Bandon and Skibbereen and construction is now proceeding.  A total of ten major capital flood defence schemes are currently under construction, another is due to commence this year and a further 21 schemes are at planning and design stage.  These projects will provide protection to a further 4,500 properties at risk of flooding.  In tandem with this, &euro;3 million has been approved by the OPW under the minor works scheme in 2016 for 58 additional localised flood relief projects to be undertaken directly by the local authorities. <\/p><p> The OPW continues to maintain all arterial drainage schemes completed under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  This investment provides ongoing protection to 650,000 acres of agricultural land, infrastructure and properties through the maintenance of 11,500 km of river channel including 800 km of embankments at an annual cost of &euro;15 million.  Separately, local authorities maintain 4,600 km of river channel providing further localised flood protection.<\/p><p> The OPW's catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme is the largest flood risk management planning programme ever undertaken.  It has completed detailed surveys and models across 300 at-risk areas involving 6,700 km of watercourse and 9,400 km2 of flood plain.  The output from the ongoing CFRAM programme is a comprehensive suite of maps for 300 communities around the country covering 90 coastal areas and in the region of 7,000 km of river.  Members will be aware that local communities are currently being consulted in respect of these maps.  Once the public consultation is complete and all information considered, the final plans will be submitted for approval to the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform and may then be adopted by the local authorities.  <\/p><p> The inter-departmental flood policy co-ordination group is developing a range of policy initiatives to underpin the overall investment in managing national flood risk.  It is also considering a number of other prevention and mitigation measures for providing flood relief which may include schemes for individual property protection and voluntary home and farmyard relocation.<\/p><p> I understand that the members of this committee are particularly interested in ensuring that home owners and business owners can insure their properties against flood damage.  As members are aware, there are a range of cross-departmental considerations in this area including the Minister of Finance who has responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  A memorandum of understanding now exists between Insurance Ireland and the OPW with the common objective of ensuring that appropriate information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers.  I have asked the committee to expand the memorandum to incorporate the role of the Department to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  I am pleased to report that I have reached an agreement with the industry for quarterly meetings of the working group to make progress on any issues that may arise.<\/p><p> The other main programme of investment for my office is estate portfolio management which encompasses the management, maintenance and development of the State's property portfolio.  In recent years, with a move towards better space management, the Office of Public Works has rationalised the State's office accommodation, surrendering more than 300 leases, with cumulative savings of over &euro;130 million being generated in recent years.  The OPW now also provides a shared service for the maintenance of accommodation occupied by Departments and manages construction projects on their behalf.<\/p><p> In the heritage area I am pleased to report that the total number of recorded visitors to OPW sites to the end of August was over 3 million, pointing to a record number of visitors in 2016.  This is a key driver of the economic benefit being generated for the tourism sector.  The OPW&rsquo;s heritage service has had considerable success in identifying additional sources of sustainable income through investment measures undertaken in recent years.  For the first time heritage receipts will exceed &euro;10 million in 2016, an increase of 42% on the &euro;6.9 million received in 2012 when investment to increase visitor numbers was initiated.<\/p><p> Guided visitor services will continue to be provided by the OPW at 70 sites nationwide, on either a seasonal or a full-time basis.  They include nationally and internationally known attractions such as Newgrange, Clonmacnoise, Glendalough and Kilmainham Gaol where recent investment has received many plaudits.  Many of the OPW's heritage sites have been utilised extensively as part of this year&rsquo;s commemorations and I acknowledge the work undertaken by staff of OPW in this area.<\/p><p> I realise I have referenced only a small part of the work of the OPW which has a vast array of responsibilities, but if committee members have questions about its  funding or outputs, I will be happy to accept and discuss them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016092900002#F00500","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":1997,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for coming before the joint committee.

Coming from east Galway and, with the Minister of State, representing the people of south Galway while living on the banks of the Shannon, I know how Storm Desmond on 9 December 2015 left a hand of destruction not for the first, but rather a second time in five years, in the area.  I welcome all that is before me today and I have a number of questions.<\/p> <p>  I have engaged about the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study, CFRAMS, since its inception and I compliment all the engineering staff who attended the 29 various sites along the Shannon.  At the beginning, with the buy-in factor, it seemed like a very drawn-out process but coming to the end, I compliment what we have seen in Ballinasloe, Portumna and, on the coastal side, in Oranmore.  What is cost of the reports from CFRAMS to date?  We have had three years of projects with three years of reports.  They are vital and there have been ancillary works in considering the impact on the environment, etc., but where are we on the costings?<\/p> <p>  There is the issue of choosing locations and venues for meetings.  Unfortunately, this year Gort was not a designated site because it is in the lowlands.  I understand all that.  There was slight confusion among the people of Gort and with me as in the previous two years, we held them in the community centre in Gort.  Why did we not go back to the epicentre of the destruction in south Galway?  When the CFRAMS concludes in its current format, when will we see the introduction of the projects and how will they be assessed for priority along the banks of the Shannon?  When we assessed the CFRAMS project, it was based on towns but why was Banagher left out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016092900002#J00900","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2014,"content":"<p>I fully appreciate where the Deputy is coming from as we are from the same constituency.  We have a good appreciation for what has happened in Galway, as well as other areas that saw flooding over the winter period?  She asked about the cost of CFRAMS.  The cost at this stage is estimated, at the time of completion, to be &euro;35 million for 300 projects brought through the process.  As it comes to the end of the process, we see the merit in it and what it will do.  One of the major elements is that it will take approximately 18 months from the duration of a seven-year process.  Any project coming from CFRAMS will hence be delivered more quickly.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of CFRAMS public consultations, the venues were organised by consultants.  My understanding is there was some confusion, particularly in Galway, as referred to by the Deputy, but the meeting was held in Oranmore this year and a number of consultations were also held in Oranmore.  The confusion arose because people believed CFRAMS was dealing with south Galway but it was not; south Galway is being dealt with by Galway County Council under a flood relief scheme that is outside of CFRAMS and should be moving ahead of it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the end of the CFRAMS process.  Public consultations are ongoing and the last of the 29 areas will be put on display next Friday.  It deals with the Suir.  When the public consultations are complete and amendments are made to reflect public consultations, the CFRAMS projects will be presented to the Department and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, for approval.  They will then go to the local authorities for adoption or whatever.  From then they will be a priority list of the 300 projects.  There will be a strategic plan to deal with them on a ten-year basis.  The projects that give the best cost benefit and see the highest risk will be dealt with.

I have had various discussions with the Minister of State and his officials.  The Minister of State has stated that the output from the ongoing CFRAM study is a comprehensive suite of maps for 300 communities.  That should be at least 302.  Two communities are not included: Castleconnell village and Montpelier alongside each other.  There is a stretch of water from Annacotty village as far as O'Brien's Bridge in Montpelier that has consistently flooded in 2009 and most recently in late 2015 and early 2016.<\/p> <p>  Public consultations took place in the Castle Oaks hotel on Thursday, 1 September.  More than 100 people from the area attended.  Lo and behold, we found no maps for Castleconnell village and Montpelier.  The CFRAM draft document states that no residential properties, business properties or utilities are at risk in Castleconnell village.  That makes no sense.  I have asked the OPW to go back to the drawing board and produce draft maps with planned flood relief measures for Castleconnell village and Montpelier.  I want an update on when that will happen.  That should be followed by public consultation with the local residents in the Castleconnell village and Montpelier area.  I ask the Minister of State for an update on that.  Given that homes and businesses in Castleconnell village and Montpelier had been exposed to flooding for at least a month in 2016 and the same in 2009, when the people turned up at that meeting they were shocked to find that effectively the OPW claimed it was not a problem in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016092900002#K01300","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2037,"content":"<p>When the public consultation process began, Senator Kieran O'Donnell rang me directly.

The CFRAM flood study maps for Castleconell were developed prior to the flooding of last winter, making use of the information available at that time including information on the 2009 event.  The maps were displayed locally during public consultation in 2014 and were subsequently formally consulted, under SI 122 of 2010 and SI 495 of 2015, in November-December 2015.  The feedback received generally at that time indicated that the maps, which show properties at potential risk in Castleconnell during very extreme events, represented past flooding events reasonably well.  However, 2015 changed the view on that.  The OPW recognises that there have now been two particularly extreme floods on the Shannon in recent years, which may indicate a possible underestimation of the likelihood of such severe events showing on the existing CRFAM flood maps for Castleconell.  While some flood event data collection was undertaken after the winter of 2015, it takes some time to collate all the detailed information necessary to review the technical analysis and the maps have not yet been fully reviewed on the basis of the flood event.<\/p> <p>  The OPW fully acknowledges and agrees that future analysis must be undertaken on foot of the flooding of last winter in order to better understand the specifics of the flood event and to review the hydraulic modelling and flood mapping of this area.  Information received at the public consultation held in September this year in respect of the extensive flooding that occurred will help to inform this review.<\/p> <p>  I can give Senator Kieran O'Donnell my note.  Basically, I am saying that is the reason for it.  I commend the Senator on the approach he took on the issue in that he highlighted it to us in a constructive way.

To date, there was one allocation for Castleconnell and Montpelier of &euro;54,000 and another &euro;63,000 was allocated.  There is some of that funding still to be drawn down.

A consultation took place on Thursday, 13 September in City Hall.  Many people from areas of the city that were exposed to flooding were present.  I refer to King's Island, St. Mary's Park, the Corbally area, the Mill Road, Richmond Park, Athlunkard Street and Sir Harry's Mall.  I want an update on these proposals, particularly with regard to St. Mary's Park.  Clearly, people are exposed in those areas.  When would the Minister of State expect these measures to be put in place?  Perhaps he could provide an overarching report on how the local authorities can draw down funding for the minor works schemes and other areas.  The main point here is it is extremely important that Limerick city and county, including east Limerick, be included in the CFRAM study.  More particularly, the Minister of State might comment on the matter of when the funding will be available and when these works can be carried out.  I thank him for his attention in respect of this issue and for seeing to it that work on the plans for the areas to which I refer will be expedited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016092900002#L01200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2049,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I had the privilege of travelling to Limerick during the summer for the signing of the contract relating to Foynes, which is a &euro;2.8 million project.  The works have commenced there.  The project is a defence against coastal flooding, which is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  In Limerick city, funding of &euro;1.3 million for advance work at Verdant Place, King's Island, which was originally part of an application for minor works, has been approved by the OPW.  Planning permission has been received by the local authority and works, which consist of repointing the stone wall and the construction of reinforced concrete walls at the rear of it, are expected to commence in mid-October, with a view to completion in the first quarter of 2017.  A further &euro;90,000 in funding has been granted to Limerick local authority for small works on Condell Road, subject to design and implementation being undertaken in such a way as to minimise the risk of these works to be redone when the full scheme is put in place.  From that, Senator O'Donnell can see that we are working with the local authority on advance works.<\/p> <p>  It is important to say that the minor works funding application process is something of which local authorities are making use.  I have written to all of the authorities in recent weeks to encourage them to apply for funding.  It is not often a Department states that it has the funding and asks local authorities to come and apply for it.  It is important to reiterate that there are minor works which can be done.<\/p><p>I think we have spent &euro;37 million so far on minor works throughout the country and - this is in my report - given protection to 5,000 properties to date.  The latter is a substantial level of protection to provide.  It is not to be underestimated and we should make more use of it.  Last Sunday, I met one of the chief executives of a local authority who asked me to keep the money coming and said the local authority could do with it.  I asked him in turn to keep the applications coming and said we could give the local authority the money, provided it meets the criteria, which it does in many cases.  I acknowledge the work of the local authorities.  So far this year, 58 projects have been approved under the minor works scheme.  We will continue our efforts in that regard and we must work in partnership with the local authorities.  I do not agree with the idea that the OPW will do everything on its own and the local authority will do everything on its own.  We must work together and find the solutions.  I am glad to say that, from my experience in the months I have been responsible for the Office of Public Works, there is a very good working relationship between it and the local authorities.  They need to ensure that this continue and that we work together for the benefit of flood relief and people's peace of mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016092900002#L01300","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2051,"content":"<p>I notice that everybody is going over time.

There is no agreement within this memorandum of understanding that while works are to be carried out, they will continue to insure.  There is no such provision.

The length of time it takes to bring a project from inception, as I call it, to construction stage, to the point at which the machines come on the site, is one of the issues I considered when I came into the Department.  The average time has been seven years.  We are working on a protocol whereby we would reduce that by at least three and a half years.  Legislation will go through the D&aacute;il seeking to expedite that process with regard to environmental impact statements and the lifting of some thresholds.  That is now on the agenda and will be brought in as part of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016.  We are doing everything I can see we need to do.  I came into the Department and looked with a fresh pair of eyes at this and said the delay was not right, considering the experiences we have.  I have a good understanding of insurance and how it works.  We need to get things done more quickly.  I think it is very worrying for people.  At present, all I can offer is to try to reduce the period it takes to complete projects and get properties back into an insurable state.  There are cases as well, though - Senator Conway-Walsh may have some evidence of it - where people are being refused insurance on the basis of the CFRAM maps, which should not be used for commercial purposes.

At this stage, local authorities have the expertise to do a good deal of work, especially in flood risk areas.  There are working under pressure.  Whether they have enough resources is an issue for the chief executives.  They need to come forward if they not have enough people.  Anyway, I hope they have enough and, if they do not, I hope they bring it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016092900002#N00500","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2070,"content":"<p>I do not think they do, to be honest.

The CFRAM programme is an excellent undertaking on the part of the OPW.  It is thorough and scientific, and we see what the OPW can do, in conjunction with consultants, in respect of some of the major flood defences that have been built.  They have worked.  The problem is that they take time, as the Minister of State has highlighted, and unfortunately flooding is recurring.<\/p><p>I understand that Crossmolina has already been touched upon, but literally three weeks ago we nearly had the very same premises flooded again.  The media gets very taken by the fact that there has been building on flood plains, which of course we consider daft, but for the most part, the places in Mayo that are being flooded are long-standing towns such as Crossmolina and parts of Ballina, where I am from.  Moreover, they are the older parts of town and we can definitely see the results of climate change there.  Sometimes the building on flood plains argument is thrown in as a red herring to distract from spending and who should foot the bill.  People have traded and lived in these homes for years and it is only now that this regular flooding and the threat of flooding are happening.<\/p><p> The Minister of State has highlighted the importance of local authorities making applications under the minor works scheme.  While some local authorities have been a bit backward in doing this, it is very important.  I would like the Minister of State to consider Crossmolina, as people there really are very fearful as this winter approaches.  I thank the Minister of State for responding to my invitation and that of the people when he visited the area during the summer.  It is an issue on which he has taken a very proactive approach and he has responded with great integrity to the concerns of people.  However, I am not too happy with how the Office of Public Works, OPW, has performed in that area.  During the previous December I had his predecessor as Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, down to visit and the pilot project for the floodgates - to which the Minister of State has just referred - was launched.  Between that time and the current Minister of State's arrival on the scene, no criteria had been developed with regard to the rolling out of that project.  I believe doing so was the responsibility of the OPW.  As for the flood wall, we only found out shortly before his latest visit - courtesy of the Minister of State - that funding had been allocated to the local authority to build a flood wall as a minor flood relief scheme.  There had been no word of it but in every single month since the then Minister of State, Deputy Harris visited, there had been monthly meetings between the OPW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the county council and locals.<\/p><p> There is also an issue with the clearing out, which has been touched on by Senator Burke, and on the issue of who is or is not responsible.  In my experience it has not just been since last December in case this sounds overly harsh or critical with regard to the OPW.  The clearing and cleaning of the river needs to be addressed.  I am not talking about interfering with the river bed.  I have sent photographs to the Minister of State which show an entire encroachment into the river of vegetation coming from the river bank.  This is not just trees overhanging which can be clipped but proper clearing that should be done, not even by going into the river but by a machine on the river bank.  This is not being done.  The OPW is very much operating within statute with regard to its obligations and from a statutory point of view, under section 37 of the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, the OPW is required to carry out maintenance of a river and its tributaries where it has carried out a drainage scheme.  My information, on which I have never been contradicted and which many officials will state off the record, is that no clearing or cleaning has ever been carried out of the River Deel, which flows through Crossmolina, in the section of the river for which the OPW is responsible.  It is belatedly going in there now after there was nearly a flood three weeks ago.  I was there twice last November and December and it is absolutely horrible.  I refer to everyone here who is aware of people and businesses that have experienced flooding and the thought that we are not taking every step that can be taken.  I reiterate the Minister of State has moved things on but I am sorry to say things should have been moving before this.  Whether it is Crossmolina or the River Moy in Ballina, no clearing by the OPW is going on.  Why is it suddenly now going in and doing some clearing it should have been doing for years?  This is an old chestnut and I do not believe the OPW is complying with its statutory obligations.  I believe it is only interested in the longer-term solution and not so much in the shorter-term solutions.  The response of the OPW to the issue of clearing the river is that it will not have that much of an impact.  A flood took place in November when two to three inches went in.  If those two to three inches could have been pulled back it might have saved some premises at that time.  The Minister of State and I have had this discussion.  I feel that a real spotlight needs to go on how the OPW has conducted itself in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016092900002#O01500","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2093,"content":"<p>If I could intervene here Senator to allow the Minister of State to respond to some of the Senator's questions.

On the River Deel, the OPW was batting it over to the National Parks and Wildlife Service on the shellfish issue regarding pearl mussel, as well as to Inland Fisheries Ireland, and there was no problem with those agencies whatsoever, which the Minister of State established at that meeting.  Again, if I am sound in heart, it is only a small tip of the iceberg as to how fearful people are in Crossmolina.  To tell the truth, I am getting fed up of going back again and again and I cannot understand for the life of me why the OPW could not have done some clearing on that river before now.  I sincerely hope that come this winter, nothing like the previous flooding will come to pass.

Practically all the focus has been upon rivers, towns and villages, which I can understand as that is where settlements are.  However there is a more individual area that is being ignored, namely, the coastal areas.  I shall cite an example.  The Minister spoke about the minor works for the local authorities, which is good.  An issue arises when there are individuals who are being completely ignored and are being affected by legislation, including EU legislation.<\/p><p>When the Department, the OPW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and the local authorities are involved, an unfortunate individual can become bogged and weighed down by rules, regulations, legislation and the like.  I want to give the Minister of State a good example.  There is an area in north Wexford that is in a special area of conservation, SAC.  The access point to a person's home has been washed into the sea and there is now a ten-foot drop where it was.  A number of years ago I organised for officials of the NPWS and the local authority to visit, but I am not sure if somebody from the OPW came.  All sorts of thing were to be done.  However, when everything was all looked at and analysed, what was required to be done would not be legal because the area was in a SAC, according to the assessment made by the powers that be.

However, people's houses will be washed into the sea and for them to defend their properties, they will have to break the law.

However, people living along the coast must be given the opportunity to at least protect their property.  That is all I am asking, but to protect their property, it will have an impact on an SAC.

Obviously, we are hearing a lot more about one in 100 year events that now seem to be happening three or four times in a period of ten years.  Are there revised figures as clearly they are no longer one in 100 year events?  They are happening with greater frequency.  I remember a very serious event in my area in 2007 in Leopardstown in the middle of the summer.  Subsequently &euro;3 million was allocated for the Carysfort and Maretimo stream scheme.  In 2011, on the night of the presidential debate, a poor unfortunate garda died in the river.  Dundrum Town Centre, the single biggest ratepayer in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area, was flooded, while there was no Luas service for two days owing to flooding.  Flooding is terrible, no matter where and when it happens, but when it happens in urban areas, it tends to be much more costly to deal with it as there is much more infrastructure.  Is there a proper programme to clear gulleys and drainage systems all around Dublin and in urban areas generally?  While I know that it is a matter for the local authorities, when I am cycling, I can see that drains are blocked and have grass and weeds growing out of them.  There is an argument that I have heard made by engineers that the more drains are cleared, the faster water moves further downstream and floods the pumping station in D&uacute;n Laoghaire or somewhere else.  Presumably the idea  behind having drains is to drain water away.  If they are full of mud, silt and grass, they are not going to work.  Obviously, when there is heavy rainfall, as there was in 2011, it does not matter how clear a drain is as it will not cope with the volume of water entering it.  Is there a programme in place in urban areas across the country to keep storm drains clear?<\/p><p>We have all seen the photographs and the aerial footage of houses and cattle in south Galway looking like islands sounded by water.  If the same thing that happened in south Galway in 2015 was to happen again in 2016 - we hope it does not - is there a critical emergency plan in place to deal with the situation more efficiently?  Obviously, we should learn from the experience of last year.<\/p><p> The Minister referred to the Dodder CFRAMS, which was one of the earliest such studies.  He suggested that there is work to be done.  He might touch on what works are being done on the Dodder and on its tributary in Dundrum.<\/p><p> I would also like to ask about the voluntary relocation of farmyards, houses, sheds, etc.  Can the Minister of State indicate how many houses nationally, or in particular areas, have been looked at with a view to deciding on a cost-benefit basis that rather than protecting these houses against floods, it would be better to move the residents to another location?  I do not know whether the number in question is closer to five, 50, 500 or 5,000.<\/p><p> I think everybody here today has been asking for rivers to be cleared of vegetation.  It is perfectly logical for people to want improvements to be made in their own areas.  There is a view that this often pushes the problem on to the next village, where the flooding might be worse as the water gets faster.  I am not saying I share this view.  I think the Minister of State was right when he said the best approach is to start at the sea and work back up.  There is a body of opinion, particularly among environmentalists, that these rivers should not be drained but that they should be allowed to fill up with silt and vegetation in a natural way.  Many people say that rivers were cleared in the old days.  Is there a departmental view that river-clearing is good or not good?  It could be more nuanced than that.  Perhaps river-cleaning is appropriate in some locations but not in others.  I have heard people say that there is no way anything should be drained or dredged, that nature is nature and that people should not build near flood plains.  Senator Mulherin was right when she said that places which have never before flooded have started to flood.  If houses that have stood for 100 or 150 years without flooding are now starting to flood, it is clear that we have issues we did not have before now.<\/p><p> I would like to conclude by mentioning an issue that I intend to raise with the Minister of State later.  Ireland's performance results in the global green economy index have declined considerably since 2014.  We will not solve flooding automatically by making climate change-related improvements.  Nearly everybody accepts that there is a relationship between flooding and climate change, which is causing sea levels to rise and rain patterns to change.  We are seeing heavier rainfall at times of the year when we are not used to it.  The Government's climate change performance appears to be getting worse.  Does the Minister of State have any views on that?  What can we do to improve it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016092900002#Q02300","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2123,"content":"<p>I will respond firstly to what the Senator said about accessibility to our sites.

It is something we are striving towards.<\/p> <p>  Senator Horkan also spoke about the problems in Dundrum and the link with the Dodder, which is the subject of a major ongoing scheme.  I cannot give the Deputy specific details of the work that is being done on the ground now.  I know the works are ongoing.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about the cleaning of drains, which is a matter for each local authority.  I think channels, drains and gullies need to be kept clean when all surface water schemes are being done.  If large quantities of water are continuing to flow straight to outfalls that cannot take such quantities, attenuation ponds should be set up in intermediate locations to take water and release it on a gradual basis.

It is important that we ensure we have enough sandbags available, just as we make sure we have enough salt to deal with severe frost.  People need to know what the relevant phone numbers are and who they are supposed to telephone.  Having travelled to various counties, I want to record my appreciation of the huge effort that was made and the resilience that was shown by everybody involved in the local authorities, the OPW, the voluntary agencies and the local communities.

The implementation plan has been agreed and we are working to train people.  I hope we will be modelling some of the technologies by this time next year.  It usually takes approximately ten years for one of these systems to be completely validated.  Our plan is to have it up and running in five years.

There is a case for the flow of water.  We must get water from A to Z.  We start at the outfall, be it the sea, and we work our way back.  We must have flow and how we achieve that flow is by having clear channels.  At present in Claregalway we are deepening a channel at the bridge by 1.2 m to create more capacity to get water flowing towards the sea.  We are doing the work but we must abide by the rules and regulations.  There are certain times when one can do work and there are certain times one cannot do work and we must work with all the other bodies involved such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  A member suggested that we have a single authority to deal with this, but when one looks at planning for housing, one sees the same agencies involved.  We have a crisis with homelessness and we must try to deal with within the structures that exist.

It is important to state at the outset that if we spend public money we need to show that we are getting a benefit.  Where there is a major scheme, one cannot say that one will spend &euro;20 million to save a house.  We must ensure that we are getting the optimum benefit for the money we spend.  We must remember that it is taxpayer's money and public money that is being spent.  A cost benefit analysis must be done.  The cost benefit analysis must show that the project is yielding a benefit.  We had a discussion earlier on the benefit arising from the conference centre for which we pay a high rent.  There must be a benefit when we spend public money.  The cost benefit ratio for a major scheme is 1:1, the ratio for schemes in minor works is 1:1.5.  In fairness, what happens is that when the local authority is putting forward minor schemes it works closely with the Office of Public Works to find solutions which will be at a cost that will meet the benefit.  I do not think anybody is using the cost benefit analysis to stop projects happening.  Let me reassure people of that.<\/p> <p>  On the second issue, the relocating proposals I am bringing forward are being worked on at present.  We had a meeting of the interdepartmental group on Tuesday last and we will be meeting again in about two weeks time.

Let me put on record the Minister of State's response to me on the Arts for Peace project and I want to thank him for arranging that meeting between his officials and Arts for Peace.  I understand that will take place soon.  I sent some proposals in regard to mediation in respect of the project and I hope they will be considered.  I am not expecting the Minister of State to answer that now as this is a comment rather than a question.  I look forward to the Minister of State arranging that meeting as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  I tabled a recent parliamentary question on actions that were taken by employees of the OPW regarding bullying in the workplace.  To put it mildly, the reply I received was not acceptable.  The issue raised in the question must be addressed.  I wish to advise the Minister of State that those employees felt they needed to raise an issue, which they did, and it is not the only location at which there are issues in respect of bullying.  There are a number of areas in the OPW where cases have been raised and have proceeded to some form of arbitration and yet when I asked the question, I was given short shrift.  I do not accept that.  I ask that the officials review my parliamentary question and I hope the query raised will be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I now have a question on insurance, where a business has been affected by flooding and does not have insurance.  A number of businesses made claims under the Department scheme, but the level of compensation was very low.  Businesses have folded because of the flooding.  It will cost them substantially more than what is on offer from the OPW to get back into business.  In the particular case I am speaking about, one is looking at a cost of &euro;250,000 to get back into business.  What is on offer will not allow those concerned to do so.  Is any effort being made to look at these cases?  I would not imagine there is a significant number of such businesses throughout the country, but there are cases of a businesses beside a river which have been in operation for 100 years and are now affected and cannot now get insurance.<\/p><p>They cannot get back into business, cannot get insurance and had no cover for the last flood.

The problem, however, is that we have to quantify what we are looking at before deciding to spend money on it.  We cannot have an open cheque book.

When I appeared before the committee earlier in the year, I agreed to return for a discussion following the publication of the mid-year expenditure report.  Members will recall that my Department&rsquo;s group of Votes comprises a significant number of Votes, as follows:<\/p><blockquote>(i) The Vote for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Vote for the Office of Government Procurement and the Vote for the National Shared Services Office;<br \/><br \/>(ii) The Votes for a number of Offices under the aegis of my Department, including: &ndash; the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service and the Office of the Ombudsman; and<br \/><br \/>(iii) The Votes for Superannuation and Retired Allowances (which covers civil service pensions) and Secret Service.<\/blockquote> <p>The Vote for the remaining element of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, that is for the Office of Public Works was handled separately by the committee this morning.<\/p><p>The structure of the Vote for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform remains unchanged in 2016 from last year, with two strategic programmes focused on public expenditure and sectoral policy and public service management and reform.<\/p><p>The allocated resources for each programme, in terms of staffing and funding, are set out in Part 3 of the Estimate.  A total gross estimate of &euro;45.9 million is provided for 2016.  The statement I gave to the committee in June dealt in detail with the areas covered by these programmes.  I am not going to cover the same ground again, but I am willing to answer any questions which might arise on these matters today.<\/p><p>I would like to discuss some of the key strategic challenges currently faced by my Department and to listen to the views of members of the committee on these matters.  I will begin with public expenditure policy and make a few comments in the context of budget 2017.  I have already set out in some detail at the Select Committee on Budgetary Oversight the key points that are relevant for this committee.<\/p><p>The Government is very supportive and is engaging with the Oireachtas in respect of an enhanced input into discussions on budgetary priorities and it is for this reason that I published the mid-year expenditure report.  This follows on from the Summer Economic Statement, which sets out the Government&rsquo;s medium-term budgetary strategy.  The Summer Economic Statement envisages that day to day spending on public services will increase by &euro;1.3 billion to &euro;53.1 billion in 2017.<\/p><p>We also expect that capital investment will increase by &euro;400 million to give a total capital spending of &euro;4.4 billion.  This is to provide for continued investment in our schools, health care facilities and transport network.  It also allows us to invest more in housing to address the serious pressures that exist there.<\/p><p>The State now employs more than 66,000 teachers, 10,000 doctors and 41,000 nurses in our education and health sectors, all figures up on 2013.<\/p><p>This targeted investment in front-line staff has come hand-in-hand with real reform and a focus on excellence in public service delivery.  For example, linking the provision of additional funding in the health sector this year to an accountability framework for the acute hospital sector will help to ensure sustainability for our health system in future years.<\/p><p>The main aim for budget 2017 is to deliver sustainable public services that are fiscally prudent or affordable while looking to make improvements.  There are many competing demands for scarce resources but if the main challenges and priorities are to be addressed, it is not enough to look at the incremental increases to services.  We have to look at how we are effectively spending what is available to us at present.<\/p><p>I would like now to touch on the issue of public service pay.  Control of the public service pay bill is vital to the overall sustainability of the public finances.  This means responsibility on the two core drivers of the pay bill: the numbers of public servants employed and their rates of remuneration.  Thankfully, we are making progress in this area.<\/p><p>The Government has allocated funding for extra Garda, doctors, nurses, teachers and special needs assistants in order to support essential front-line services.  This increase in resources has been accomplished in tandem with real pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road agreement, LRA.  This agreement provides certainty and predictability to the management of the public service pay bill.  It allows for strong fiscal planning with resources ring-fenced for sustainable pay restoration, balancing the competing claims for additional Government expenditure within the resources available.  It provides a framework for negotiating on issues that matter to public servants &ndash; a good example of this is the recent agreement with the INTO and TUI on new entrant teacher pay.<\/p><p>A final development worth noting is the agreement in principle by the Government to establish an independent Public Service Pay Commission.  Its role will be to provide evidence-based analysis on pay matters to assist officials and the Government in discharging their negotiation function on behalf of Government.  The Commission will be advisory in nature and will report initially by the middle of next year.  A consultation is currently underway on the role and structure of this body and I intend to bring a memorandum to Government shortly.<\/p><p>Moving on to the broader reform, effective management and sustainable pay policy go hand-in-hand with meaningful reform of our public services.  The importance of efficiency cannot be overstated, it has significant consequences for finances and job creation.  Most important, the public service provides essential services for our people when they need them most.<\/p><p>We have made progress under the current public service reform plan to deliver better outcomes.  Service users, whether citizens or business customers, are being placed at the centre of service design and delivery.  We are working to achieve better outcomes for customers by prioritising the digitisation of services, as set out in the public service ICT strategy, to recognise how expectations for technology-enabled Government services have risen significantly in recent years.<\/p><p>Successful delivery of the ICT strategy will require a significant increase in the provision for the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, within my Department, to be offset by savings elsewhere across the system. <\/p><p>We will fund much of this programme by combining our buying power, sharing our assets across Government and driving out and reducing duplication.  This is a vital investment in modernisation, to reap substantial benefits across the system.  We aim to streamline processes and enable citizens to transact wholly online with Government and access Government services digitally.<\/p><p>Elsewhere, implementation of the actions under the Civil Service renewal plan to improve capacity and capability are continuing.  The plan is implementing important changes, strengthening governance, delivering and developing capacity and improving our approach to HR in the system. <\/p><p>However, while acknowledging we have made progress I firmly believe there is a need to build on this progress and maintain a strong focus on reform over the coming years.  That is why, in addition to completing the current phase of the reform plan, I have asked my Department to initiate the development of the next phase of public service reform to cover the period 2017-19.  I would be very pleased to hear the views of members on this next phase.<\/p><p>In parallel with this programme we continue to make progress in delivering more open, transparent and accountable Government with a number of significant changes, in areas including freedom of information, protected disclosures, regulation of lobbying and appointments to State boards.  I am always mindful of more progress that we need to make.  For example, work is well under way on Ireland&rsquo;s second national action plan under the Open Government Partnership.<\/p><p>Significant progress continues to be made on the open data initiative.  Ireland's open data portal,<i>data.gov.ie<\/i>, now contains over 4,400 datasets from 90 publishers and is growing all the time.  A data-sharing and governance Bill is also being prepared to simplify data-sharing between public service bodies while also protecting the rights of individuals. <\/p><p>The Public Sector Standards Bill is designed to modernise, simplify and streamline the current framework for ethics, which is in urgent need of reform.  Initiatives such as these are vital if we are to achieve fully the objectives of increased transparency, integrity and accountability underlying the Government's reform of our public life.<\/p><p> I will conclude by turning to some other Votes in the Public Expenditure and Reform group.  The roll-out of shared services and the reform of public procurement are central in delivering the efficiency focused reforms set out in the public service reform plan.  In this regard, the combined 2016 allocation for both the National Shared Services Office and the Office of Government Procurement is now &euro;57.8 million.  The 2016 allocation for Vote 2012, that is superannuation and retired allowances, is just under &euro;527 million gross or &euro;392 million net.<\/p><p> Each year there is a net increase in the number of pensioners due to retirements.  It of course has the effect of increasing payroll cost year-on-year.  In addition, Civil Service demographics means there has been an increase in the numbers eligible to retire in recent years.  For these reasons I expect the gross expenditure Estimate for 2017 to be higher than the 2016 Estimate.  There will be an offset in increase in the receipts to the Vote.  The committee has been supplied with a detailed briefing by my Department's officials on the various Votes in the PER group, including those of sub-offices.<\/p><p> The final matter I want to address is the new statement of strategy.  Members will be aware that the development of a three-year statement of strategy is a requirement for every Department under the Public Services Management Act 1997.  Under the legislation a new statement of strategy must be submitted to a Minister within six months of his or her appointment.  Therefore, the process to develop a new statement is under way in all Departments, including my own.  This work will, of course, be informed by the priorities set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government and the overall economic budgetary and fiscal context.<\/p><p> The development of this strategy is extremely important for every Department in terms of their mid-term direction, their business planning, how they allocate resources and manage risk, and provides a framework for reporting on progress made during each year of the strategy.  It will be a timely opportunity take stock, to look at what we have delivered, to look at choices, challenges and risks, to re-examine our values, our strengths and capacity to deliver on our strategic goals.  I invite members of the committee to share their views on this matter and ask that they be good enough to write to me by the middle of October on this matter.  I will  benefit from hearing the views of the members.  <\/p><p> While we have achieved much we are still borrowing to fund public services and debt remains high.  The objective of delivering and improving public services within budgetary parameters remains a huge goals for all Departments and offices.  I look forward to hearing the views of the members on how we can maintain public finances while meeting the needs of those we serve.  I thank members for their time and look forward to answering questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016092900002#DD00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2165,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016092900002#EE00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2166,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p> <p>  One of the more interesting parts of the expenditure report was the part on expenditure rules.

We have seen that over time, in line with a recovery taking place, we have been able to increase investment in the hiring of more public servants.  For example, since the beginning of 2015, when the economy created the resources to do it, we have been able to hire more front-line public servants, including more people working in health, teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, resource teachers and garda&iacute;.  Since that point, the number of people involved in front-line services has increased by 8,500 to 298,000, so there has been an increase in the number of people doing that work.

Therefore, we are seeing wage restoration take place through the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The Deputy asks me why we cannot deliver full wage restoration, which equates to reversing out of the FEMPI legislation and going back to pre-crisis salary levels.  The answer is that money is not available to the Government to do so.  He asked me earlier about fiscal space and what is available.  There is &euro;600 million available to the Government and we must balance the need for better services and more services that the country wants with our ability to properly pay people who are delivering those services.  That is why the Lansdowne Road agreement is so important.  We are restoring wages but we will have to do it at a rate that is affordable to the country and which ensures that we do not end up with an unaffordable wage bill in the future because when that happens, as I said in a previous hearing here, the unfunded wage increase of tomorrow is the savage wage cut of the following day.

The school transport system is chaotic throughout the country and we have no insight into how this money is being spent.  We have the section 38 and section 39 bodies in the HSE.  We have the general difficulty that the HSE does not have a single accountancy system.  We also have the various State boards which are funded by the State with little transparency.

While it is open to the Oireachtas committee to invite in the board, the CEO or the accounting officer, this does not happen regarding the accounts.  We do not have sight of the accounts.  We do not have a forensic examination of the accounts.  I use the example of CIE because it involves a significant amount of money, within which is the school transport system that receives a significant amount of money and, in my opinion, serious issues arise in this regard.  We do not seem as a State to be interested in pursuing the oversight of large amounts of money allocated through Departments to agencies and large organisations which provide services.  There seems to be a reluctance on the part of the State to do this as well as a reluctance on the part of the Government, not just this Government but all Governments I have seen operate in the past, to provide the appropriate powers to the Comptroller and Auditor General to conduct an examination of the spend of taxpayers' money to the point of where it is spent.  I say this because I served on committees where in opposition Members said one thing and produced reports but when in government those reports were never implemented.  This is not a criticism of this Government, it is every Government.<\/p> <p>  I am anxious to see the type of reforms that will give us oversight in a way that satisfies the Members of the House and the members of the public who ask questions.

The Minister should look at some of the answers to those questions.  One can ask six different questions about the school transport system and one will get the exact same answer, cut and pasted, which does not deal with the issue or answer the question.

Perhaps I now have a deeper understanding of some of these matters and the constraints on people when they answer such questions.  If we were to look at changes we have made to try to deal with some of the issues to which the Chairman referred, we recently launched a Government service of economists.  We have tried to bring together a group of economists, located in the Department, to provide me as Minister and the public a better economic appraisal of services we deliver.

We try to adopt the clearest stance we can on matters that are raised, but people can remain dissatisfied with they service they receive, be it in the school transport system or any other area.

On how Government money is spent and accounted for, I refer the Minister to the spending of taxpayers' money on the Galway project which was the subject of a \"Prime Time\" programme the other evening and the Tipperary hostel project.  There are various Government agencies involved in the Tipperary hostel project - I do not expect the Minister to know about it - on which &euro;6 million has been spent.

No Department will take responsibility for the delivery of the project or how the &euro;6 million spent could have been put to better use.  We could exchange words all day, but there are significant examples of the State not taking control of expenditure it has incurred.  There is significant proof, for example, that CIE in the case of its school transport service and many other agencies do not account for the spending of money, outside their audited accounts.  I am speaking about allocations from local government, direct funding from the State or a Department.  There is no comprehensive breakdown to show how money is being spent.

There is a difference of opinion, but I am not saying anybody has turned a blind eye to anything.  I am saying that, in terms of oversight, there is a gap in the legislation and the powers of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, a matter which could easily be remedied.

That would certainly bring about greater accountability and provide for greater and easier access by parliamentarians to accounts.  It is similar to the point I have often made about local government.  While there is a local government audit section, when does one ever see its work played out publicly?  That does not happen.  I know that each local authority is empowered to do so, but it does not happen in the same way that it would happen in the case of Parliament.  The point I am making is that in local government auditing involves an examination of moneys collected through rates and so on.

However, USC is pencilled in, which is over &euro;4 billion.  What is the Minister's position on those?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016092900002#JJ02700","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2265,"content":"<p>I will answer that question shortly.

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address the joint committee and I look forward to developing a constructive and interactive relationship with it on a range of issues of mutual concern to all of us and to the citizens of the State.  The committee has asked me to update it on a number of important initiatives undertaken by my Department and the Health Service Executive in 2016 and, more generally, to provide an update on the mid-year review of my Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2016, Vote 38, and a look ahead to 2017.<\/p> <p>  As requested, the briefing provided to Deputies and Senators concentrates on the issues in which the committee has expressed particular interest, namely, the recent drugs pricing agreement, the work of the emergency department task force, the planned winter initiative and proposals for a waiting list initiative in 2017.  As the committee is aware, in recent years, the Health Vote has typically required an annual supplementary budget to cover deficits.  In July of this year, in an effort to properly fund our health service and to break this cycle of Supplementary Estimates, the Government provided an additional &euro;500 million funding to health in 2016.  This level of funding also provides me, as Minister for Health, with the opportunity to address some immediate issues facing patients, such as investment in a winter initiative to manage overcrowding in emergency departments, in addition to meeting commitments in a programme for partnership Government.  It also places the health service on a sustainable financial footing by stabilising the finances for 2016 and allowing the HSE to set realistic and achievable targets for service areas.<\/p> <p>  In June, when I announced additional funding of &euro;500 million for the health sector, I emphasised the need for the HSE to deliver services within the funding provided by Government.  To ensure delivery of this requirement, I indicated that the revised allocation would be underpinned by an improved performance and accountability framework within the HSE.  This enhanced and strengthened framework ensures that designated health service managers are explicitly and personally accountable for managing the performance of services within their allocated budget.  The framework sets out clearly the consequences of underperformance.  Accountable officers are named for each hospital group, for each community health organisation, for the national ambulance service, for the primary care reimbursement service and for the nursing home support scheme.  <\/p> <p>  Accountable officers are required to prepare a financial plan for the year.  Each plan sets out the actions they will take to meet the agreed performance targets across the domains of access, quality and safety, human resources and doing so within the financial allocation.  The commitment to the plan and associated targets is formalised as part of the individual&rsquo;s personal targets under their individual performance agreements with their line manager.  All CEOs of hospital groups and chief officers of community health organisations have confirmed acceptance of the requirements under the enhanced performance and accountability framework.  Financial plans have been received from all hospital groups.<\/p> <p>  The framework requires early and assertive action to be taken in response to indications of an agreed target not being achieved and supports and interventions will be activated.  It is the responsibility of the accountable officers to produce remedial plans and to deliver on the agreed actions to bring performance back into line.<\/p> <p>  The additional funding provided has allowed us to deal with financial risks emerging from the beginning of the year and our expectation is that the health service will remain within budget for the year in respect of the core service areas.  For the entire Vote, at the end of August, actual expenditure for the year to date is &euro;9,145.1 million, against a profile of &euro;9,149.5 million, which indicates a positive variance of &euro;4.4 million.<\/p> <p>  There is a positive variance on current expenditure of &euro;18.5 million, which relates to the Department and non-HSE agency spending.  This largely relates to profiling issues rather than underspending and will predominantly reverse by year end.  There is a negative variance of &euro;15 million on capital spending which substantially reflects higher construction costs for profiled activity.  The HSE will manage the portfolio to ensure that the variance is eliminated by year end.  With regard to the year end position, it is anticipated that while there may be some areas that will experience overruns, these will be offset by underspends in other areas, resulting in an expected neutral budget versus actual position at year end.<\/p> <p>  Of significance, however, is the fact that the HSE&rsquo;s projected neutral position is prior to consideration of the State Claims Agency, SCA.  The full year outturn for SCA is difficult to predict and manage as the level of settlements are determined by court decisions rather than by the issue of management of the health service but we are aware of pressures and the position will require close monitoring for the remainder of the year.<\/p> <p>  Both the health service and the Exchequer face a huge challenge in the coming years due to growth in the cost of recently introduced medicines, combined with a pipeline of very expensive medicines.  New medicines pose affordability challenges for health care systems worldwide and also risk absorbing scarce resources which Governments will need to address a range of demands across the health service.  By way of context, in 2015, the HSE reimbursed &euro;1.9 billion on supply of medicines and appliances for the community drugs schemes and the high-tech arrangements, covering approximately 74 million separate items.  Almost &euro;1.3 billion went to pharmaceutical manufacturers - a 5% increase on 2014 levels.  In addition, expenditure on drugs in hospitals was estimated to be in excess of &euro;300 million in 2015.<\/p> <p>  Detailed preparation for the negotiations began in 2015 and involved a State team of officials from the Department of Health, the HSE, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of Government Procurement.  The formal negotiation process with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, began in March 2016.  The State's team objective was to improve the assessment and reimbursement process for new drugs and to secure significant price reduction so as to enable continued access to new and existing drugs for Irish patients while reducing growth in the HSE&rsquo;s overall drugs bill.  As I am sure the committee is aware, the negotiation process was not straightforward.  When I took up office as Minister for Health in May, I was briefed on the state of play.  The best offer that the industry was prepared to make did not meet the affordability challenges that the health system faced.  In turn, I briefed the Government to this effect and advised it that the HSE intended to exercise its statutory powers to reduce medicine prices to affordable levels.  I am glad that in the light of this development the industry reassessed its position.  After another intensive period of negotiation, the process resulted in an agreement which will provide substantial additional savings on the future drugs bill over the coming years.<\/p> <p>  The new agreement, which runs to the middle of 2020, is projected to result in savings, that is, expenditure foregone, of &euro;600 million from IPHA companies, with a further &euro;150 million in savings anticipated from non-IPHA companies over the lifetime of the deal.  The new agreement contains a number of features which represent clear additional value over the terms of the previous 2012 agreement.  Members of the previous health committee will see some of their own reports' recommendations reflected in this agreement.  It also addresses a number of issues raised by the Report on the Cost of Prescription Drugs in Ireland issued by the Joint Committee on Health and Children in 2015, including the expansion of reference basket of countries used to set prices in Ireland from nine to 14 countries.  Lower cost countries such as Greece, Italy and Portugal are included for the first time.  Annual price realignment will ensure that the prices of medicines in Ireland reduce in line with price reductions across the reference countries.  There will be an increased rebate in both PCRS and introduction of rebate in hospitals.  Also included in the agreement is a 30% reduction in the price of biologic medicines when a biosimilar medicine enters the market.  The issue of affordability is now central to the new agreement with an affordability clause to capture the five year cost of new medicines as part of the assessment process included.  This process is also aligned with the requirements of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  This ensures that reimbursement decisions will take account of the budget impact of an individual medicine, the opportunity cost of treatment and the resources available to the HSE as allocated by the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  The agreement with the IPHA is only one of a suite of measures that must be progressed if we are to ensure that we maximise the value of the State&rsquo;s expenditure on medicines.  One such initiative relates to biosimilar medicines.  I have asked officials in my Department to assess the whole area of biosimilar medicines and to work on the development of policies which will support the uptake of such medicines as they become available.  I note that Deputy Kelleher has recently published a Bill on this issue and my officials are examining this legislation.  I propose to consult with Deputy Kelleher on the matter in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  To date this year, we have seen improvements in emergency department overcrowding, with a decrease of almost 5% in the number of patients waiting on trolleys.  Hospitals have been driving improvements in patients&rsquo; experience times in emergency departments, with 82% of all patients completing their emergency department episode of care within nine hours of registration.  Also, hospitals are working to ensure that no patient waits over 24 hours in the emergency department and by August the number of patients waiting over 24 hours has reduced to 2%, down from 5% in January.<\/p> <p>  While these may seem like small steps they are, nonetheless, steps in the right direction and derive from a co-ordinated policy and operational approach across primary, acute and social care to tackle the multifaceted nature of emergency department overcrowding.  Under the framework of the emergency department task force, I have been driving a four pronged approach, involving a range of initiatives, to alleviate pressures on emergency departments.<\/p><p>There is so much more to do in this space.  First, my Department and the HSE continue to implement measures to increase hospital avoidance by developing alternative services to emergency departments, EDs, such as community intervention teams, GP out-of-hours services, as well as GP minor injury and diagnostic services.  Second, increasing hospital capacity has been and remains a priority.  Some 300 new hospital beds have been introduced into our system, new EDs have been developed in Kilkenny and Limerick, the number of consultants in our health system has increased by 80 full-time equivalents and the number of nurses by more than 200 so far this year.  The third series of measures has been focused on supporting timely patient discharge from hospitals.  Under the 2016-2017 winter initiative, which I will refer to in a moment, I have placed a strong focus on reducing delayed discharges.  Fourth, the special delivery unit has carried out review visits to almost all hospital EDs to evaluate how EDs can improve patient flow and drive improvements in how hospitals respond to peaks in demand for emergency care.<br\/><br\/>The reductions we have seen in trolley numbers and the improvements in patient ED experience times, particularly in the important context of significantly-increased attendances and hospital activity this year, indicate that last year&rsquo;s winter initiative has clearly had an impact on ED overcrowding.  Consequently, I was recently pleased to welcome the HSE announcement of this year&rsquo;s winter initiative 2016-2017, for which we provided &euro;40 million of additional funding.  Key measures include providing an additional 950 home care packages targeting nine specific hospitals, the provision of an additional 58 transitional care bed approvals weekly and the expansion of community intervention team services across four sites to support five acute hospitals.  This will benefit more than 6,500 additional patients.  An additional 55 acute beds and 18 additional step-down beds will be made available while minor injury services in Dublin are to be expanded to provide for an additional 100 patients each week.  Funding for aids and appliances is to be increased to reduce delays in patients being discharged back to their homes.  Funding is also provided for an increased focus on flu vaccination for health care staff and the wider community.  I am firmly committed to achieving a real impact on ED overcrowding as a result of the 2016-2017 winter initiative and I am chairing a weekly meeting with the HSE and my Department to monitor progress and to see exactly how we are getting on week on week in terms of implementing this ambitious plan.<br\/><br\/>It is my view that integrated, patient-centred approaches to winter planning, as has been done in the winter initiative, are key to ensuring that the health service effectively manages peak winter pressure times in our EDs in order that patients experience a safe and high-quality health service in the setting most appropriate to their needs.  I hope that when the committee sees and reads this winter initiative document, as it has been doing, it will see that the answer to all the issues in our acute hospitals and the pressure points cannot simply result in the acute hospital coming up with the solution.  We must have that integrated approach of looking at what we can do in the community, in social care, in delayed discharges and in home care.  We have tried to take a much more integrated approach in this year's winter initiative than perhaps in the past.<br\/><br\/>Moving to scheduled care, it has been and remains a concern to me that the number of patients currently on waiting lists has continued to increase over the last number of months and I wish to assure the committee that this Government is committed to driving the necessary process improvements and providing the resources to tackle this issue, as is evident from the programme for a partnership Government.  <br\/><br\/>In direct response to these recent increases, at my request the HSE has provided an action plan aimed at reducing the number of patients on waiting lists to be implemented in the latter half of 2016.  The focus of this plan is on those waiting the longest for inpatient or day-case procedures.  The HSE is committed to reducing by half the number of patients waiting more than 18 months for these types of procedure by year end.  Again, within current resources, the National Treatment Purchase Fund recently launched an endoscopy waiting list 2016 initiative which will also assist in reducing the waiting list and waiting times for endoscopy procedures for those patients who are currently waiting more than 12 months.  It is expected that around 3,000 patients will receive their endoscopy procedures under this initiative.  Furthermore, &euro;7 million of the overall &euro;40 million allocated for the winter initiative is to be utilised to fund a targeted waiting list programme for orthopaedic, spinal and scoliosis patients to be implemented in designated sites by year end in Beaumont, Tallaght, Tullamore, Waterford and Galway.  Separately, &euro;1 million has been provided to the children&rsquo;s hospital group on a once-off basis to address the cardiac cath lab and scoliosis waiting lists at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin.  <br\/><br\/>The programme for a partnership Government, as colleagues will be aware, clearly commits to &euro;50 million in 2017 for waiting list initiatives, with at least &euro;15 million of this allocated specifically to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  My Department, in conjunction with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, is working on developing a framework for the waiting list initiative in 2017.  I welcome the views of colleagues in this regard.<br\/><br\/>As budget day draws closer, we are obviously in close discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding increased costs and additional health priorities in 2017.  These discussions include the funding required to maintain our existing levels of service, funding for priorities included in the programme for partnership Government and the supply and confidence agreement and also funding to allow for the delivery of our capital programme in 2017.  Clearly, these discussions are taking place in the context of the fiscal constraints imposed by both the need to maintain economic stability and our requirement to remain compliant with the fiscal stability pact, most particularly the expenditure benchmark and the imperative to use fiscal space to support Government priorities.  In the recently published mid-year expenditure report 2016, the Department has been allocated an additional &euro;73 million for 2017 to support expenditure pressures arising from demographics.  While welcome, it is likely that the actual amount required will exceed this allocation, as we deal with a larger and older population with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and rising costs of health technology.  The costs of providing for retired health care staff and payments under the State Claims Agency are also rising, increasing the cost of health above that necessary to just meet the health demands of a growing and ageing population.<br\/><br\/>With regard to funding for new developments, the priorities will reflect the Government&rsquo;s programme planned over a three-year period.  This is an important point.  We need to look at the multi-annual picture here.  Where do we want our health service to be over a period of time and how are we going to take the health service on that journey?  Budget 2017 provides us with an opportunity to begin that.  We also need to look at what we are going to do in year 2 and year 3.  There are 132 commitments in the programme for partnership Government in respect of health, of which many have a financial cost.  I think that is out of an overall number of more than 600 recommendations, of which many have a financial cost.  It will be necessary to carefully prioritise and phase the initiatives having regard, as I have already outlined, to the fiscal constraints within which our country must operate.  I would welcome the input of this committee today and as we continue to undertake this exercise on where it believes the priorities should be around new developments over a multi-annual period of time.<br\/><br\/>With regard to capital, notwithstanding the challenges arising from the impact of inflation, we will see major initiatives such as the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, the new mental health hospital in Portrane and a substantial number of more modest but necessary projects across the country which are currently under way.  In addition, the HSE has developed an ambitious e-health programme and, through the Department and the office of the chief information officer in the HSE, has now built significant momentum and support.  There is an opportunity to further build on this in 2017.<br\/><br\/>While we<b><\/b>have secured a significant increase in funding for the health services for 2016, let me assure the committee that I do not underestimate the challenges involved in the delivery of a safe and efficient health service for the Irish people.  We must maintain our focus on improving the way services are organised and delivered and on reducing costs in order to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs.  We cannot just presume that the answer is throwing money at the challenges.  We must look at how we can better provide and organise our health services right across the spectrum of health care.<br\/><br\/>In order for Government to have the confidence to prioritise additional investment in our health services in 2017 and beyond, it is essential that those managing and delivering the service demonstrate good practice by delivering the best possible health care within the limits of resources that have been made available by Government each year.  I want to thank all of the health care staff and management who I have had an opportunity to interact with as I have travelled around the country.  I acknowledge the very good work they are doing in often challenging circumstances.  It is important that by living within the budget this year, we are provided with an opportunity to move on to new developments that we all want to deliver in terms of improving patient outcomes.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, I thank the members for inviting me here this morning and I will be glad to supply any further information that they may require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#C00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2307,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I wish to raise a couple of points on the issues he has discussed.  The first point is about the cost of drugs.  I want to know what the actual total cost is.  The Minister mentioned a figure of &euro;1.9 billion in reimbursement and another &euro;300 million in relation to the hospitals.  That brings us to &euro;2.2 billion.  I presume there is another &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million on top of that which we are technically paying out on pharmaceuticals.  Does the Minister feel that we could be doing a lot more in order to reduce that overall bill?  We have one of the highest expenditure levels <i>per capita<\/i>on drugs and pharmaceuticals compared to other EU countries.<\/p><p> The second issue relates to waiting lists.  I receive a lot of complaints from medical consultants in the HSE who have their own contracts but want to do more work.  They cannot get the beds and cannot get operating time in theatres.  If they were allowed to work in other facilities without affecting the hours they put into the HSE, a number of people could be taken off the waiting list.  I heard recently of six patients in a public hospital who were referred to a private hospital for hip operations and the HSE picked up the tab, which was &euro;10,000 for each patient.  Four of the patients had private health insurance cover but the money was not claimed from the insurer because they were on a waiting list in a public hospital.  Should we not look again at the fact that we cannot give experts the beds or the facilities but other facilities are available to them to carry out operations?<\/p><p> Since 2009 a lot of cuts have been made affecting junior doctors, such as in education grants.  A huge proportion of junior doctors are not Irish graduates and all Dublin hospitals have problems getting junior doctors.  Is this issue under review for 2016 and 2017?  It is a crucial issue that we are losing a huge number of very good people.  I am not talking about increasing salary but about restoring some of the grants which were removed from them in the past five or six years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#D00300","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2310,"content":"<p>We have concluded a very good drug agreement and I thank all the State agencies which worked very hard on it.  We got such an agreement because of the decision taken by this Oireachtas in 2013 to put legislation in place which enabled the HSE to set the reimbursement price, were the Government of the day not satisfied that it was getting the savings that were needed.  When Government was informed by the HSE that it intended to use this legislation, which received cross-party support and was recommended by the previous health committee, it got people back to the table and achieved substantially larger savings than we would otherwise have achieved.  This is an example of the good work that can be done by Oireachtas committees which then feeds into legislation and into a real benefit for the taxpayer.  The Senator is right, however, in that we need to do much more.  There is a medicines management group within the HSE and it has a number of ongoing projects.  There is a potential saving with regard to oral nutritional supplements of &euro;5 million per year and there is ongoing monitoring of preferred drugs and prescribing trends.  It is continuing to review high-tech medicines used in assisted reproductive technologies and is developing EU authorisation processes for these medicines.  It continues to look at ideas suggested by Deputy Kelleher in his legislation on biosimilars, on which I hope we can have a good engagement in this committee at a future date, and at enhancing evidence-based prescribing and optimising patient safety through a reduction in medication-related adverse events.  We are continuing to strengthen the audit function in respect of making sure we are paying the right prices in the case of dispensing fees.  There are a number of things we need to continue to do in this area.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's point about beds and operating theatres echoes complaints I hear from consultants and surgeons on a regular basis.  I visited Cappagh Hospital recently, where four of its six theatres are closed not because they did not have the consultants but because, under activity-based funding, they had run out of parts.  They had run out of the replacement hips and knees they needed to carry out procedures.  That creates huge frustration among patients who are waiting and creates huge issues in regard to retaining skilled professionals in this country.  I do not refer to this particular hospital but people are turning up for work and are not able to work to their optimum, meaning patients suffer.  For this reason I have made a decision to allocate additional resources to Cappagh in the budget for my Department and within the HSE service plan for 2017.  We have allocated &euro;3 million to Cappagh for 570 orthopaedic patients to receive funding through the winter initiative which will eliminate the hospital's 18-month target.  We have done the same for scoliosis and orthopaedics.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator asked whether I would be open to considering other arrangements and I want to be careful how I answer that, on account of the contractual positions that exist.  I hear what he said on the need to provide our surgeons with the opportunities to carry out surgeries.  The Senator will have seen that, in my five months in this job, I will not be imprisoned by ideology on this and I want whatever it takes for patients to be seen more quickly.  My preference would be to strengthen the public system so that doctors and surgeons have the necessary facilities but I will keep his suggestion in mind.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on NCHDs and this was a point made to me when I first engaged with junior doctors on taking up this role.  While there are pay issues across the public service that are dealt with centrally through our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, there are issues above and beyond pay that can have a real impact on recruitment and retention of our health care professionals.  I hear, loudly and clearly, the point on the need to provide the same training opportunities and career advancement as exist in other jurisdictions not too far away from here.  This also follows the report which we are working our way through at the moment.  This is a priority area.<\/p> <p>  We have not listened to NCHDs often enough in the health service and their voice has not been heard enough outside of the normal industrial relations mechanisms.  In terms of policy engagement it is important we do not just hear the voice of certain grades within our health service but that of everybody.  A very good initiative undertaken by the HSE is the creation of the lead NCHD role.  In every hospital I visit, junior doctors and NCHDs are making me aware of their presence.  The lead NCHD tells me what his or her team can do in the hospital to improve practice and process.  All lead NCHDs are brought together by the HSE senior management on a regular basis to have an input and this is something I want to see more of.  It is about issues other than pay, such as recognition, listening and the opportunity to feed in to decisions as well as training opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#E00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2311,"content":"<p>My first question relates to the Estimates and the new structure within the HSE, about which I heard from Fergal Bowers.  There is an advertisement on the HSE website at the moment for 21 senior managers.  People often say there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians in the health service and the HSE is not helping its own cause with that advertisement.  What are the estimated costs of that?  Every shilling spent on senior managers is not spent on front-line staff.<\/p> <p>  My next question is on waiting lists.  In the other committee, we had a presentation from the chief information officer and he outlined the decades of underinvestment, as well as the fact that we still lagged behind the rest of the EU with 3% of our budget going towards investment.  Hopefully, e-strategies will form a big part of cost savings in the future so can the Minister give some detail on the level of investment over the medium term in e-health?  I corresponded with the Minister on the Comhliosta system we are proposing, a model for which exists in Portugal.  Is an integrated waiting list part of the strategy which is on his desk and, if so, how much money has been put aside for it?  <\/p> <p>  Much of what the Minister said on drugs pricing is to be welcomed, especially the idea of getting people back to the table to talk.<\/p><p>On page 18, on the topic of principles and processes for the assessment of new medicines, a series of criteria are identified.  Are they weighted?  If so, what gets the highest weighting?  What way are the criteria weighted?  In the same section, a table identifies decisions made at the level of what is called \"HSE leadership\".  Who specifically are the people involved?<\/p><p> The Minister was talking to my colleague Councillor Natalie Treacy about her mother, Mrs. Vera Ronan.  I am interested to know what has been put aside for expenditure.  The Minister stated there are 950 home care packages but dementia-specific and intensive home care packages were also promised which would facilitate people with injuries, such as Mrs. Ronan, in coming out of hospital and being rehabilitated in the community.  These packages were promised but were not delivered.  We are obviously working off a very low base with this.  Are any of the 950 care packages specific to neurorehabilitation?  While we have the report and strategy, we do not have any specific dates for implementation.

To give the Deputy a little information, my understanding is that there has been a vacant deputy director general post within the HSE for quite some time.  Some members will obviously be aware of this.  There is a need to shake up the structure in respect of how people are reporting to the director general and the HSE.

I will revert to the Deputy on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to e-health, I am really pleased to hear the Deputy say what she is saying.  There has been a tendency in this country, and perhaps in others, to be dismissive of investments in technology and ICT and to ask why all the money is being spent on computers.  This investment is vital.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund publishes its waiting list figures every month.  While we can all agree the lists are far too long, none of us, including me, can delve down into the detail to the extent that we can determine how many times Mrs. Murphy is on a waiting list and how many doctors she has been referred to.  That level of detail is needed to make informed policy decisions.  We will have &euro;50 million for a waiting list initiative under the commitment in the programme for Government.  How best can we direct that?<\/p> <p>  I was taken by the Deputy's view on the Portuguese model.  I have asked that it be considered in the context of the technology being developed in respect of waiting list initiatives.  I would be happy to engage with the Deputy further on that.  There has been historic under-investment in this country on ICT.  We are seeing a new dawn regarding the work of the chief information officer and the e-health agenda.  There is a lot of good work taking place in this area.  By this time next year, every one of us will have an individual health identifier, IHI, whereby, for the first time, we will be individually recognised by the health service.  This is really important.<\/p> <p>  I am also considering using technology for basic tasks.  Some 15% of people on waiting lists are not attending their appointments.  My saying this is not blaming the patient.  If one is waiting a year for an appointment, one might forget about it.  It is not unreasonable for this to happen.  We should consider how we can do simple things with ICT, such as reminding people about their appointments using SMS.  Obviously, the do-not-attend figure results in a huge cost to the health service.  It is much higher than it should be.  I agree with the Deputy in this regard.  In the service plan and the budgetary process, I want to see progress on the health investment levels.  I hope the Deputy will see this reflected in my plans in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  Before I refer to the question of new medicines, I will refer to Councillor Treacy.  I had an opportunity to have a brief conversation with her when we met in RTE recently.  She has done superb work on highlighting an important issue.  I recently met representatives of An Saol, which is doing considerable work highlighting the really complex needs of their loved ones.  They have an absolutely understandable desire that the State, the health service, provide more than just somewhere for loved ones to reside and instead provide an opportunity so those loved ones can live their lives to their full potential.  Very interestingly, the proposals the An Saol representatives made to me in my conversation with them were based on the better use of the resources already being provided to their loved ones.  It is proposed that, instead of putting an individual in his or her thirties into a nursing home, one could actually reallocate the funding.  This is actively being considered.  An Saol has recently engaged with the HSE on this.  I am to meet Councillor Treacy shortly.  There is a date in our diaries.  I look forward to seeing what we can do to assist on the broad issue she has been highlighting.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy says, there is a strategy in regard to all this.  An implementation plan is due to be published this year.  This is where we need to get to, so we can align with our implementation plan the views of all the campaigning groups that have highlighted deficiencies in this area.  I look forward to the opportunity for Councillor Treacy, An Saol and other groups to feed into this process.  Senator Kelleher has a keen interest in this and we have engaged on it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the criteria and new drugs, the criteria are obviously the health needs of the public, the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services, and the availability and suitability of items for supplier reimbursement.  Nine criteria are listed.  They are outlined in the Act of 2013 and they are not listed in order of priority.  The challenge for the HSE is to balance all those competing criteria.  At times, they do compete.  The list of criteria needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>  The HSE leadership team comprises the directorate and also the HSE drugs group, which comprises clinicians.  Within days of coming into office, I was being contacted by people saying that if I did not provide such a drug, certain men or women would die.  That is not a decision I am qualified to make.  It is not a decision that any of us as politicians should be making.  What we have tried to do, therefore, is evident in the new agreement.  There has been progress made in this regard although the process is still far from ideal.  We need to examine what other countries are doing in this regard.  What we have tried to do is put in place a very clear set of criteria.  These criteria are to be considered by a HSE drugs group, comprising a group of clinicians.  It is the decision of this group to go to the HSE leadership team.  Ultimately, recourse to the Government will still be needed should there be a funding requirement above and beyond the funding available to the HSE.<\/p> <p>  I am going to Bratislava shortly to an EU health Ministers' meeting.  I want to engage with colleagues on what other countries do because I believe there has to be a better way of doing this.  Bearing in mind that many of us in this room will be Ministers on some occasions in our careers, I do not believe any of us want to find ourselves in a position in which the Cabinet or individual Ministers are playing God.  It is not desirable.<\/p> <p>  A very useful part of the agreement concerns looking forward, or the scanning exercise that will be carried out annually between the Department, the HSE and the industry.  In advance of the Estimates process next year, rather than this year, people will sit down to consider the pipeline of drugs.  That would better enable me, or whoever is in this role, to determine how funding might be put aside for the three, four, five or many more drugs that are coming down the tracks.  Currently, we can be taken by surprise somewhat.   Of course, we all want our loved ones to have access to a new drug that becomes available.  We must currently scramble somewhat to assemble facts, so scanning ahead for 12 months is a better system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#F00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2318,"content":"<p>Is the Minister saying all nine criteria have equal weighting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#F00700","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2319,"content":"<p>Yes.

The Minister made an informed contribution.  It is important that we interact with him and policymakers from all sides to ensure value for money and policies are brought forward that will underpin our basic commitment, collectively, to improve health services.  I do not expect detailed answers, but I would like some insight.  <\/p> <p>  On the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, the Minister has said he is not ideologically driven in how health care is accessed as long it is accessible and affordable and the waiting lists for inpatients, outpatients, day cases and so on can be addressed.  Have comparisons been made, for example, of the cost to the public purse of performing orthopaedic surgery in various public hospitals and between public hospitals and the private sector?  Very often, we simplify comparisons and do not compare apples with applies, but we need to do so in this case to ensure the public system is providing value for money and, equally, the private system is providing value for money and that NTPF money is not being eaten up in a manner that was unintended.  Is that information available?<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke has referred to an issue that has arisen in orthopaedics in Cork and elsewhere in recent years - hospitals running out of implants.  The South Infirmary Hospital was told at the end of September 2013, for example, that that was it for the year.  That is exceptionally frustrating for patients on waiting lists and senior, experienced, professional clinicians who want to get on with their job but who have to park surgical procedures, which is unacceptable.  There are huge funding difficulties, but there has to be a more imaginative way to ensure a pipeline of implants for knee, hip and other replacements.  Can the Minister be more definitive?  The issue of clinical staff being unable to perform their duties in expensive operating theatres has to be examined.<\/p> <p>  There is a reward for management in keeping hospitals full of healthy patients or patients who need low level medical support because if they admit high dependency patients or patients who need surgery, it will eat into their budgets.  We, therefore, need to be imaginative in how we address that issue.  Senior managers have told me that if beds are full of patients who do not need major surgery or interventions, they can stay within budget, but if they fill them with patients who should be in the hospital, it eats into their budget.  That is a perverse way of doing business, but it is happening in all the hospitals in the public system.  They are penalised if they ramp up activity and do what they are meant to be doing.  We have to examine this issue.<\/p> <p>  As I am ranting a little, I will move on to the drug pricing agreement, which I welcome.  It was a confident move by the HSE and the Minister to say they would activate the legislation if more flexibility was not displayed by the pharmaceutical industry.  However, in the next few years, there will be major challenges in funding health care generally and drugs specifically.  High tech drugs are coming on stream and more novel, innovative medicines are available.  That will continue to happen.  Is there a robust enough system in place to negotiate with powerful and influential organisations?  I do not cast aspersions, but is the system robust enough to enter into negotiations with these organisations, collectively and individually, and assess whether the State should fund these medicines?  Private Members' Bills have been introduced which would have put the onus on the Minister of the day to play God.  I do not accept that should be the case.  The issue should be depoliticised to the point where there will be a system in place under which, at the end of the day, an entity or a group of people will still have to make a call on whether a medicine should be made available that, unfortunately, could have life or death implications.  If all the funding is spent on medicines, that will have life or death implications in other areas of the health service.  The pharmacoeconomics group does its job, but I wonder whether we should revisit this system to ascertain what is best practice outside the country.  The Minister has said he will visit Bratislava, for example.  There were be a significant increase in the number of medicines coming on stream in the next five to seven years.  They will be expensive and almost tailor made to individuals through genetic profiling and so on.<\/p> <p>  On the emergency department task force, I criticise and compliment in equal measure; therefore, I am reasonably fair.  The Minister has said &euro;40 million is available for the winter initiative and to ensure the numbers of home care packages and home help hours will increase, which means that more patients will be moved out of hospitals.  However, after almost every initiative that has been implemented during the years, 700 and 800 patients remained in hospitals who should not have been there.  They are referred to as delayed discharges.  We were at a figure of 1,000 at one stage, but it has been pared back to 660 or 680.  Is there a systemic failing or is there insufficient capacity in the community care, social care and primary care systems?  We have had this problem consistently.<\/p> <p>  We have siloed budgets.  I have dealt with two cases in recent years in which high dependency home care packages were required for two children.  They were in Crumlin hospital and could not be transferred because they were from the country.  One cannot transfer budgets.  One manager in the midlands told us that they could not bring in the child because they did not have funding for the high dependency home care package, yet management in Crumlin hospital wanted to move the child out, while the parents wanted to bring the child home.  One has to wonder if there is any ability to cross-manage budgets in a way that would make sense for everybody.  Clearly, that would have been in the interests of the hospital, the patient and the parents and it should have been done.  Reference was made to the HSE, various directors and so on.  Could we end up siloing everything again under the various headings such as community care, social care, mental health and so on?  When the Minister examines this issue, he should ensure there is flexibility at directorate level, otherwise we will end up with these difficulties.<\/p> <p>  On e-health, Deputy Louise O'Reilly referred to the challenge in large organisations in introducing new technologies - whether they have the capacity to implement and develop them.  There is major resistance to them, but sometimes they just do not have the capacity.  Have the HSE, the Department and the hospital groups the capacity to embrace these new technologies and ensure staff will be able to use them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#G00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2327,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  He has made many points and I will try to go through them as quickly as I can.<\/p><p> With regard to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, the Committee of Public Accounts did some work on this a while back and found there was value for money from the fund, although there is a case to do more.  The activity-based funding model we are moving towards will enable us to have a much quicker look at value for money.  It will create data on, for example, how many procedures were done in a certain public hospital for a certain amount of money, which will provide us with a level of data in regard to public hospital costs which, to be frank, we do not have to the quantity we need.<\/p><p> I want to be clear in regard to the NTPF that I am very eager it does not just do outsourcing but also does insourcing.  This is not all about private hospitals or private health.  It is about accepting we have too many people waiting too long and we need to come up with a pragmatic solution.  I believe the Deputy and I share a view on this.  Some of our public hospitals have spare capacity.  We should be funding them to do the procedures.  The job of the NTPF is not simply to come in and outsource everything to the private sector.  It will have a dedicated fund to get through the waiting lists in the most efficient and pragmatic manner for patients, be that in a public or a private hospital.  However, I make the point that there is spare capacity, and Cappagh hospital is an example of spare capacity within the public service that we have tried to ramp up through winter initiative funding.<\/p><p> The other part of the value for money question we have to consider is where there is not capacity.  There are parts of the public sector where, even if it is more efficient to carry out procedures there than somewhere else, there may not be the capacity there today, whether in terms of theatre nurses, whom we are having a difficulty attracting, or in terms of the infrastructure of the building.  These are all issues we have to address but they are not going to be addressed today or tomorrow.  The patient is waiting and, therefore, the value for money question becomes less relevant and it becomes a question of where we can get the patient seen now.<\/p><p> The Deputy made a point about running out of money for implants.  This is a huge challenge and we have to do much better.  I believe the NTPF will provide a pipeline of work that will enable us to better predict what we actually need to do.  When I met NTPF representatives recently, I was very encouraged that they were able to say that if I provided them with X million euro, they could do a certain number of procedures, and if I provided Y million euro, they could do a certain other number of procedures.  This will provide a degree of certainty to the Irish patient that X number of tens of thousands of operations will be done in certain specialties under the NTPF and this will bring down waiting times for those procedures.  That is something we badly need.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to the group structure, which is something we need to stress-test much further.  The whole idea of the group structure is using each hospital within it in the most effective way.  There will be the acute hospital, the level 2 hospital and the level 3 hospital.  Moving patients between hospitals to get them to the most appropriate setting for their needs is happening very well in some hospital groups.  I note the links between Beaumont Hospital and hospitals in County Louth, such as Louth County Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, and in Cavan.  We see patients being moved from Beaumont Hospital and getting a procedure done very quickly in Cavan Hospital.  To be frank, that is not happening enough in every hospital group and it is something we need to do more on.  I agree with the Deputy on that.<\/p><p> With regard to the drug pricing agreement, the Deputy is correct that we are facing a huge challenge, not just in this country but globally in terms of the availability of drugs.  We have a very good and proud record in this country of providing our patients with access to new drugs and we bear up very well in terms of international comparisons.  The drug pricing agreement is not going to see us, in any way, shape or form, spend less on drugs but it will see us have some degree of headroom to purchase new drugs for our patients.  The robustness question is a fair one but I am satisfied that the State showed its robustness this time.  The industry certainly found this in the sense that it had thought it would be able to put in place a deal that would achieve a certain amount of savings and it ended up delivering a deal with the State that has brought a significantly larger amount of savings.<\/p><p> The point both the Deputy and I are grappling with, and it is a point on which I would appreciate the committee's help, is how we can do this better and what is best international practice.  I am talking to other European health Ministers in this regard.  I have heard ideas from the Deputy's own party in regard to the creation of a fund.  I am not against that and I believe there is a logic to it.  However, there is still a difficulty as to how it can be funded enough, how we know how much is enough, who accesses the fund and what are the criteria.  As an Oireachtas, or as a committee, we can do a very useful body of work.  I would certainly appreciate the views of the committee in terms of best international practice in this regard.<\/p><p> Another point I would make in regard to the drug pricing agreement, which I believe shows the robustness of the State's side, is the frequency of the price realignment.  We do not have a static deal that states we are paying so much for every drug for the next number of years.  There is an annual pricing realignment built in that can see us benefiting on a year-on-year basis from price reductions, obviously with reference to a larger basket of countries, including a number of lower-priced countries that were not included previously.<\/p><p> In regard to the winter initiative, I am convinced the key to making progress in our emergency departments lies with delayed discharges.  The figure I was given yesterday in regard to delayed discharges is 629, which is still far too high, and while it has been higher and has been lower, it needs to be much lower.  As I have tried to delve into this, I have found a number of reasons as to why there are 629 patients in hospitals today who medically do not need to be there.  For example, there is a degree of capacity in the private sector in certain geographic areas to provide home help.  If one goes to certain hospital on the north side of Dublin and goes into its bed management room and looks at the people listed on the whiteboards, they will have funded home care packages but they do not have anyone to provide them.  It is an issue the HSE is working on.  While we are making some progress on that, it is partially to blame for that large figure.<\/p><p> There is the issue of nursing homes.  This is a very big decision for any patient to make and the State should not be imposing a decision on what nursing home an older citizen wants to go to, or if the person is not in a position to make the decision, where their family wants them to go.  The person might want to go to nursing home X but there might not be a place in that nursing home today or tomorrow.  We have to grapple with the fact that it is fine that the person gets to wait for a nursing home as it is their decision, their dignity, their life.  However, is there not somewhere better for the person to be, other than the acute hospital bed?  This brings in the whole question of transitional beds and we see in the winter initiative the commitment to opening more transitional beds.<\/p><p> Let us not ignore the elephant in the room.  The Deputy makes a significant point that the silo mentality is something we have to look at.  I have resisted saying too much on this because I know the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, of which a number of members of this committee are members, is looking at structures.  I want to try to get to this cross-party agreement on the ten-year plan, as we all do, which is a huge body of work.  I personally believe there is significant merit in looking at how hospital groups and CHOs operate.  If people are protecting budgets, with the hospital protecting its budget and the community protecting its budget, and the person in the hospital who needs to send a patient home today does not actually control the budget for home care, that is a problem.  I intend to act on it but I would like to see if we can arrive at a conclusion as part of the work that is ongoing in that committee and I do not want to wrongly interfere.  However, I accept the silo piece is a legitimate point of criticism and something we need to deliver on.<\/p><p> I am glad the Deputy raised the point about children.  There is a view at present that we are just building a national children's hospital, which we are, but we are doing so much more than that.  We are building a hospital in Dublin and we are building satellite units in Dublin but we are also putting in place a paediatric model of care so any child, anywhere in this country, will be under the umbrella of a children's hospital group.  Therefore, we will not have silly situations which have an adverse impact on our children because they are stuck in one hospital because someone else will not talk.  I intend to bring that paediatric model of care to Government shortly.  I am also engaging with the boards of the existing children's hospitals.  I have met two of them and am meeting the final one in the morning.  I intend to bring the heads of a Bill to Government to move on with that new integrated model.<\/p><p> With regard to e-health, I am now satisfied that we have the capacity which we clearly did not have on the State side and the HSE side for a long number of years.  Excellent work is being done by the chief information officer and the e-health group.  As a GP himself, the Chairman will know GPs are streets ahead of the acute hospital sector in terms of technology.  When a person goes into a GP, they are not tripping over paper files.  The Chairman should see the pictures I get sent of the paper files being stored in hospitals - there are warehouses full of paper files.  GPs have proven they can grapple with the e-health agenda and they are doing it.  We now have e-referrals in place where many GPs, at the click of a button, are able to refer a patient onto an outpatient waiting list.  The analysis my officials have done is that before that happened, the referral would have passed through 16 pairs of hands before the referral was made.  We will very shortly have e-discharge so the GP hears back that the patient is out of hospital and also receives the patient's notes.  We will have the individual health identifier and, ultimately, we will have the electronic health record by 2020.  There is a huge body of work going on and I am satisfied it is going well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#G00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2329,"content":"<p>I am here representing Senator John Dolan and I will be asking a question he particularly wanted me to ask.  I also have a couple of questions of my own.  One concerns the area of social care in general.  I have worked for Cork Simon Community, Cope Foundation and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and I am a social worker by trade.<\/p><p>As far as I can see, social care is the Cinderella of the health system in Ireland.  This is the case in any part of the system, whether one has a neurological disease or dementia or is a parent of a child with severe disabilities.  There are problems in every part of the system.  Social care, as part of the health system, is not functioning.  I hope the Committee on the Future of Healthcare makes recommendations on building a successful system.<\/p><p> Home care is a major part of the health system.  The 950 additional home care packages are welcome, but they do not meet the demand.  There are not enough and they are not getting through to those who need them.  The national dementia strategy earmarked 500 intensive home care packages, which is a very modest number considering that 55,000 people have dementia.  To date, only 85 people with dementia are benefitting from that. <\/p><p> Social care is the Cinderella, home care is growing but is still not anywhere near meeting the demand and services are not getting through to people or are always appropriate.  Some forms of home care involve personal care.  A person with dementia may not necessarily need to be dressed, but may need to be reminded to eat.  It is important that the form of care we are offering to people is correct.<\/p><p> Deputies doing constituency work will be more aware of that than anybody else because people are coming to their offices with concerns.  We need to know what will happen in 2017 in regard to that.  Will there be significant additional investment in home care?  Will it be able to cater for people who have, for example, dementia specific needs?  This issue is not going away and has a major impact on the mainstream system.  Even if one is not bothered by home care, as someone coming from my perspective might be, the number of beds and delayed discharges are having a major impact.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.<\/p><p> I am also concerned about waiting lists.  I received some information from my neighbour, who is a gynaecologist in Cork, about gynaecology waiting lists and I was shocked.  I understand the highest number of women in the country, 4,090, are waiting for outpatient appointments and 662 women are waiting for gynaecological surgery.  This is a critical issue for those women, especially those who have been waiting for a long time because their condition may be worsening.<\/p><p> Senator Dolan referred to the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Has that been provided for in the Estimates for 2017?  What is the status of the statement of the departmental strategy in terms of implementing that convention?  <\/p><p> My major concern is social care and, within that, home care.  I am anxious to hear from the Minister on that, in particular with regard to the budget for next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#H00200","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2331,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Kelleher.  I bow to her expertise in this area.  She knows the sector very well.<\/p><p>I refer to the Cinderella charge.  I do not want to dismiss legitimate criticism and problems the Senator outlined but in terms of what we are spending on the social care division - we may have to have a conversation about how this translates into services - the disability budget is &euro;1.5 billion, the fair deal budget is &euro;1 billion and there is another &euro;700 million budget for older people.  This is linked to my opening statement, in which I said we need to make sure funding is spent in the correct manner to deliver the services that people actually want to see delivered.<\/p><p>Senator Kelleher and Councillor Tracey convinced me that is not the case.  People I have met have told me they are not seeing the service they want to be delivered.  They have come up with better ways of delivering their own services within the same level of resources.  A detailed body of work has been done.  <\/p><p>I cannot get into specific Estimate discussions because discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are ongoing but the area of home care and home help remains an absolute priority for me and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, as the Senator knows.  She is continuing to engage and I hope I showed some good faith in terms of the winter initiatives where, as the Senator said, we increased the number of home care packages quite significantly, by another 950, in recognition of the points she made.  There is a significant correlation between the inability of someone to act as a home care package and the likelihood of that person ending up in hospital and remaining there for much longer than he or she medically needs.  We are <i>ad idem <\/i>on that.  How we translate that into benefits on the ground is what we need to work on.  <\/p><p>As the Senator has outlined, some people have very complex needs, and have the right to be cared for in their community and home and to live in their home and community for as long as they possibly can.  The rigidity of the current system is something we need to examine. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is doing a considerable amount of work on this and I hope we will be able to show, in the multiannual sense, as discussed previously, incremental progress to get us where we need to get to.  <\/p><p>I will examine gynaecology waiting lists in Cork and revert to the Senator in terms of ascertaining the current situation.  My Department is scoping a winter waiting list initiative for 2017.  If we get what is committed to in the programme for Government in the ongoing Estimates process in terms of waiting lists, we will examine how best to spend that money.  We will target particularly challenging waiting lists.  We will start with people who have been waiting the longest, which is the fairest way of doing it.  We do not need to have a national treatment purchase fund, which is a convenient tool for keeping waiting lists low but ignores the fact that some people have been waiting a very long time.  We will also examine specialties where there are particular limitations or challenges.<\/p><p>In the current year's Estimates, funding has been allocated for the HSE to develop the women and infants health programme, which comes under the national maternity strategy.  I am very proud to say that we have a national maternity strategy.  It somewhat boggles the mind that this is the first time we have had one.  It is a very impressive document, and now we need to bring it to life.  The women in health programme in the HSE will do that.<\/p><p>The UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities is a priority project for my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath.  He is working extraordinarily hard across a number of Departments to deliver this.  It involves health, justice and other areas of Government that need to be pulled together.  The plan is to try to get this done by the end of the year, but I will ask the Minister of State to update Senator Dolan and the committee by way of letter on the current position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#J00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2332,"content":"<p>It needs to be included in the Estimates because there will be costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#J00300","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2333,"content":"<p>Without getting into the specifics of the Estimates, this is a priority in the programme for Government.

The first issue I want to speak about is the State Claims Agency, which is mentioned in regard to budgets.  I want to focus on maternity care, in particular cases where a woman goes into a hospital to deliver a child and something goes wrong at the birth, for whatever reason - I am not saying it is the fault of the HSE or a doctor.  I would like to highlight to the committee and the Minister the process women and families have to go through when mistakes, alleged or otherwise, are made.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to the national maternity strategy.  When women go into hospital to have children and something goes wrong, they have to go home and deal with children who, while they are alive, may have a disability as a result of birth.  Women and families have to go through a process to be heard.  Parents do not expect this to happen to them and they have children to care for who may need additional physiotherapy and all sorts of care. <\/p> <p>  The process involves State legal teams, and women also have their own legal teams.  Every gynaecological examination needs to be done by two sets of people.  Life is bad enough for the women this has happened to and who have been left with children to care for.  The State helps in terms of the provision of services such as the Central Remedial Clinic or whatever.  It is something on which we need to work.<\/p> <p>  It is bbarbaric that a woman would have to be examined from head to toe, foot to knee or wherever by two separate sets of medical experts.  To my mind, women are degraded and demeaned by that.<\/p><p>It is something, for the sake of the women of this country, that we need to consider and speed up this process.  If something has gone wrong then we must learn lessons from the incident.  From the patient's point of view, the process has huge mental health implications.  People may say they are well and do not intend to pursue the matter further.<\/p><p> Deputy Louise O'Reilly mentioned the HSE structures and a tweet by Fergal Bowers that I did not see.

It would be regressive if the HSE went about fixing itself without the involvement of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare because that is the purpose behind the establishment of the committee.     <\/p><p> It is great news that 80 consultants have been recruited this year.  I agree with the Minister that things other than pay matter to people.  For example, training opportunities, grant supports and clear career pathways from junior doctor to the Holy Grail of being a hospital consultant.  Appointment to a consultant position is usually the ultimate aim of dedicated clinicians.  It is imperative that we support career pathways and do not lose people that have been educated in this country.  My sister is a hospital consultant and she emigrated to Australia.  I am sure she cost the State a fortune to educate but she will never return.  We must look at recruitment.  We need to provide support to  junior doctors and non-hospital consultant doctors in order for them to progress in their careers.  One of the great failings of the health system is that we do not have enough indigenous trained medical people who are used to our system.  Instead, they are leaving the country.<\/p><p> In terms of drug pricing, the Minister mentioned assisted reproduction and high-tech drugs.  The Minister need not give me answers today to the following questions as I can get them off him again.  Was he referring to drugs that are used for IVF or any sort of assisted reproduction?  Have the drugs been removed from the high-tech list?  Are they no longer allowed on the list?  What is the position?<\/p><p> A drug called Humira is used by some hospital consultants in IVF treatment.  The drug is made by AbbVie and is not licensed for IVF treatment but for another purpose.  The patient must pay the full price of &euro;1,550 for two injections of the drug.  People do not like to talk about the cost associated with assisted reproduction or IVF but it is astronomical.  Many of the drugs used in this process are high-tech drugs.  The drugs are necessary and allow people to have much longed-for children.  <\/p><p> My next question is on the classification of high-tech drugs.  I am a community pharmacist but I used to be a hospital pharmacist.  We need to consider how drugs are classified as high-tech.  Ten years high-tech drugs were launched with bells and whistles, we all got very excited and we all had one small fridge.  Now community pharmacies have huge fridges full of high-tech drugs.  We need to consider why drugs are classified high-tech.  I am not suggesting that the following is the case but perhaps drug companies are going down the route of making them high-tech when ordinarily they would fall into a different classification.  <\/p><p> People are positive when we negotiate better deals with drug companies.  I want to mention something that happened during a recent debate in the House on a motion which covered among other matters the reimbursement for blister packing or phased prescriptions.  A Deputy mentioned that the synthetic cannabinoid Nabilone is used for pain relief.  The item is a particularly popular with the pain consultants in St. Vincent's as one tends to see spots of drug prescribing.  The reimbursement price increased from &euro;400 to &euro;1,200 for a monthly dose or treatment of the drug.  That meant in practical terms that a patient was prescribed the drug by the doctor, got their drug from his or her community pharmacist and went home.  Then the HSE rightly stopped paying for it because the price had trebled.  Sometimes when the Government cuts off the supply of a drug there is a legitimate and logical reason for doing so.  There are some Deputies who, on the one hand cannot say it is great that prices are going down while, on the other hand, asking for a drug to be in use.  They cannot talk out of both sides of their mouths<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#J00600","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2337,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy keeping this conversation all to herself?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#K00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2338,"content":"<p>We might as well all go home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#K00300","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2339,"content":"<p>I am messing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#K00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2340,"content":"<p>In light of the presentation at the ten-year health committee, e-health is very positive.

The Director General of the HSE has decided, as is his prerogative rather than mine, to restructure how people report to him within the HSE.  He issued a circular to his staff outlining how people can report to him, subject to him filling the deputy director general post.  That is the extent of the matter.<\/p> <p>  I take very seriously the point made by Deputy O'Connell.  The committee has heard me make the point already that I have ideas about things I would like to see changed and improved in terms of structure.  I have resisted doing so out of respect for the fact that we are trying to do something that we have never done before in this country - a ten-year plan with buy-in from all of us.  It is important that we do this work and I echo and reinforce that message with the HSE.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy O'Connell mentioned, the way we treat women and patients in this country when they experience a tragedy or an adverse event in our hospitals is shameful.  It is something that we should be collectively ashamed of.  The system is far too adversarial.  People who were preparing for a time of great joy - bringing a new baby into the world, bringing a child home and starting a family - have all of a sudden had that joy replaced with the most unbelievable grief and bereavement, in some cases, or extreme challenge in the case of finding that these parents now have the responsibility of rearing their child who has significant care needs above and beyond what anybody would have expected.  We need to reform this system.  As the committee will know, both the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and I are working hard to carry out reform.  I do not want to stray into her policy area.  The T&aacute;naiste has outlined that she will bring forward legislation on periodic payments.<\/p> <p>  Families do not want to go to court to get a lump sum payment.  They  want the care needs of their child met for the rest of their child's life.  The only people who benefit from the current system are the legal eagles.  We are funding a system that benefits the lawyers and not the patients.  We can no longer do that and we are not going to do so.<\/p> <p>  Where my piece of the jigsaw fits into all of this is the piece on open disclosure.  Since taking up this job I have had an opportunity to meet some people who have had bad experiences of the health services as well as, thankfully, many people who have had good experiences.<\/p><p>What the people who have had bad experiences and have experienced tragedies wanted was answers.  They wanted to know what happened.  As the Deputy correctly said, they wanted to get a sense that the system was learning, that they told somebody what had happened and that it was not going to happen again.  The way people have been treated in our health service in regard to this, historically and in the not too recent past, is not acceptable.<br\/><br\/>Equally, on the other side, we have health care professionals who want to be able to provide that information in a safe environment.  They want to able to provide the patient and the patient's family with information.  We need to put in place a structure and environment for everybody in which to do that safely and in an informative manner at the quickest point possible.  As part of that legislation, I will be bringing forward a piece about open disclosure, which I believe is very important.  I know the T&aacute;naiste is working on putting in place a much less adversarial system that should remove the occurrence of some of the dreadful experiences that the Deputy has outlined.  For my part, I want to create a culture within the health service which, in fairness, we are already trying to embed, around making sure that we support people at a very vulnerable time.  There is obviously a very strong patient involvement in the development of the national maternity strategy, as the Deputy will be aware.  There were two patient advocates who fed into this strategy.  Also, I recently launched the national bereavement standards for when things go badly wrong and people are bereaved for a variety of reasons within our health service.  Again, it was very important that the voices of the people who had been bereaved and who had an opportunity to meet at the launch in Farmleigh are also being fed into the process.  <br\/><br\/>We have a lot of work to do on this.  The way we have treated women in our health service has been completely unacceptable.  However, if one looks at the building blocks that have been put in place in very recent times such as the new national maternity strategy, the national bereavement guidelines, the policy of open disclosure, the movement to periodic payments, wanting to build a new national maternity hospital, which we have to build and which we cannot allow bureaucracy obstruct, and the women and children's health programme within the HSE, I believe we are at a very significant moment in making sure that we learn the lessons of the past.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of career pathways, I could not agree more with the Deputy.  One of the more enjoyable moments of this challenging job I find myself in is that every time I meet people in the health service, they tell me they want to do more.  I do not mean that flippantly.  Every single representative group that I have met tells me that they are skilled professionals, which they are.  They say that they could be doing more, whether they are radiographers, pharmacists, dentists, doctors, GPs or nurses.  What we need to do now is make sure that everyone in the health service is doing to the optimal level what they are qualified and able to do.  It exciting work and it will see real benefits for patients.  This idea that other jurisdictions would offer better career pathways, better educational opportunities or better further training opportunities is something we must grapple with and that is a priority for me.<br\/><br\/>I am very pleased with what the Deputy said about drug pricing and the narrative around that.  I find myself, as Minister for Health, having to bite my tongue, which is not a thing I like to do very often.  I follow Deputy Durkan's lead.  The moment I say, or anyone in my Department or the HSE says, that we are going to provide a drug is a moment in which we write a blank cheque for very large drug companies.  When drug companies talk to me about patients' interests, it is my job to look after the patient and the company's job to look after itself.  When we can align the two, it is ideal.  However, I am very clear where I stand and I do not need anybody reminding me about patients' interests.  That is our job in the Oireachtas, the Department of Health and the HSE.  Therefore, it is important that there is a process in place.  It is important that we try to find an even better one.  It is so frustrating for people.  I know that because they tweet me, talk to me, e-mail me and meet me on the streets.  They tell me that they want this drug provided and want to know why I will not tell them I am going to provide it.  What I will say to this committee and what I say to those people again today is the moment I say we will provide this drug is the moment I tie the hands of the HSE in the negotiating process which will hopefully lead to the provision of that drug. <b><\/b>It is a balancing act.<br\/><br\/>In terms of high-tech medicines, the line I referenced about assistive reproductive technologies is the fact that we are keeping under review the classification of the high-tech medicines and the effectiveness of the drugs on that list.  I will get the Deputy a more detailed note on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#K01100","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2348,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I thank the Chairman.  I congratulate the Minister and his officials for coming before the committee and engaging so openly and readily with it.  This is a big challenge for the Minister and for his Department.  The challenge in health has been there for at least 15 or 20 years.  Targets have been set many times in the course of that period.  However, they are moving targets.  By the time one attempts to achieve the target, it has moved again.  From what the Minister has told us, I would conclude that he is moving in the right direction.  The Minister will know better himself whether he will be able to hit the targets in one fell swoop.  That remains to be seen.  However, it would be hugely beneficial to the morale of the health services, the morale of patients who are on waiting lists and the morale of the people generally in the country.<\/p> <p>  Health services affect every single household in the country.  Various other services affect them for a period of their lifetime, but health services affect them for their entire lifespan.  We are allegedly growing older, some of us more quickly than others.  The point at this stage is that it is a better job to be able to take corrective measures halfway through a cycle rather than waiting until the end of the cycle when one realises that one's targets are not going to be met.  I recognise the danger there is of becoming a hostage to fortune and allowing outside interests to dictate where one is going.  The best of luck to the Minister with it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell rightly made the point about legal issues.  I mean no disrespect to my legal colleagues, of course.  The fact of the matter is simply that patients in general, but more often than not women, find themselves in enough difficulty facing a traumatic situation without having all of the legal consequences trotted out before them and having to undergo all the probings that take place associated with that.  Why is there not a system without prejudice that would initially examine a situation without making the Department liable for endless costs and whereby there would be some recognition of the trauma through which the patient has gone as a result of an accident or whatever the case?  One does not have to concede.  There are procedures for doing this.  I do not know if such an approach has been found possible.  I was involved over the years, as I am sure was everybody else here, with different patients who found themselves in that situation.  It is deplorable.  At the end of the day, when and if the case goes to court, having cost millions of euro in legal costs as well as everything else, the compensation has to take place.  Why not look at it at the beginning, try to cut the ancillary costs and move towards that?<\/p> <p>  To what extent can one avail of the benefit of membership of the European Union in the control of drugs?  It is a large market of 500 million people.  When I was a member of a health board we had this argument.  There is always a tendency for the drug manufacturing companies to exert power and influence to the detriment of smaller countries and allegedly smaller markets.  We are not a smaller market.  We are a very large market.  We require and demand the best that is available through that.<\/p> <p>  The issue of waiting lists is something that has been going on for years.  The Minister is moving in the right direction with his initiative.  Hopefully, the combination of the primary care centres on the one hand, strengthened services through the GPs on the other hand and step-down beds will enable a more accelerated programme to develop.  Over the years I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions on the effect of the primary care centres on the waiting lists in their adjacent hospitals.  The answers I received were not convincing.  I have visited some of the hospitals adjacent to primary care centres and have found that the patients in many cases are referred past the primary care centre and on to the general hospital.  That should not be happening.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue that my colleagues have made reference to around attracting, educating and retaining medical staff of all levels in the country.  That is a problem.<\/p><p>Unfortunately we are not likely to have the climate they enjoy in Australia.  We will never have it.  It will not happen that way.  There has to be some other way we can encourage our qualified medical people to remain in this jurisdiction, at least for a while, to benefit the health services here and to benefit themselves.<\/p><p> To what extent does the Minister see the GP contracts featuring in this in the first instance?  Does he see an opportunity there?  We have had much criticism of the GP contract in recent years and dissatisfaction, particularly in rural areas but also in urban areas.  To what degree does the Minister see the possibility of dealing with it?  This is the first step.  If this cannot be resolved at an early date, then the other down the line issues will accumulate and continue.<\/p><p> I am suspicious about the availability of drugs at a very high cost.  They are under patent for a certain number of years but it worries me when I see the costs associated with them.  Whatever moral pressure can be used, even if it involves using the resources of the European Union, it should be done.<\/p><p> I congratulate the Minister on the initiatives so far.  He mentioned who has control over some aspects of policy in the HSE.  The Minister has control and he needs to exert it.  The delivery of the services is under the amorphous mass of the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE.  The HSE is the instrument which delivers at the coal face.  There is a tendency from time to time for policy decisions to emerge as if they were by gradual growth and development over time.  Not all of these decisions are soundly based and I am concerned about them.  The important thing in all of this is that the decisions ultimately rest with the Minister.  In the old days one tabled a question in the D&aacute;il, which was answered by the Minister and one received the reply immediately.  That was in the days of the health boards.  We did not have to wait for anything.  Then the HSE came on the scene and when that happened we received no answers at all in the House on issues relating to what the HSE was doing.  That was appalling.  Five years ago a change was made to the effect that we wait for 15 days and then get the answer.  It is an improvement but more needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#L00300","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2351,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan and I assure him I am very clear on how policy is made in health, and in every other area.  Health policy is made by me, in consultation and with the agreement of the Oireachtas, advised by the Department.  The job of the HSE is to get on with implementing and delivering it and dealing with operational matters.  It has a lot to keep it going on this front in a very busy health service.  We work very well with it in this regard.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputy Durkan for his kind words.  I agree with him that the health service faces a huge challenge.  This is the case not only in Ireland but throughout the world.  We see the impact of health debates in many other countries.  There is a tendency to always believe faraway hills are greener.  People speak to me about the NHS as though it were a magical wand solution and if we just lifted it and put it in Ireland everything would be wonderful.  However, if access information on the NHS, for example through Google, we will see references to doctor strikes, financial sustainability and bed capacity issues.  These are many of the issues we are debating at this meeting today.  There are challenges in every system and there is no such thing as a perfect system.<\/p> <p>  I am genuinely positive about this, and while I was getting all of the messages of sympathy wishing me well in Angola, as it were, and telling me to be careful of the poisoned chalice, I do not buy that.  Many positive things happen in our health system and I am more convinced of this than ever.  This is not to in any way belittle or dismiss the huge challenges that exist for patients and staff in areas of health service.  If we look at the five-part series on RTE, \"Keeping Ireland Alive\", which showed the many excellent practices going on in the health service, and matters such as life expectancy and how we deal with things such as cancer, cardiac care and stroke and the progress being made in Ireland - this is not a political point as it has been made over successive years by health care professionals - we have a lot going right.<\/p> <p>  The key issue is whether we can do what we have never done before, which is stop playing politics with the health service.  This does not mean stopping holding me to account for the day-to-day running.  I get this, and there is plenty for which to hold me to account on a day-to-day basis.  That is fine and that is politics, but can we do something we have never done before, which is agree, no matter who wins the next election, the one after that or the one after that, on a direction of travel for the health service?  If we can do this we can break the cycle.<\/p> <p>  What is happening at present is very straightforward.  Ministers turn up in Hawkins House, spend a period of time there and have a few ideas but because they may following a Minister of the same party or a different party, everyone has a different emphasis.  People make changes and begin a process.  Then the Minister moves on, a new Minister comes in and the whole thing starts again.  When I speak to health care professionals, managers and patients' groups, it is not fair to say people are fed up of reform in the health service, but they are fed up with little bits of reform and never getting to complete the journey.  In this respect the work done by Deputies O'Connell, O'Reilly and others on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare cannot be underestimated.  If we can get this piece right we can set the health service on a path of which we will all be very proud.  The country has done it before.  It has done it on the economy and on Northern Ireland and the peace process.  We need to stop accepting the premise, as Deputy Durkan certainly does not, that the issues in the health service cannot be addressed, albeit they are serious challenges.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right about the morale of staff in the health service and of patients.  We have a duty to provide them with a sense of a forward looking direction of travel.  This is not me sitting here suggesting we can rectify every issue today or tomorrow, because we certainly can not, but we can make inroads into all of the challenges we face in an incremental way.  I have a duty of care to staff and patients to outline to the Oireachtas in the coming weeks how I intend to do this.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Durkan on providing opportunity and space in the health service to provide information to patients who have had a bad, negative or tragic experience.  The Deputy is right that sometimes, very sadly, things just do go wrong and there can be a genuine tragedy.  In such a case the patient and staff need information.  I believe open disclosure, the policy we have in place but underpinned in legislation, will address this.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on drugs.  We cannot allow countries to be picked off by one another.  We are in a common market.  It is more complex than I presented it, but we need to examine how we can work at European level.  I have begun these discussions informally with colleagues and I hope to continue them at an EU Health Ministers meeting next week on an informal basis.  Some countries have already grouped together informally and they are beginning to see the benefits.<\/p> <p>  I am glad the Deputy raised the issue of primary care centres.  They have a huge role to play but not if we view them as only bricks and mortar.  I was in Senator Colm Burke's area recently, where he was a councillor for many years, for the commencement of works on what will be the largest primary care centre in the country.  It is fair to say there was palpable enthusiasm and excitement from the residents.  It is the largest public investment project on the north side of Cork in 30 years.  It is a huge project and will provide a central focus as the place for people to access primary care.  This is important.<\/p> <p>  Infrastructure is clearly important, and we must provide the bricks, mortar and facilities, but what is more important is what happens in the primary care centre.  The parliamentary question asked by the Deputy, which was legitimate as the Deputy's questions always are, is very difficult to answer because if the primary care centre is only largely providing current GP services and a few other important services, but not anything above and beyond what is been done at present, people will end up in emergency departments.  We need to look at what is being done in acute hospitals which does not need to be done there which we could provide in primary care.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to the next point the Deputy asked about, which is the issue of the new GP contract.  I know the Chairman has an interest in this and has raised the issue with me  To have a new contract we need two sides which both need something and I believe we have this.  I hear very clearly from GPs that the current contract does not work for them.  It does not enable or empower them to do what they believe they can and should be doing, which is what I also believe.  It also does not work for the State because it does not enable our GPs, who are our primary care providers, to do all they can.  Therefore, the mythical Mrs. Murphy finds herself in hospital because she cannot access services at primary care level, which our GPs are qualified and trained to deliver.  A big example of this is chronic disease management.<\/p><p>The data on chronic disease management indicates that the number of people developing chronic disease is increasing, with people above the age of 50 years often suffering from two or more chronic diseases and people developing chronic disease at a younger age.<\/p><p> If we cannot manage chronic disease in the primary care setting then no matter what we do in the acute hospital setting we will not address the challenges and, in fact, they will grow.  We intend to commence a contract negotiation process by the end of this year.  Along with my officials and the Health Service Executive I am looking at a number of options in this regard, including the most appropriate arrangements to engage with GPs and other primary care stakeholders.  I am eager not to go down a silo route in terms of having a conversation with only one group of health care professionals in primary care only to find out at a later stage that another group is doing work in this area, such that we end up duplicating work.  There is a piece of work that needs to be done in regard to engagement with all primary care stakeholders on issues such as what the future of primary care will look like.  This process need not go on for a long time.  We need to advance that process and to then commence the contract negotiations and put in place that structure by the end of the year.  Work in that regard is ongoing.  That could play a major role.<\/p><p> There are things that we are doing today in terms of helping keep people in their communities.  For example, the purpose of a community intervention team is to ensure that an older person is kept rehydrated within his or her home such that he or she does not end up in the emergency department.  Deputy Durkan will be aware that under the service plan for this year, an additional 1,030 patients will benefit from community intervention teams and another 6,643 will benefit under the winter initiative.  We are particularly and unapologetically targeting frail elderly patients so as to avoid their having to be admitted to hospital in the first instance.  All of the data indicates that when an old, frail person goes into hospital this can have a detrimental impact on his or her health.  If we can keep elderly patients in their home, and well in their homes, they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#M00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2353,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for being here this morning.

It is imperative that we ratify that convention for those people living with a disability.

We hope that its objectives and aims come to fruition.  It was reported that some of the additional 300 beds provided under last year's plan were unused as a direct result of a lack of nurses.  Does the Minister have any plans, aside from the daft - for want of a better word - plan of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor in regard to tax incentives and so on, to entice Irish nurses and doctors who went abroad back to Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#N00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2354,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for welcoming me to Bandon the other day.  We had a good day all around Cork but I was particularly happy to tell the people of Bandon that their community hospital is not only safe but will be invested in and has a bright future.<\/p> <p>  On the UN convention, I echo my comments to Senator Kelleher.  This is a priority issue not only for me and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, but for Government and, I believe, the Oireachtas.  We must get this convention ratified and we will do so.  As I said, there is a lot of work going on in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  I am grateful for the Deputy's comments in regard to political consensus.  It is important that we strive to have in place a strategic plan that can provide everybody working in the health service with a degree of certainty, which feeds into my response to the Deputy's second question.  If we can tell people working in the health service or aspiring to work in it exactly where we plan to take the service and how we propose to develop it, it makes it a more appealing place to work.  People do not want to work in an environment that is constantly changing according to plans and policy.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct on the beds issue.  We must ensure that everything we put into the winter initiative can be delivered.  The Deputy will have noted from my comments in the media recently that I was not happy to sign off on the winter initiative initially.  We want the metrics to be clear.  We are providing &euro;40 million of taxpayers money to the HSE to make improvements for patients and staff and we need to know what we are getting for it.  Therefore, we stress tested the initiative and identified what is provided for and so on.  I do not apologise for demanding that level of detail and I am pleased that we got it.  The HSE has clarified that the 300 beds provided under last year's winter initiative are fore-funded to be open this winter.  I expect all of them to be open this year.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised an issue in regard to nurses.  She is correct that there is a shortage of nurses and nursing graduates not only in Ireland but across many countries.  There number of nurses employed in the public health service in  Ireland increased by 1,163 between August 2014 and August 2016.  This means the number of nursing staff has increased from 34,375 to 35,712.  That is not to suggest everything is rosy because the numbers did fall by 4,000 from 2007 to 2014.  I hope that any nurse watching these proceedings will not think I am suggesting we are back to the levels we would like to be at.  We have a journey to go in that regard.  There are already a number of initiatives under way to try to improve nurse staffing levels throughout the country.  The most important initiative is offering people a permanent job.  We are not going to keep nurses in this country if they are only being offered a two or three month contract or temporary work when they know they can go across the sea to the UK or to Northern Ireland and get a permanent post.  In fairness, my predecessors were not in a position to offer permanent posts for a number of years.  These are now back on offer.  All of our nursing graduates this year will be offered permanent jobs in the Irish health service.  This sends out the important message that we are open again for business in terms of recruitment.  It will take time to build up confidence.  This is about the issues raised in the exchanges I had earlier with Deputy O'Connell, Senator Burke and others around career and training opportunities.  We need to ensure we keep nurse training opportunities in our health service well funded.  That is a priority for me.  <\/p> <p>  The HSE has launched an international staff nurse recruitment campaign, the purpose of which is to attract nurses back from the UK to jobs in Ireland, with a particular emphasis on nurses who left Ireland in the past few years.  These nurses are being offered relocation fees of &euro;1,500, payment of their nursing registration costs with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland and payment of post-graduate education costs.  This campaign is ongoing.  Approximately 420 applications have now been received, with 83 people having accepted job offers.  There are a number of other interviews scheduled to take place.  This scheme remains open.  There are a number of other issues, which I will not discuss in this forum, that nurses believe will make the viability of a nursing job in this country more appealing and sustainable, on which engagement continues.  There is a body of work yet to be done in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#N00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2355,"content":"<p>I, too, would like to raise some issues with the Minister.  The Minister referred to activity based funding in his opening statement.  I would like to explore the issue of moving from activity based funding to outcome based funding.  In a situation where one doctor sees 50 or 70 patients and another doctor sees 30 patients, the doctor who sees 70 patients will have doubled his or her activity but he or she might not have doubled the outcome.  The same applies in regard to hospital doctors who see an excessive number of patients in that their activity will be greater but the quality of care may be diminished by the fact that they are overwhelmed with work.  Perhaps the Minister would consider moving from an activity based funding model to an outcome based funding model in regard to patients, procedures and quality of service.<\/p> <p>  There is huge benefit to be derived from the integration of services.  In terms of IT, communication and medical records there is a huge amount of efficiency to be generated by having in place greater communications.  We  need to move to health records storage and access via cloud such that when a GP sees a patient he or she can access records to find out what treatment was provided by the hospital and so on.  This improves communication and the quality of care to a huge extent.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that point.<\/p> <p>  The community health organisations are currently being developed and will be rolled out in the couple of months.<\/p><p>The community health organisations are being developed and will be introduced in the coming months.  They are coming from the top down rather than from the bottom up and are viewed with some suspicion, notably by general practitioners.  GPs would like local integrated care committees, LICCs, such as those in place in County Kilkenny to be examined.  Under this model, all the components in the care process - general practitioners, consultants, nurses, HSE management, therapists and so forth - come together, treat each other as equals and reach an agreement on the best way to stream people in hospital.  If we can stream people into hospital efficiently, we can avoid them ending up in casualty departments unnecessarily.  They can be streamed directly into a bed or through a medical assessment unit, which avoids circumstances in which everybody ends up in the casualty department.  The problem with casualty departments is that they have a catch-all function.  Local integrated care committees are a more practical solution than community health organisations. <\/p><p> On recruitment and retention, if we can develop what I will describe as magnet hospitals that provide high quality care, these hospitals will attract high quality graduates.  This has been achieved in Kilkenny.  People want to come to work in the local hospital because its services are so well integrated.  The hospital deals with complex cases and more ordinary cases are looked after in the community.  This is the model the Minister wants. <\/p><p> Open disclosure is extremely important.  As practitioners, we intuitively want to make open disclosure, which is the modern way of dealing with problems.  It is not necessarily the case that a practitioner making an open disclosure is admitting that he or she was negligent or did something wrong.  The option he or she or took may not have been the correct one or may not have had the best outcome.  I ask the Minister to comment on the points I have made. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#N00400","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2357,"content":"<p>Where we want to get to with activity based funding is exactly as the Chairman outlined in terms of what we, namely, patients, citizens and taxpayers, are getting for the payment for that activity.  This must also take outcomes into consideration, which means not only whether a procedure was carried out but how the procedure in question went.  I must be honest and stated we are some distance from achieving this in terms of the development of the metrics required.  This is, however, the journey we want to take.<\/p> <p>  Regarding integration of services, I know the Chairman is familiar with this issue as he briefed me previously on the success of a number of general practices in networking and using technology.  An example is where a general practitioner is able to send an electronic record when he or she is on holidays.  The primary care setting, specifically general practice, has been significantly ahead of the acute hospital setting in this area.  We need to advance this process and the holding of health records in the cloud will be the key.  I add the caveat, however, that data security issues arise in this context because health records will be privately held and made accessible to various medical stakeholders. <\/p> <p>  On local integrated care committees, I will visit the hospital in Kilkenny on Saturday.  I hope to have an opportunity to meet the primary care group I am hearing so much about when I attend the Irish College of General Practitioners study day in two weeks.  This group is an example of best practice and I am aware of a somewhat similar model in place near my home town in Wicklow where general practitioners are interacting with St. Colmcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown in a manner that is working very well.  The Chairman's comments made sense but I will obviously await the outcome of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare's deliberations on structure.  I am aware the Chairman is a member of the committee.  We are promoting local integrated care committees nationwide.  Dr. Fawsitt has provided great leadership in this area and is promoting the further development of LICCs on behalf of the Health Service Executive. <\/p> <p>  On recruitment and retention, the Chairman is correct that hospitals operate as centres of excellence and engage in best practice, they will increasingly attract people to work in them.  The hospital groups will also help in this regard if we are able to recruit people on the basis of the hospital group rather than the individual hospital.  Each group includes a range of hospitals offering various services and we will need professionals to move between hospitals in the group.  I will not get into the business of naming hospitals but people will be more likely to gravitate towards a job in a flagship hospital, for example, one which is linked to a university.  We are now recognising that the university and group are all linked rather than the individual hospital.  This creates a different and perhaps enhanced environment.  The Chairman is correct, however, that recruitment and retention are still major challenges for all health services, not only the Irish health service.  We are moving into an era of reinvestment in health and providing a degree of certainty in terms of the direction in which we are moving.  We are advancing the recommendations of the MacCraith report, reviewing GP training place numbers and the GP contract and ensuring nursing graduates are offered jobs.  If we can sustain the current level of progress for a period, it will put us in a better place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016092900002#O00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1475136000,"counter":2358,"content":"<p>We requested that the Minister engage with the joint committee on the mid-year review of the Department's Estimates for 2016 and consider the proposals for expenditure in 2017.
