It made 22 recommendations, with 71 associated actions to be carried out.  The aim of the implementation of this report is to try to remove the volatility that we have seen with motor premiums in the past number of years, both up and down, and bringing the premiums from the very high levels into line with lower levels.  <\/p> <p>The report recognises that as there is such a range of factors that influence pricing, including the natural cycle of the market, consequently it is not possible to transform the underlying dynamic overnight.  It is worth noting that last month marked the first anniversary of the publication of the report.  More than half of the 71 actions had been implemented by the end of 2017.  Senators should note that the fourth quarterly update report will be published in the coming days.  This will give full details of the implementation of each of the recommendations.  The Government approved the general scheme of a Bill to establish a new national claims information database in the Central Bank of Ireland.  It has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.  This is a key recommendation of the motor insurance report as this database will collect aggregate information linked to claims for private motor business from motor insurers to provide greater transparency on claim trends.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I also acknowledge the work of the Personal Injuries Commission, which is chaired by former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns.

In this regard, work is continuing on important issues such as the development of an insurance fraud database in the Department of Justice and Equality and an uninsured drivers database in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The report provides us with a very good opportunity to address a range of problems in the sector.  The Senator can be assured that I will work with my ministerial colleagues to ensure that the cost of insurance is reduced.<\/p><p>There appears to have been greater stability in the market in recent months.  The most recent data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, indicate that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 16.3% from their peak in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability overall, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who are still seeing increases.  There is work to be done in this regard.  The Senator can be sure that the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the other Departments of Government, along with everybody involved in insurance, are attempting to ensure that the cost is reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021300002#B00700","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518532200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>This is a very important topic.

The broker went to a number of companies and eventually got back to the company this gentleman had been with.  He managed to get his insurance for the same price as previously because he used a different broker.  There are many anomalies in the motor insurance and it is difficult to put a figure on them.  That is the way the insurance companies operate.<\/p> <p>It is important for people to recognise a couple of factors.  The 57% increase was from a base that was too low.  Companies established themselves here and went after market share.  There was a price war and price wars never turn out well.  The cost of insurance was actually too low.  They were not operating from a proper base.  Reducing premiums by 16% is a good start, although it is only a start.  There are many other recommendations which will eventually be implemented.<\/p> <p>On the example the Senator gave, we are asking the insurance companies to explain why insurance premiums have increased.

As this country enters what we hope will be a period of prosperity, I dread and fear that history will repeat itself.  The one thing we should do as a society is learn from the mistakes of the past.  There is no doubt that mistakes were made within the banking sector and with the regulation of the banking sector.  Serious mistakes were made in the past by the Department of Finance, where the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is based, and by the Central Bank, which was governing the operation and regulation of the banking sector.  We had light-touch regulation in this country for far too long.  It did not work.  We need to move forward in a spirit of positivity and in an engaging way to do things differently and to avail of the best of what Ireland has to offer.  We have the best ICT skills in the world.  We have the best financial services brains and they are indigenous and organic to this country.  We can be the best in the world at community and public banking.  We have the skill set.

Local public banks in Germany, which are called <i>Sparkassen<\/i>, are not permitted to operate outside specific geographic regions.

To the end of December 2017, some &euro;925 million of SBCI supported lending has been approved for almost 23,000 Irish SMEs, operating across all sectors of the economy, including agriculture, food, retail, health care, transport and manufacturing.  The Credit Review Office, CRO, is a Government initiative that helps SMEs who had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks and feel that they have a viable business proposition.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The CRO has received almost 900 applications, with almost 700 cases concluded to date.  It has successfully overturned more than 50% of the decisions made by banks.  Over &euro;48 million has been advanced on foot of the CRO&rsquo;s recommendations and 3,750 jobs have been created or protected as a result.<\/p><p>In addition to these supports, the Department of Finance is working with other Departments to develop tailored and innovative schemes to meet the evolving needs of Irish SMEs, such as the &euro;150 million agricultural cashflow support loan scheme and the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme announced by then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in budget 2017 and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, in budget 2018.  Rural and regional development and supporting Irish SMEs to create employment and economic growth are important Government priorities and significant overall policy considerations.  The Department of Rural and Community Development will continue to focus on rural Ireland and rural and regional development generally and will provide a co-ordinating role across Government on this priority area.

I raise the issue of Newport day care centre in County Tipperary.  The centre was established in 1992 and now caters for hundreds of elderly folk from the parishes of Newport, Toor, Birdhill, Ballinahinch, Killoscully, Ballina, my own village of Castleconnell, Kilcommon and Rearcross each week in a manner that has changed the quality of life for many of them for the better.  A small team of ten health care professionals provide a wide range of community, health, well-being and respite services.  Without this facility, hundreds of service users would have to attend at the already vastly overcrowded University Hospital Limerick for their health care needs.  The staff have an extremely heavy workload and, like so many others in the sector, regularly go above and beyond their job specifications to ensure that the highest standards of care and support for their clients.  Above all, there is a great sense of community that runs through the heart of everything that is done at the centre.  The range of community and health services provided make a crucial difference to the lives of so many people in the Tipperary and Limerick region.<\/p> <p>The staff who provide this excellent range of services had their pay cut without negotiation in 2008.  A decade on, their pay remains exactly where it was after that cut.  They see their colleagues and other HSE-funded organisations that have benefited from pay restoration or other section 39 organisations that now, thankfully, have a means of redress through a structured and transparent pay restoration mechanism agreed between my union, SIPTU, and the Department of Health and the HSE.  Where is the roadmap for the workers at the Newport day care centre to achieve their pay restoration?  Where is their means of achieving any kind of pay rise after a decade enduring a significant pay cut which was imposed without agreement?  That pay cut was imposed as a result of a direct instruction from the HSE to the manager of Newport day care centre.<\/p> <p>We know this facility is suffering from significant underfunding.  We know it because the management of Newport day care centre has - in writing - cited underfunding as the reason they will not attend the Workplace Relations Commission; they have no financial means of addressing the claims of the SIPTU members working at the centre.  As management will not attend the Workplace Relations Commission, the workers concerned have no choice but to ballot for industrial action.  This is a publicly-funded facility.  Surely the workers must have some means of redress, surely they deserve some hope after years of loyal service and surely there is a responsibility on the Minister of State to make this possible.  I am asking her to include these workers in the mechanism for pay restoration for section 39 workers.  Otherwise they will be left with no choice but to initiate industrial action.  Nobody wants a strike to take place, least of all the workers themselves.  It will take place, however, unless the Minister of State provides a means for these workers to press their legitimate claim for pay restoration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021300002#F00300","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1518532200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I am responding on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  I thank Senator Gavan for raising this issue.<\/p> <p>The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live with dignity and independence in their homes and communities for as long as possible and to support access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate  The HSE has operational responsibility for planning, managing and delivering health and personal social services including home help, home care packages, meals on wheels, respite or day care and a range of other community based supports.  Services are delivered through the HSE and its funded agencies to people in local communities, as close as possible to people&rsquo;s homes.<\/p> <p>Our ageing population is one of the most significant demographic and societal developments that Ireland has encountered in modern times.  Not only are people living longer, but a great many people are staying healthier and living better for a longer time.  Demand for community services is rising as more people are supported in their own homes rather than in hospitals or nursing homes.  Access to day care centres such as Newport can make an important contribution by providing invaluable support, advice and social interaction for older people who may for any number of reasons be experiencing isolation and loneliness.<\/p> <p>The Senator asks about funding of the Newport day care centre.

I understand this is a ballot on the restoration of pay to staff.  The Senator will be aware that last Friday, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, welcomed a deferral of industrial action by section 39 workers.  He has also confirmed that the Department of Health, the HSE and trade unions have agreed that the HSE would carry out an analysis to establish whether supporting evidence shows whether, when and to what extent reductions in pay rates were applied during the crisis in each relevant organisation; whether, when and to what extent restoration of pay reductions have happened; and to identify financial implications for such organisations, taking account of all of the resources of funding associated with addressing the issue and identifying and proposing an appropriate plan of phased resolution in each case.  The HSE will continue the data gathering exercise immediately, initially in respect of an agreed list of organisations.  The data gathering exercise should be completed as early as possible.  An interim report is expected to be published by the end of March 2018.  <\/p><p>Dispute resolution in Ireland is based on the concept of parties voluntarily seeking to resolve their differences with industrial relations mechanisms provided by the State.  This would include availing of services provided by the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  The process I have set out should resolve the situation in respect of the pay issue in section 39 funded organisations at a national level.

Ms Hazel Robinson is the parent of a 15 year old daughter with cystic fibrosis.  She started this vigil because her daughter was recently obliged to wait over a week to secure a bed in the hospital after she contracted influenza, which compromised her health further.  Ms Robinson has faced the same problem on numerous occasions when trying to source a bed for treatment for her very sick daughter.  Many of the parents there last night share that experience.  What are we doing wrong?  Are we doing anything right?<\/p> <p>I have been working on a document, now ready for publication, which specifically focuses on Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, and what investment is needed and where it needs to go.  The stark figures and data, from parliamentary questions and from the Department itself, show that the inpatient waiting times for the hospital are unacceptably high.  The total inpatient day case waiting number for the entire children's hospital, which includes the other two hospitals, is at almost 5,000.  Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, accounts for over half of these.  The position is unacceptable, especially considering that many of the children are waiting with life-threatening and progressively deteriorating conditions.  The waiting list for children with musculoskeletal problems to access the orthopaedic unit is often 18 months.  That issue has been highlighted several times by the national public broadcaster.  <\/p> <p>I want to know what plans are in place to tackle the trolley crisis in our children's hospital system.  We know all about it in the adult accident and emergency departments, but the children and their parents deserve as much attention and dedication to solving the problem.  Is it the case that we are going to have to wait until the establishment of the national children's hospital in 2020 or 2021?  There is a significant timeframe involved here for sick children.  They do not have that time available.  I hope that the national children's hospital will be fit for purpose and have sufficient capacity, but what can we do in the meantime?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021300002#H00500","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1518532200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The Minister, who unfortunately cannot be here, has asked me to answer on his behalf.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge that there are some challenges in accessing services in the three children&rsquo;s hospitals at present. The Children&rsquo;s hospital group works with the each of the three paediatric hospitals to manage capacity challenges, providing support in terms of bed utilisation on a daily basis.  Within Our Lady's Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, all funded beds are open and currently in use, with the exception of one bed closed for renovation purposes.  The hospital group is working with the National Treatment Purchase Fund to identify clinically appropriate groups of patients for treatment as part of a waiting list initiative.  The hospital group also continues to work with the acute hospital division in the HSE as well as with staff in the mental health primary care and disability services to reduce the length of stay of patients in hospital and to improve pathways of care for children and adolescents, which will, in turn, ease pressures on hospital capacity.<\/p> <p>The Minister is committed to significantly improving health care for all children in Ireland.  We have already taken enormous strides to achieve this.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For example, an additional &euro;9 million has been provided to the HSE in its 2018 budget allocation, specifically to develop paediatric orthopaedic services, including further increasing access to scoliosis services.  As Members will know, the project to develop the new children&rsquo;s hospital is an extraordinary opportunity to enhance paediatric services for children.  Indeed, part of the rationale for the development of the new children&rsquo;s hospital was to address the existing physical infrastructure across the three children&rsquo;s hospitals in the group.  There is limited ability to increase bed capacity in the existing hospitals between now and the opening of the new hospital.  The design of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and two outpatient and urgent care centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly Hospital was based on a thorough analysis of capacity and demand, and is in line with best practice.<\/p><p>The new children&rsquo;s hospital is due to be completed in 2022.  This will be preceded by the opening of the centres in Connolly and Tallaght hospitals in 2019 and 2020 to provide consultant-led urgent care and secondary outpatient services, including rapid access general paediatric clinics.  Each centre is projected to deal with 25,000 urgent care and 15,000 outpatient attendances annually, resulting in a significant improvement in access to services.  Overall, the new facilities are expected to provide an increase in capacity of 16% for inpatients, 26% for day cases, 47% for outpatient attendances and 7% for emergency department, ED, attendances.  My Department is also progressing the Children&rsquo;s Health Bill 2018 to establish a single body to govern and manage paediatric services across the three hospitals in Dublin in advance of the move to the new facilities.  A clinical integration strategy has been developed to integrate the clinical services across the hospital in advance of the move and to ensure a smooth transition to the new facilities.  There will be significant advantages to having integrated clinical and non-clinical services across the existing sites, one of which is the introduction of a central referrals system for all patients requiring paediatric services to maximise available capacity.  The transition of staff and services to the new children&rsquo;s hospital will ultimately mean that all specialist services will be provided under one roof, tri-located with adult acute facilities.<\/p><p>I thank the Senator.

I have discussed this issue at length in this House.  We know that the real issue is the lack of supply.  I call once again for a State-wide social housing construction programme like the one in the years after the foundation of this State.  I am familiar with an estate in my own local area, called the Tenters.  This estate was one of the first social housing programmes built by the first Irish Government.  These houses are almost 100 years old and are considered some of the finest homes in the city.  We need to look back at what we were able to do in the past with little or no capital budgets.<\/p><p>We now have 9,000 people living in emergency accommodation and there are 85,000 people on social housing lists yet we do not seem to have any solution.  There seems to be no urgency on this huge issue.  House prices are increasing weekly and there is a lack of supply.  Young couples cannot afford to save at the same rate that the house prices are increasing.  I do not trust Rebuilding Ireland.  We need to see local authorities or some State arm taking control and building the houses we urgently need. <\/p><p>I also wish to raise the matter of Versatis pain relieving patches.  Like many Senators, I have received many calls to my office by people who have been denied affordable access to these patches on either the drugs payment scheme or the medical card.  These people are vulnerable and often bedridden with excruciating pain.  They do not have the strength or energy to attend and protest outside Leinster House like other groups.  Fortunately, through \"Liveline\", RT&Eacute; has given these vulnerable people a platform to air their grievance.  They have been unfairly targeted in an effort by the HSE to shave money off the drugs budget.  It is one of the cruellest acts of this Government and shows its contempt and disregard for those on the margins who do not have a strong voice.  I call on the Minister to attend the House to explain the rationale for culling the budget for Versatis patches and call on him to direct his staff to reinstate the patches on the drug refund and medical card schemes without delay.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021300002#N00400","speaker":"1407","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518532200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I want to raise three issues.

It is important that we have a strong, robust and independent electoral commission.  It makes sense.  We need to increase voter participation and promote engagement in the process.  We need to put in place a formal structure for the registration of political parties, regulate political funding and electoral expenditure and oversee the forthcoming referendum commission.  There is always controversy when there is a referendum.  There are also controversies over the up to date registers of electors.  There are local authorities which are not actively and meaningfully going out and doing fieldwork, and door-to-door calls to get people on the register.  Some people find they have been taken off the register without any request having been made on the matter.  There are various issues around this.

The Leader will be familiar with the case of Emma De Souza whose battle to assert her Irish citizenship rights has gained wide coverage on various media platforms, North and South, not least in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, because I have raised it previously.  Emma De Souza is an Irish citizen from Magherafelt.  She currently lives in Belfast with her husband, Jake.  The reason this has become such an issue for them and they have faced such an arduous battle to uphold and protect the most basic of democratic rights is when Emma applied for a permanent residency visa for her husband, the British Home Office told her that in order for her to assert her Irish citizenship, she had to renounce British citizenship because it was presumed that since she was born in the North, she is automatically a British citizen.  Emma contests this and says that, under the Good Friday Agreement, her rights as an Irish citizen solely are clear.  At three various tribunal hearings in Belfast's High Court, that position was supported and endorsed by judges.<\/p><p>The British Home Office is appealing the decision for a third time.  I do not know whether Home Office officials who deal with such visa applications are ignorant of the contents, principles and legislation flowing from the Good Friday Agreement or whether something more sinister is at play.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should meet Emma to hear her story and they should act as champions not just on her behalf in this case, but on behalf of all those who find themselves in a similar position.  The agreement is clear.  We are not partial or conditional citizens and we certainly should not be second-class citizens.  It would send a positive message in concert and in tune with recent statements from An Taoiseach and his Government colleagues that they will not abandon Irish citizens in the North.  That is the right and proper stand to take.  Will the Leader relay that message to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and ask that they respond to my request to meet Emma as soon as possible?<\/p><p>I refer to the launch of the new Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade dedicated website on Brexit.  That is a welcome resource, which I am sure will be utilised extensively given the uncertainty relating to Brexit in the context of the agreement, citizenship rights, the Border, economic and other implications.  Given the extensive nature of Brexit's negative implications, I call on the Government to consider a dedicated facility in the North of Ireland that would be rights-based in its service delivery and act as a support for citizens who will be trapped or held hostage in a post-Brexit scenario against their will.  To be fair to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, he stated at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement that he would examine this issue.<\/p><p>The trial of Ahed Tamimi began in an Israeli military court earlier.

We need a legislative response, not simply the maintenance of a code of practice that was introduced in 2007 and is no longer fit for purpose.  We need that code of practice encapsulated in our statute law.  This Bill intends to do that and it also intends to ensure that those who are depriving the State of the tax and PRSI revenue owed to the State through the misclassification of somebody's categorisation should be treated for what they are - tax cheats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021300002#P00300","speaker":"1398","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518532200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for their help over the last three weeks.

Some of these changes have come about in the past 12 months in regard to PRSI payable by councillors and it is now equal to that paid by the self-employed.  However, this is of little or no benefit to the majority of councillors.  The additional &euro;1,000 provided to recognise the additional workload which has arisen as a result of the creation of municipal districts has not been added to the expenses of councillors, even though these are expenses, but has been added to the representational allowance, which is subject to income tax and PRSI.  The option for councillors of &euro;5,000 of vouched expenses is so restrictive that fewer than 3% have opted for this.  Another measure introduced last year changed the payment rates for mileage and introduced a banding system on a par with the rest of the public sector.  These bands and rates were agreed by the public sector unions and representatives of the Government without any input from those who represent local authority members.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> As a trade unionist, the Leader knows it is a fundamental of any negotiations on public sector pay and conditions that the people affected are represented at such negotiations.  This courtesy was not afforded to local authority members through either the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, or the Local Authority Members' Association, LAMA.  These bands have led to the introduction of a requirement for aggregation of travel claims by members of local authorities across the various bodies on which they represent the public - not themselves but the public.  The Oireachtas has placed an obligation on local authorities to nominate members to serve on the education and training boards, the regional assemblies, the governing authorities of various third level institutions and many other bodies.  We are now requiring councillors and their parent local authorities to administer an extraordinarily convoluted system for the payment of a pittance to local authority members to cover their travel expenses.  Officials in Departments and local authorities will have no difficulty with the systems because their pay and expenses are administered by their employers.  However, the nature of membership of a local authority is that significant travel is involved and is payable from multiple authorities for the various activities in which we require our county councillors and city councillors to engage.  Furthermore, the rates specified in the Department circular are Revenue-approved rates.  This calls into question whether county councillors now have an obligation to aggregate the travel and subsistence payable to them in their work as a members of a local authority and the various public bodies on which they serve with any travel and subsistence they may receive in their private employment in order to remain tax compliant.<\/p><p>As a result of these changes, some members have become disadvantaged financially.  This new system of travelling expenses has caused huge difficulties for rural councillors in particular.  There are councillors in rural Ireland who represent very rural constituencies and, in some instances, island communities who are losing up to &euro;4,500 or &euro;5,000 for doing their job.  This is not acceptable.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister of State with responsibility for local government, in particular local government reform and the pay and conditions of our local authority members, come before the House.<\/p><p>Finally, special recognition needs to be given to the unique status of the role of the local elected member within the local government system.  The possibility of a dedicated travel rates system applicable to local authority members only, in recognition of their unique role within local government, needs to be looked at.  No elected member can be allowed to be worse off due to these new regulations anymore.  I am putting the House on notice, on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, that we will not tolerate this.  This is why I propose an amendment to the Order of the Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021300002#Q00300","speaker":"1418","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518532200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I call Senator Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021300002#R00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1518532200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>In 2012, the House passed a law, which I, as the then Minister for Health, brought through the House and which was heavily sponsored by Senator Bacik.

To be absolutely clear, male circumcision is a medical procedure; female circumcision is genital mutilation.  \"Female circumcision\" is not a medical term; it is a cultural term and a cultural procedure.

FGM is a heinous act that has been outlawed in this country by my Bill, which I am very proud to have brought into this House and have passed.  Furthermore, it is illegal, lest there be any doubt, for anyone in this country to take a woman or a child out of this country for the purpose of performing such procedures elsewhere.

One is the outrageous move by the Department of Education and Skills to place a cap for some reason on the enrolment of five Educate Together primary schools across the country.  I have been contacted by a number of parents and local representatives in New Ross, Tramore, Trim, Castlebar and Tuam, all of whom are perplexed as to why the Department has decided to place a 13 student cap on the enrolment numbers for next September for each of these Educate Together schools.  It is quite surprising considering that in the last number of years there was a large roll-out of Educate Together schools across the country under the former Ministers, Ruair&iacute; Quinn and Jan O'Sullivan.  Plebiscites were held in most parts of the country to find out, for the first time, the type of patronage model that interested most parents and much to the surprise of some, although not to people in the Labour Party, many parents were interested in the multi-denominational model.  A number of schools were subsequently established.  However, now the schools in New Ross, Tramore, Trim, Castlebar and Tuam are being told they can only take in 13 pupils from September.  I wonder if there is some type of institutional bias in the Department against these schools because no other patronage schools are being asked to put a cap on their numbers.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate in the Seanad with the Minister for Education and Skills on this important issue.  A number of parents are quite disturbed by this development.<\/p> <p>Second, I wish to raise the Children's Rights Alliance Report Card 2018.  To be fair, and I try to be fair in my deliberations here, many of the grades the Children's Rights Alliance has given the Government have improved from last year.  That should be acknowledged.  However, two issues arise from the report and it would be interesting to invite the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to the House to discuss them.  One is child and family homelessness, for which a grade E has been given by the Children's Rights Alliance.  There are many grades to show that the Government is clearly delivering, which is commendable, but on the issue of child homelessness it is an E grade for the second year in a row from the Children's Rights Alliance, which is a reputable organisation.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should be invited to the House to discuss that.<\/p> <p>The second issue in the report is general practitioner, GP, care for children.  The last Government introduced free GP care for every child in the Republic under six years of age and we expected that it would be extended to every child under 12 years of age within a short period of time.  Now the Minister is talking about a flat fee of perhaps &euro;5 or &euro;10 for every visit, which we would flatly oppose.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the Leader would respond on those three issues; the roll-out of free GP care for children between six and 12 years of age; the issue of child and family homelessness; and the pertinent issue of the day, the crazy cap that has been placed on enrolment in Educate Together schools in five areas of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021300002#T00200","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1518532200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I second Senator Wilson's proposed amendment to the Order of Business.

The system is very cumbersome.<\/p><p>If a councillor is on an education and training board, a regional assembly, a health forum or a member of the AILG, the mileage rate changes over mileage terms.  It means one has to seek different rates from the different authorities and account for all of this.  Let us remember that a councillor is effectively a one person operation.  Councillors answer their own phone calls and respond to emails.  They do not have secretarial support, funded or otherwise, and if they do it is out of their own pocket.  It is very important that we acknowledge the work they do.<\/p><p>The vast major of local authority members serve their community and are not in the role for the money.  Very few people will get involved with the level of work required for &euro;16,000 a year and a modest level of expenses.  Why are members of the local authorities the only people in the entire public service who do not get a pension at the end of their service?  If one does ten hours work a week in a part-time position for a number of years in a local authority, that service in pensionable.  One will have a very small pension based on a very small salary.  Councillors' pensions would not be expensive because they are not earning a lot of money to start with. <\/p><p>It is important that we acknowledge that people are contributing.  Some councillors are serving since 1967, some since 1974, and others were elected more recently.  They are not there for the money but should be entitled to a pension based on their years of service over many years.  Councillors give up hours, weekends and evenings week in, week out to go to various functions and residents' meetings.  They are not compensated in any way for those things and they go because they want to go.  We should not leave people out of pocket.  I came from a meeting with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, about public sector reform.  He knows of a local authority that only has one ratepayer.

I know there are councillors in the Gallery and I welcome those present.  Some councillors from west Cork, the Cathaoirleach's constituency, are present.  By the time they leave County Cork they are half way to Dublin and that is the extent of the travel they have to do.  From Bantry in west Cork to Cork County Hall is not a short trip.

That breaks down to &euro;318.56 per week and it is subject to PAYE, PRSI and USC.  If one takes the gross figure of &euro;318.56, and assumes that the average councillor works 40 hours a week, it comes to &euro;7.90 per hour.  Most of the time these hours will be unsociable - weekends and evenings.  Speaking to and knowing many councillors, I know that they work far in excess of 40 hours per week.

The company management indicated that the potential job losses are due to Brexit and the resultant weakness of sterling.  The loss of 31 jobs would be a huge blow to a town such as Carrickmacross, as all Senators will appreciate.  It is even more worrying that the potential losses are in the food sector, which is vitally important to a county such as Monaghan because so many jobs in sectors such as mushrooms, poultry and general agriculture are dependent on it.<\/p> <p>This should not be happening under the nose of the Government.

People will be aware that there is a clean livestock policy whereby animals being presented for slaughter in abattoirs and processing plants need to be presented in a relatively clean fashion or they will be categorised and may not be allowed into the food chain because of the possibility of contamination of the meat.  The clean sheep policy was only introduced in recent weeks.  In the week gone by there has been unbelievable confusion about the interpretation of this policy.  There is no consideration being taken of the fact that the majority of sheep, unlike cattle, are finished and fattened outside in the pastures.  With the wet year we have had, it is almost impossible to have them to the standards that are being expected.<\/p> <p>The Minister needs to intervene immediately.  Kepak stopped slaughter of lambs during the week and is sending home the vast majority of the sheep that are presented.

Let me reassure Senator Humphreys that the party I belong to and represent wants to see all working families housed and in their own homes, or in houses provided by local authorities under the social housing building scheme.  The <i>Daft.ie <\/i>report from today is, as Government has said, a reminder that we have challenges to face in the housing sector.  We must have an honest debate around housing as well.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, and the Taoiseach are committed to the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  In the city and county of Cork, where I live, we can see the hoardings of Rebuilding Ireland and the bricks and mortar being used at key sites.  We have to increase supply, and we have to get the balance between landlords and social housing correct.  <br\/><br\/>I accept there are challenges to be met, but the Government has prioritised Rebuilding Ireland and the funding and construction of social housing and has provided incentives to keep landlords as part of the construction and housing model.  There are some people in this House who do not want any landlords involved in social housing and some who do not want any private developer building, but would prefer all housing to be under State control.  We need an amalgam of all of these options, and that is why the Government has committed to Rebuilding Ireland.  It has prioritised a range of measures under that programme, including the rent pressure zones.  The <i>Daft.ie<\/i>report does not cover the whole year.  Rents in some places have not exponentially increased.  In some parts of the country, where we have colleges and universities, we have seen an increase in the building of student accommodation.  When Fianna F&aacute;il was in Government, it did not make it obligatory for colleges to provide student accommodation; it was left to the individual or the private landlord sector to do that.  Let us have a real, honest debate about housing.  Senators should not come in here every day and politicise the issue.  I accept that meeting the housing need is challenging, but let us work on it in a collective manner, rather than criticising the Government for doing nothing at all.  The Government is doing something about this problem.  That is a fact.  The guidelines the Residential Tenancies Board has put forward and the changes that have been made show that there are pressures, but the pressures will be met by increasing supply.  <br\/><br\/>I agree with Senator Ardagh and Senator Colm Burke regarding the versatis drug.  I heard the remarks of the chief executive of the HSE at the Joint Committee on Health where he said at one level that there was no change, but then we saw the change happening.  It affects a very small number of people.  The important point is that there are other equivalent medications available that can be taken, but Senator Ardagh and Senator Colm Burke rightly say that it is important to ensure that the cohort of people who require this important drug are able to get it.  It is important, and it is incumbent on the HSE and the Minister to come together to ensure this drug is available.  I also believe that if the company which manufactures the drug was to consider reducing the cost, it might become more readily available.  That is an argument we must have in terms of how the prices in our drugs basket are continually monitored.  The Minister should come to the House for that debate.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the electoral commission.  It is part of the programme for Government.  He also raised the issue of Rebuilding Ireland.  It is important to recognise that as part of the programme for Government there is a commitment to include a new commission to examine the whole operation of our electoral system.  Many of us who have spoken on this issue in the past would welcome the appointment of an independent electoral commission to oversee the operations of our elections.  It is not just about political parties being registered, or about funding, but the role of politics and how it operates in our country.  We should all welcome that.  I would be happy to invite the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, to the House to discuss the matter raised by Senator Boyhan.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will let him speak tomorrow on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016. <\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has raised the matter of Ms Emma de Souza.

This is a fundamental question for the body politic.  While Senator Boyhan spoke about the importance of the Electoral Commission, I am firmly of the view, having been a member, that the role of the local authority is the central role in our system of politics.  Senators Wilson and O'Donnell are right.  As Senator McFadden said, it is important to place a value on the role of local representatives at local authority level.  I do not just mean a monetary value, though that is important, but a real political value.  What they do on a daily basis, and on a statutory basis, underpins the importance of what we will see on Friday with the national development plan and the publication, examination and scrutiny of county development plans.  The work that they do is important.  In this House, we fundamentally agree that what we are all trying to achieve is to have the pay and conditions for councillors that are called for in Senator Wilson's motion accepted by the Government and implemented.  <\/p> <p>I will not go over the debate around this part of the Order of Business other than to agree that the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, will come to the House next week.  He is not available this week.  He will find consensus and agreement within the Fine Gael Party.  We have been working with him, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I know that the Fine Gael councillors' representative group has met with Deputy Phelan, and last week met with the Minister for Finance and the T&aacute;naiste.  <\/p> <p>As the Cathaoirleach said in his introduction to my reply, it is fundamentally wrong that someone from the Mizen Peninsula, Castletownbere or Bantry who is a dedicated member of a local authority serving on several boards, such as the education and training board, the strategic policy committee, SPC, or whatever, should be out of pocket for the expenses of travelling to do the duty he or she has been elected to do.  Equally, it is wrong for people to have to serve on an interview panel without being facilitated by pay and conditions that constitute fair remuneration.  As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, no other person would be put in that position.  I believe that as a body politic we must stand up for ourselves.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the past we did not do so, such as when Fianna F&aacute;il, with Brian Lenihan as Minister, cut expenses and allowances.

I am sure this House strongly supports the overarching objective of the NBP to provide this basic necessity to every premises in Ireland.  It is a vital utility that is fundamental to sectors, including business, education and agriculture, and a key element for social and economic development.<\/p> <p>Senators will no doubt be aware of the recent D&aacute;il debates and media coverage on the NBP arising from Eir's decision to withdraw from the procurement process.  They will have received copies of all the relevant correspondence and comprehensive briefing documents.  I would like to reaffirm today that the NBP remains a top priority of Government and a personal commitment from me to put every placename in every county on the digital map.  The NBP procurement team and I are confident that the process can continue and will achieve an outcome that will deliver high-speed broadband throughout Ireland as efficiently as possible.<\/p> <p>While at this point the NBP procurement team has a single bidder following the withdrawal of two bidders for commercial reasons, the remaining consortium led by SSE-Enet is an experienced consortium with international expertise.  It has already identified its final issues for discussion with the Department's team and this list was submitted some weeks ago while competition remained in the process.  <\/p> <p>A narrative that has emerged is that the procurement process is overly-onerous and complex.  Of course, this is an onerous and complex process as we will be spending hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money to deliver a future-proofed, high-speed broadband network throughout the country.<\/p> <p>The competitive dialogue procurement procedure which we are using is common practice internationally for projects of this nature and complexity.  It enables, not inhibits, greater participation throughout the process.  The procurement process opens up a dialogue with selected candidates in order to identify and define the means best suited to deliver a national broadband plan.  It is important to point out that a bidder cannot go backwards on matters.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Denis Naughten:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The competitive dialogue procedure was also used for the procurement of the next generation broadband project in Northern Ireland and the BDUK superfast broadband project in Oxfordshire, and is used for public private partnerships in Ireland.<\/p><p>I understand the frustration of people who are watching the procurement process and waiting for it to conclude but who, in the meantime, are left without access to high-speed broadband, and I thank them for their patience.  I can assure Members that I will not let this procurement process continue for one minute longer than is absolutely necessary.  As the procurement process proceeds through the final stages, I will ensure that this House and its Members are regularly updated on the progress in delivering the objectives of the national broadband plan.<\/p><p>The State-led intervention and its procurement process is one element of the multifaceted national broadband plan working together to deliver a digital Ireland.  The plan aims not just to intervene in the market but also stimulate commercial investment.  To date, commercial investment of &euro;2 million is continuing to deliver improved broadband services every single day, reducing Ireland's digital divide.  That increased level of investment by commercial operators certainly has been influenced by the commitments outlined in the national broadband plan.<\/p><p>When I first took office, just over five in every ten premises had broadband.  At the end of last year, that was nearly seven in every ten and, by the end of 2018, it will be nearly eight in every ten.  By the end of 2018, it is envisaged that 79% of the population, 87% of schools and 96% of business parks will have access to high-speed broadband.  In the past 12 months alone, new telecommunications infrastructure has been delivered to over 280,000 premises providing high-speed broadband services of up to 1 Gbit per second download speeds.  In addition, the Eir rural 300,000 roll-out will deliver high-speed broadband to 810,000 people, one third of farms in the country and over 1,000 schools by the end of this year.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the increase in commercial investment is of little solace to the 990,000 or so citizens who will not be served by those commercial operators.  However, the State intervention and the procurement process will provide those citizens with high-speed broadband access, regardless of location, and that will be future proofed for the next 25 years.<\/p><p>The intervention area will provide broadband to: 542,000 postal addresses; 990,000 citizens or 21% of the population; 381,000 members of the labour force; 52,057 farms or 61% of the total number of farms; 47,096 small and medium businesses, primarily micro-business; 437 or 13% of schools; and 310 business parks or 4% of the national total of business parks.<\/p><p>Significant progress is also being made across a number of areas to ensure efficient and effective delivery of the national broadband plan.  I established the mobile phone and broadband task force in July 2016 in line with a commitment I had written into A Programme for A Partnership Government.  The task force identifies solutions to potential obstacles faced by the roll out of the national broadband plan and aims to facilitate faster delivery of mobile and wireless broadband solutions across rural Ireland.  In fact, the actions taken through the task force report will lead in the coming weeks to very significant announcements by both wireless and mobile operators who are looking to expand the network of broadband services across rural Ireland in the very short term.  The task force's annual report will be published shortly and will identify the significant achievements made to date, including the positive impact of the broadband officers operating in each county and local authority.<\/p><p>In addition, there are other initiatives under way to maximise and enhance existing connectivity.  For example, the release of the 3.6 GHz 5G capable spectrum in May 2017 will enable operators to provide faster fixed wireless and mobile services to customers and, as I said, I expect significant announcements on that in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021300002#DD01800","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518532200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
