There are difficulties in the beef market, particularly in the case of bull beef.  We need to consider and are considering alternative outlets for farmers to try to ensure they get full value for their animals.  I am aware of the difficulties being experienced in the beef sector by farmers with regard to certain categories of animals.  However, exports of live cattle were up by some 25% in 2013 and from the start of this year to 9 March, the total live export figure stood at 41,943.  Indications from live animal exporters are that the higher level of live exports will continue.  Live export volumes were further boosted by a recent shipment of 2,500 bulls to Libya.  The medium-term effect of the increased live exports will be a reduction in the availability of cattle for slaughtering later in the year and into next year and this should result in higher cattle prices for farmers.<\/p><p>  Since my appointment as Minister, I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding international markets for dairy, beef and lamb products, with a view to raising the profile of Ireland and increasing international confidence in Irish production and control systems.  My aim is to provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in these sectors, particularly in new and emerging markets to which I have led trade missions, including China, the United States, Japan, Algeria and the Gulf states in the Middle East.  Moreover, there is ongoing close collaboration between my Department, Bord Bia and Irish embassies on improving market access and these initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing access to Irish beef from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran.  As recently as January, Lebanon agreed to reopen its market to Irish beef, sheepmeat and cooked meats.  We are making very good progress in gaining access to the US market which will be very valuable.  There is a formal working group, including the Chinese authorities, with a view to trying to gain access to the Chinese market.  This work will take a little time.  A considerable effort is rightly being made in my Department to try to seek new outlets for Irish meat.  Let us not forget that as we export nearly 90% of all beef we produce, we must constantly find and develop new markets, including markets for live exports, particularly at a time when there is clearly an oversupply of a certain category of beef, namely, bull beef, in Ireland.  That oversupply will last only for another couple of weeks, after which I hope we will see a normalisation of prices.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>  With regard to the live cattle export trade, I am very conscious that this trade, whether to other EU member states or third countries, serves a dual purpose in stimulating price competition for domestic cattle and satisfying a real demand in overseas markets for specific types of animal.  It thus complements the processing beef trade by providing alternative market outlets, thereby underpinning the meat and livestock industry generally.<\/p><p>  My Department, in co-operation with Bord Bia and Irish embassies, will continue to support actively the development of both the live export trade and beef trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600004#B01400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1395826800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply.

Furthermore, there is a problem with processors' cartels operating.  They are able to manipulate the market.  An overlapping question concerns the fact that if there is a cartel operating that is manipulating and controlling prices in the market, there is a lack of live exports that would otherwise help to put pressure on the cartels to give market value to the farmer and producer.

There is a balance to be struck.  Live exports are important to keep the factories honest, as farmers would put it, and provide competition to influence prices here, but we should still be trying to find a way to try to obtain the best price possible and slaughter as many animals as we can in Ireland in order to keep the processing and added-value jobs here.<\/p><p>  We are working on trying to open new markets.  Last year we worked very hard to try to get shipments to Libya for the first time in many years.  This involves a ship-certification process.  My Department has been working on prioritising this issue.  We set very high standards, however, in terms of the quality of ships allowed to transport live animals.  This is because we live on an island and realise ships carrying animals to north Africa, for example, must cross the Bay of Biscay in the middle of winter.  It is a rough sea at the best of times.

Rather, there must be persistent serious infringements leading to an accumulation of a certain number of points before any suspension will occur.  The accumulation of points for persistent serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy will lead to the suspension of a sea-fishing boat licence for a period from two months to one year.  In extreme cases, persistent serious fisheries infringements could lead to the permanent withdrawal of a licence.  It should also be noted that provision is made in the statutory instrument for a robust and effective appeals process.  Therefore, a licence holder may apply to an independent appeals officer against any proposal to apply points to him or her.  I have already appointed an Appeals Officer in accordance with the provisions of the statutory instrument.  The statutory instrument also makes provision for appeal on a point of law to the High Court in respect of the decision of an appeals officer.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy's question is whether points continue to apply following the taking of a legal case which is lost.  The answer to that question is &quot;Yes, they do,&quot; in the same way that there is a difference between a civil and criminal case in a court of law.  It is akin to a person receiving penalty points having been caught driving too fast.  However, those concerned may appeal the penalty points to an appeals officer and the High Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600005#C00600","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1395827400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600005#C00800","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1395827400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The levels of burden of proof in a criminal case versus this particular statutory instrument are different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600005#C00900","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1395827400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I must ask Deputies to adhere to the time allowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600005#C01000","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1395827400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>The Minister is trying to make the case that there is a difference between this penalty points system and criminal proceedings.

The Commission regulation and Council regulation are silent on this matter.  There is no reference in either of those regulations to any national proceedings affecting the penalty points system.

It was made clear to me, under a point of law, that what we are dealing with in this regard is two parallel systems.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, will apply penalty points in respect of breaches of the rules.  While in this regard a particularly high burden of proof will not be required, proof will be required before points can apply.  Those awarded penalty points will have an opportunity to appeal, which is an entirely separate system from going to court.  Where a legal criminal case is taken against a skipper or owner of a boat in respect of infringement of the rules, the burden of proof and punishment is much higher.  It is a separate system.  We cannot, I am told, in law overlap the two systems.  They are different systems in terms of the burden of proof and punishments involved.  The penalty points system is aimed at being a deterrent, one that is equal in respect of everybody across the European Union.  The two systems need to remain separate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600005#C01200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1395827400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>This section was described recently by the SFPA at a committee meeting as a novel approach.

For obvious reasons it is neither appropriate nor possible for me to intervene directly in setting prices.  My Department monitors the kill figures from Irish meat plants and I note that slaughterings of bull beef in the first 11 weeks of 2014, up to 16 March, stood at almost 65,000.  That represented an increase of almost 2,000, or 3%, on the figure for the same period last year.  In addition, as I outlined, the number of live cattle exported to the end of 9 March was approximately 42,000, up 6% on the figure for last year.  <\/p><p>  It should be noted that Irish beef prices were 106% of European Union average last year.  The average price change in the first ten weeks of this year is a reduction of approximately 1.8%, but it must be remembered that that is a common price that has decreased slightly in the first quarter of the year.  Nonetheless, I know and recognise that there is a specific problem in the bull beef sector.  Essentially, there is an oversupply of a certain product, which is very much out of spec in terms of what supermarkets are seeking.  That is a problem and it has resulted in prices falling well below what farmers would have been expecting to receive for their bull beef.<\/p><p>  I have tried to do everything within reason to speak to both the farming organisations and the processing sector.  I have ongoing conversations with retailers on a range of issues, including the spec they are seeking.  The problem is that if one is producing large animals, bull beef that is 22, 24 and 26 months old, often steaks from these animals are far too big in terms of what retail outlets want.  That is the reason retail outlets, particularly those in the United Kingdom, sourcing bull beef are looking for animals aged 16 or 17 months, which in general we are not producing here.  We need to learn lessons from this, both at a processing and a farming level, to produce what the market is looking for to make sure we get the maximum price for what we are producing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600006#D00100","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1395828000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>First, the Minister is probably familiar with the Derrypatrick project and the understanding of farmers that processors, Teagasc and everybody else involved in the project were encouraging them to produce 18 month old bull beef because it was not economical to produce it at the age of 16 months.

On whether farmers were advised badly, I have never advocated a significant increase in the production of bull beef in Ireland.  On all of the trade missions I have undertaken, particularly in the markets in which we sell beef in Europe, including the United Kingdom, people have been telling me since I became Minister that they want marbled beef, steer cattle primarily and heifers as opposed to bull beef.  Many farmers made the economic decision to go down the route of producing bull beef because it suited their systems.  They might have less land and may want to keep their animals inside for slightly longer.  They will feed them more meal than they would otherwise do if they were grazing them using a grass-based system.  This suits some farm structures.  The problem is that 20% of our beef is now bull beef and the market is indicating that it wants something different.  I still believe it is economically viable to produce bull beef, but if a farmer is producing young bull beef using a predominantly grass-based system, it is impossible to produce, as the Deputy states, 16 month old bull beef.  Farmers have to make a choice to either intensively produce bull beef, using high protein meal, or to produce it using a grazing system, supplemented with meal.  What needs to happen is a conversation between farmers who want to produce bull beef and the factories they will be supplying to ensure everybody is clear on what will be provided.  The farmers who have done this have got a good price for their bull beef animals.  The problem has been encountered by farmers who have produced animals without a pre-contract agreement with factories.  They bring an animal approximately 22 months old to a factory-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600006#D01100","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1395828000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I am sorry, Minister, but we are over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600006#D01600","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1395828000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>-----but there is no market outlet for that animal.

There is different ownership here.  People talk all of the time about some kind of cartel operating in the beef industry but all I can say, based on my own experience, is that there is a lot of competition between the various beef companies.  Companies like Dawn Meats, Kepak, ABP and so forth are in intensive competition with each other in terms of the markets they supply.  There is also a host of other, smaller companies involved in the industry such as Kildare Chilling, Slaney Meats and so forth.  We produce a lot of meat in Ireland, far more than our own market could support.  We export huge volumes of meat and companies have been built on the back of those exports.  I believe there is competition in the industry, although that might not be a popular thing to say.  If there is any evidence to suggest that anything else is occurring in the marketplace, I would like to hear about it and will follow up on it.<\/p><p>  I do not think we should put a beef regulator in place, independent of the Government, because that would suggest that there is something seriously wrong here.

If there is any evidence to suggest that there is something fundamentally wrong in terms of the structures or dominance within the market, the Competition Authority can investigate that.  Let us not start raising concerns about the industry here without having some evidence to back them up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600009#G00800","speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Communities","time":1395829800,"counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600009#G00850"},{"type":"question","time":1395829800,"counter":141,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[13223\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600009#G00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason the scheme of assistance for pot fishermen is capped at 50 pots for boats under 12 metres, rather than 100 pots as is the case for 12 to 15 metre boats in view of the fact that the vast majority of vessels affected by recent events are under 10 metres in length; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1395829800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>My question refers to the fact that the smaller fishermen who work from the coastline out to the six-mile limit are being penalised because their boats are too small, which seems unfair, given that they are in most need of the Minister's help.

I asked BIM to put together a scheme that could help inshore fishermen who have lost lobster pots, crab pots and so on.  The intention was that the Department would pay 40% of the replacement costs.  BIM representatives came back to me with a proposal.  They asked me how much money was available and I told them the budget was &euro;1.5 million.  I am not getting any extra money from the Exchequer for this but have to take money from other areas in my Department, unlike the situation with the piers and harbours fund, for which we are getting money through a Supplementary Estimate.  At the moment, we are committing &euro;1.5 million to this sector.  We then had to try to prioritise within the sector.  BIM made the straightforward recommendation that generally bigger boats have more pots.  That is why we said that we would limit the aid to 50 pots for boats under 12 m and 100 pots for vessels under 15 m, which I thought was reasonable.  However, when we go through the initial application of this scheme, if we have not spent the full amount we will look at reallocating the remaining funds in certain cases.<\/p><p>It is too early to say if that will happen, but we have committed to a certain scheme.

He dedicated his career to the fight against crime and has a record of which he can justly be proud.  I express my sincere thanks to him for his commitment and service to the State.<\/p><p>  In its statement yesterday the Government indicated that information had come to light indicating that a system for the recording of telephone calls to and from many Garda stations had been in place for many years before it was discontinued last November.  The fact that such a system was in place, and for so long, is clearly a matter of serious concern which the Government believes warrants the establishment of a commission of investigation.  The circumstances surrounding the establishment of this system of recording, exactly when it started, the number of Garda stations involved, the extent to which recordings were retained and their relevance to any Garda investigation are still unclear.  One of the main functions of the commission of investigation will be to establish the facts relating to these and all other relevant issues.  I recognise, of course, that Deputies will have many reasonable questions on these and other aspects of the matter, but I am greatly constrained in what I can say.  We need to establish the facts before we can draw firm conclusions and it would be wrong to engage in speculation in advance of this.  However, I will outline what I know from a letter by the outgoing Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan.  The letter was sent to my Department on 10 March and made under section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 which provides a mechanism for the submission of information by the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, this letter was not furnished to me by my officials until approximately 12.40 p.m. yesterday and I did not have an opportunity to read and consider it until some time later.<\/p><p> The letter started off by referring, by way of background, to a case in which civil proceedings are being taken by two persons against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the State for wrongful arrest and related matters.  I am aware of speculation on the identity of these proceedings, but the House will understand that I cannot comment on proceedings currently before the courts.  The letter from the Garda Commissioner referred to recordings of telephone conversations into and out of a particular Garda station, which had come to light as part of the process of discovering documents of relevance to the plaintiffs.  That process is still under way.  Again, I must emphasise the constraints on commenting on a case which is currently being litigated in the courts.<\/p><p> I am advised that my departmental officials were made aware of recordings of relevance to the specific civil proceedings previously mentioned on 28 February by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor arising from its involvement in the response to the civil proceedings.  I am informed that what was at issue was the discovery of recordings in a specific Garda station, not a more general system of recording calls in Garda stations and that no reference to such general recording of calls was made at that time.<\/p><p> In this letter of 10 March, the Garda Commissioner went on to say that it had subsequently transpired that systems would appear to have been installed during the 1980s in Garda stations to allow for the recording of incoming and outgoing calls from designated extensions.  The Commissioner explained that the rationale behind this was the recording of Garda radio traffic to and from control rooms, 999 calls and the gathering of evidence around calls made to Garda stations regarding bomb threats and other code messages.  This practice had continued in some stations over the years, with the recordings being retained within each station and with the original recorders being replaced in the 1990s and again in 2008.  The letter states that the original recorders were replaced with dictaphone recorders during the 1990s - I do not know what specific year - and further replaced by what are referred to as NICE recorders, which I understand is a brand name, which were installed in 2008.<\/p><p> The Commissioner explained that he had consulted the Attorney General's office on the matter and expected that consultation with the office of the Data Protection Commissioner would be necessary, as well as further advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  However, he made clear in the letter that he had directed that the routine recording of non-999 calls to Garda stations should cease and he confirmed that all recordings, except those made on dedicated 999 lines, were fully stopped nationally on 27 November 2013.  In regard to the continued recording of 999 calls, which I think everyone would instinctively understand, the Commissioner, in his letter, explained that there was a legislative underpinning of such recording contained in an Act of 2007.  The Commissioner went on to say that he was awaiting written confirmation from each divisional officer that all audio recordings that had been stored at each divisional headquarters outside Dublin had been collected and were now stored securely at Garda headquarters.  The Commissioner noted that the total number of tapes collected at that stage was 2,485.<\/p><p> The issue the Commissioner identified in the letter was the action he should now take in regard to these recordings and he particularly referenced his role as data controller in respect of the recordings.  He stated that he had consulted the Attorney General's office on 11 November 2013 and established a working group to report to him on the issue.  He stated that he expected that consultation with the office of the Data Protection Commissioner would be necessary as well as further advice from the Attorney General.  While the Attorney General, in the context of the civil proceedings previously mentioned, was made aware of the existence of tapes and the possible existence of other tapes, I am advised that she had no knowledge at that time of the circumstances surrounding the making of tapes, the legal background to their being made, the content of such tapes or the number of such tapes.<\/p><p> I understand that on the day the letter from the Commissioner was received, there was a consultation held with the senior counsel representing the State in this case to discuss the issues arising.  I also understand that on the day after the receipt of the letter of 10 March in my Department, 11 March 2014, there was a follow-up meeting between the Garda Commissioner, officials of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Office of the Attorney General.  I am advised that the discussion covered the ongoing legal consultation in regard to the civil proceedings.  I also understand that the matters covered in the letter of 10 March were being considered by my departmental officials, in the context of the ongoing legal consultation in regard to the specific case in question.  I am informed that, subsequently, on 19 and 20 March 2014, Garda headquarters copied my Department with correspondence between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and both the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p><p> As Members of the House may be aware, I flew to Mexico to undertake my duties in respect of Government Ministers' St. Patrick's Day arrangements on 15 March and did not return until 21 March.  I was not briefed on this matter until approximately 6 p.m. on Monday, 24 March 2014 in the Department of Justice and Equality, and as previously stated, was first furnished with the letter of 10 March from the Garda Commissioner yesterday at approximately 12.40 p.m.  Following the initial briefing by my departmental officials, I met with both the Taoiseach and the Attorney General on Monday evening to discuss these matters.<\/p><p> I know there are reports that I knew of the system of recording in Garda stations last year, but this is not the case.  Reference has been made, for example, to a case investigated by GSOC of a member of the public who was assaulted by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Waterford.  GSOC, I have since learnt, reported on this on 16 June last year and made reference in its report to the recording of phone calls in Waterford Garda Station.  However, this was not a report to me or my Department, but a press release by GSOC and there was no indication or suggestion of any nationwide system of recording in Garda stations.  I am aware of various commentators referencing this short GSOC report in broadcast and print media since the Government's statement was published yesterday afternoon on this issue and they have questioned the truthfulness of the account given to date of these matters.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, we live in a world where, regardless of the issue, some commentators and Opposition Deputies, on first learning of an issue detailed by Government of which they were unaware, feel compelled to accuse those who make the issue known and seek to address it, of telling untruths or of some incompetence.  This is something of an industry, and with Members opposite it is a wearisome repetitive refrain----- <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600010#H01400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395831000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Give him a mirror.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600011#J00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1395831000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>-----followed by the usual dosage of contrived outrage, something we see again this morning.<\/p><p>  The simple truth is GSOC did not furnish the report mentioned to me and I am advised that it did not furnish it to my departmental officials nor bring it to the Department's attention.  GSOC, no doubt, can confirm this.  Because of the background to the GSOC report, GSOC had no obligation under the 2005 Act to furnish it to me, but did have a discretion to furnish it to any &quot;person that the Commission considers has a sufficient interest in the matter&quot;.  GSOC obviously did not regard this report as of sufficient importance to furnish it specifically to me or my Department, but issued it as a press release.  It also seems, from the checking my officials have been able to undertake to date, that no Deputy in this House regarded the publication of sufficient importance to table a D&aacute;il question on it, but I am open to correction on that because of the limited time available to check on that matter.<\/p><p>  It may be the case that no Member of the House read this report until yesterday or, if they did, they placed no importance on it.  In so far as it received any media coverage, it does not appear as if any member of the media regarded the report as of any major importance.  Again, I am open to correction.  This is understandable, as the report gives no insight into the extent of recordings made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, nor did GSOC determine it an issue worthy of further investigation.  GSOC could, if it wished, have initiated a public interest investigation into the matter under section 102(4) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2002.  Had it done so, it would also have had to notify me of such investigation under section 103(1)(b) of the Act, unless GSOC invoked section 103(2), but I cannot see how that subsection could be of relevance.

The administration of justice under the Minister's watch is in crisis and has been for a long time through a series of the Minister's actions, inaction and incompetence.  That makes the Minister unfit to continue to hold office.  We need to recap on the catalogue of events the Minister has overseen.  We had the completely bungled handling of the penalty points issue.  Were it not for the clear, independent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Minister would have proceeded along the line that there was no issue there.  He would have continued in that vein but for the fact that the independent constitutional office of the Comptroller and Auditor General did its work and reported coherently.<\/p><p>  We then had the issue on the alleged bugging of GSOC.  The Minister immediately moved to turn the potential victim of a scandal into a villain.  He put GSOC chairman Simon O'Brien into the dock.  He brought in an outside company to second-guess some of the work GSOC did.  That undermined GSOC's role, and people are aggrieved by that.  There was the ongoing treatment by the Minister and the Government of the whistleblowers.  Is it not the job of any government in a modern democracy to seek to protect the citizens and their good names, reputations, characters and integrity?  The Minister failed, and continues to fail, to do that.  He is not owning up to his responsibility.  Some of the other Cabinet Ministers, the Labour Party Ministers in particular and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, are living up to their responsibilities but the Minister, Deputy Shatter and the Taoiseach cannot bring themselves, as two of the most powerful people in the Cabinet, to do right by two decent citizens of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600012#K00800","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1395831600,"counter":176,"content":"<p>They are infallible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600012#K00900","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1395831600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>That is a sad day when it is the Government's job to protect its citizens in the first instance.  <\/p><p>  We then had the situation regarding the Garda confidential recipient and the scandal of his departure.  It has never been explained by the Minister or anybody else what exactly the former Garda confidential recipient, Mr. Oliver Connolly, was referring to in those taped transcripts.  That is very serious.  Mr. Connolly refuses to elaborate on it and the Minister has been offered many opportunities to elaborate on it but refuses to do so.  It is another chapter in the catalogue.<\/p><p>  Later today we will discuss the report of the Garda Inspectorate.  Before it was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas it was leaked.  This shows blatant disregard for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister had a row with the Judiciary.  Whom has he not fought with?  The Minister had to set up a special quango to mediate between himself and the Judiciary.  The Garda Commissioner resigned under the Minister's watch.  We thought we could come in here yesterday and have an opportunity to discuss the Garda Commissioner's resignation.  It does not happen any old day.  Yet there was no opportunity to discover it.  Now we have the mishandling of the fact that telephone recordings have been undertaken in Garda stations for many years.  Nobody is blaming the Minister for doing it, but people are blaming him for the mishandling of the fallout from it.<\/p><p>  Every issue turns into a calamity and a crisis.  Other people take the blame and responsibility, not the Minister.  Yesterday it was reasonable to expect that we would have come in here to discuss the issues regarding the Garda Commissioner and his premature departure.  Instead, the leaders of my party and Sinn F&eacute;in were summoned to meet the Taoiseach to be briefed on:<blockquote>A new and very serious issue relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The implications of this matter are potentially of such gravity that the Government has decided to set up a statutory commission of investigation into this matter of significant public concern.<\/blockquote>As yesterday unfolded, and as a series of events unravelled, it became clear that the Government knew about this for a long time.  Why was this just conveniently dropped in there yesterday?  The Minister and the Taoiseach must account for the departure of the Garda Commissioner and their treatment of the whistleblowers, yet this issue was dropped into the political mix yesterday when we know it was there for a long time.  The Minister and Taoiseach are getting caught up in their own web of spin and beginning to meet themselves on the way back.<\/p><p>  Are we to believe that the Minister did not know about the Garda station recordings until earlier this week?  Are we to believe the Attorney General did not inform the Minister at the Government about this until recently?  Are we to believe that the Department of Justice and Equality did not inform them?  If the answer to all those questions is &quot;yes&quot;, and we are to believe all that, it confirms clearly to us, the Opposition and the public that the Minister is presiding over an Administration that is driven completely by incompetence.<\/p><p>  The Minister is a great legal mind and is lauded and applauded for that.  He will know that ignorance of the law is no defence in any regard.  Ignorance of the facts and events in this instance is not a defence either.  While the party leaders were receiving the briefing yesterday, the facts of the Waterford case were in the public domain for weeks, months and years.  The Waterford case was one of the first high-profile prosecutions taken by GSOC following an investigation of a complaint in which serving members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were convicted and imprisoned.  It is not credible that the Minister did not know about it, that the Attorney General and the Minister's Department failed to inform him.<\/p><p>We can argue the rights and wrongs of whether the Minister should have been informed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, as the report was available on its website, but for the Minister to credibly state neither he nor his Department was aware of it just does not hold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600012#K01000","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395832200,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Where were the advisers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600013#L00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1395832200,"counter":180,"content":"<p>GSOC reported in 2013 and the Attorney General set up a working group in November of that year.

The Minister did not indicate why he was circumventing GSOC with regard to the policy on and practice of recording telephone calls in and out of Garda stations.  Under its enabling legislation GSOC has a remit under to allow it to review Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policies and practices, but the Minister conveniently seems to be bypassing that body.

The latest twist in the succession of scandals and crises that have emerged on the Minister's watch occurred yesterday.  We were told that the Government had only become aware that a system had been in place in a large number of Garda stations whereby incoming and outgoing telephone calls were illegally recorded.  The Government stated it was \"extremely concerned about this information.\"  Consequently, it decided to do what thus far it has refused to do through all of the other crises - to set up a commission of investigation.  Within hours the presented narrative had begun to unravel.  We discovered that a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, report published last June had clearly identified the Garda practice of recording outgoing and incoming calls.  In other words, this news was not new.  At the time the ombudsman stated the \"Garda Commissioner may wish to re-evaluate his practise regarding the recording of such calls.\"  The Minister has today alleged that the report was not sent to either his desk or the Department.  It is remarkable that, with the array of staff available in the Department of Justice and Equality, not one person was dedicated to monitor reports of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting nobody in the army of staff available to him has monitored the concerns of GSOC and acted on them, even when there is such a serious recommendation made to the Garda Commissioner?  That would be remarkable.  Is it credible that the Minister was not told about GSOC's concerns?<\/p><p>  We know that the Garda Commissioner discussed this issue with the Attorney General in November, the same month in which the practice was stopped.  The Attorney General - a Cabinet colleague and member of the Government - knew for almost six months about the illegal recording of conversations.  Nevertheless, the Taoiseach has said he was only told on Sunday, while the Minister claims he only heard on Monday evening and received a letter on Tuesday morning.<\/p><p>  In a further twist it was revealed that the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, had written to the Department of Justice and Equality two weeks ago about the recordings.  It is reported that he sent a letter to the Secretary General of the Department and asked that the issue be brought to the Minister's attention.

Did these include detained persons speaking to their solicitors?  This is the latest in a series of debacles around An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the administration of justice and the Minister.  Each of these scandals has demonstrated an unhealthily close relationship between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, in which the Minister lost his objectivity and sense of responsibility to the Irish people and his office.

The Minister and the Garda Commissioner tried to prevent Sergeant McCabe giving evidence to the PAC.  Then there was the scandal of allegations of bugging at the office of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  The Minister's response was to seek to put GSOC in the dock, aided by the Taoiseach, who misrepresented the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 by implying that GSOC was the law-breaker.  The Minister then summoned the GSOC chairman to his office to ask why he and senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were not informed about GSOC's suspicions.  This action undermined the independence and integrity of that agency.<\/p><p>  The Minister told the D&aacute;il there was nothing there, nothing to see and to move on.  We then, however, discovered that there were sizeable omissions of terminology in his statement to the D&aacute;il about the report of Verimus, the security firm, given to him by GSOC.  A written report was sent to the Minister the night before he made his speech to the D&aacute;il on Tuesday, 11 February.  On the following Tuesday, 18 February, the Minister presented a peer review from an Irish security company, Rits, in which he said not only was there no definitive evidence of surveillance or bugging but no evidence whatsoever, and that there would be a rebuttal.  We await evidence of that.  An Oireachtas committee will seek it in due course. <\/p><p>  Instead of establishing a commission of investigation, the Government appointed retired judge, John Cooke, to carry out a review with terms of reference set by the Minister.  It falls far short of what is required to get to the bottom of that issue.  The Government presented the latest revelation as if it knew nothing until this weekend about it.  This ignores the fact that the Government, through the Department of Justice and Equality, knew of these illegal recordings as early as last June, and that the Attorney General, the Minister's Cabinet colleague, knew of them also, at the very latest, by November.<\/p><p>  The Government did know but the Taoiseach was not told until Sunday.  The Minister claims he knew nothing of this until Monday and Tuesday.  By his actions, through his dysfunctional relationship with the Garda Commissioner, and by his failure to deal properly and effectively with a series of highly charged and important issues, the Minister has undermined public confidence in the position of Minister for Justice and Equality, in the Department of Justice and Equality, in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the administration of justice.  The appointment of a commission of investigation on this issue will not assuage public concern, given the level of public distrust that now exists.  I and my party welcome the fact that the Government has now indicated a belated conversion to the need for a fully accountable, independent Garda authority-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600014#M00800","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1395832800,"counter":207,"content":"<p>It has been our policy for years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600014#M00900","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1395832800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>The Minister, however, who will be responsible for overseeing this process, is the very Minister who has been at the heart of all of the recent scandals.  I note that the independent policing authority was not included in the programme for Government.  Hence the importance some parties attribute to that decision.  There is an opportunity for a step change, a new beginning, in policing, policing structures and the administration of justice in this State, an opportunity to get politicians out of policing matters.  It will be a lost opportunity if this process is not taken on.<\/p><p>  To be successful, a new beginning for policing in this State needs a new Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Taoiseach has said he will not ask you to resign.  That is a mistake.  Perhaps the Minister could on this occasion take the right decision and, like his friend Martin Callinan, resign.<\/p><p>  There is widespread public support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The service has a unique, deep-rooted connection to communities, which the Government is actively dismantling through its policy of closing 140 Garda stations, cutting the number of Garda vehicles and reducing the number of garda&iacute; by 10%.  There is, however, a culture of bad administration, a lack of accountable and oversight mechanisms and transparency.  This culture, which smacks of cronyism, elitism and the corrosive, corruptive relationship with the elites, which the Government pledged to root out, is now evident in other institutions of the State.  It is a culture among senior management that betrays the sacrifice and integrity of rank and file garda&iacute;.  There are over 13,000 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across the State, men and women, the overwhelming majority of whom have done no wrong.  They have been profoundly failed by a cabal of senior management and the Minister.  The message should go out clearly today that the vast majority of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to have the unwavering support of the Irish people but the Minister does not, and neither did the outgoing Commissioner. <\/p><p>  This culture was evident in the failure to investigate properly the Fr. Molloy case or the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  It stems, to a large degree, from the fact that for many years political leaders allowed the legal, judicial and policing system in this State become an adjunct of British counter-insurgency in the North of Ireland.

It was evident in the failure to investigate properly murders such as that of my colleague in Donegal, Councillor Eddie Fullerton, in 1991.  There is now an opportunity to change all of this.  That means creating an independent, accountable and transparent Garda Authority.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Government's belated conversion to the necessary reform but it is worth noting that neither Fine Gael nor Labour put it in the programme for Government.  If the Government has come to that position now and if we see fundamental change the Irish people will at least have some sense of reassurance out of the mess of recent years.<\/p><p>  No police service, no senior police officer and no Garda Commissioner should be solely accountable to a politician, no matter who that is.  The Garda Commissioner should be fully accountable to an independent policing board, to the Oireachtas and to local joint policing committees, which should be much stronger than they are now.  Policing in this State has been too long locked into structures that obstruct the building of a modern, 21st century, accountable policing service.  I ask the Minister to play his part in building it by stepping aside.  The Garda confidential recipient and the Garda Commissioner have walked the plank, now it is time for the Minister to walk the plank to restore public confidence in the administration of justice so that we can collectively rebuild a modern police service for the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600014#M01200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1395833400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>He cannot even see the plank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600015#N00100","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1395833400,"counter":212,"content":"<p>At this stage we are used to the Minister's approach to dealing with the Garda controversies over which he has presided.  His approach consists of blanket denial for as long as possible in order to save face, followed by partial admission on a drip-drip basis through his favourite media, which hide the real extent and seriousness of the issues arising, misrepresentation of the facts and the law in this Chamber and, finally, frantic finger-pointing at anyone who might act as a fall guy and save his political career.  He appears to give only incidental consideration to his ministerial duties, the reputation of and public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the administration of justice and fair application of the rule of law in this State.  See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil is the order of the day.<\/p><p>  The Minister wants us to believe several claims.  First, that nobody told him about the content of the June 2013 GSOC report, even though it has been in the public domain for almost a year.  Even if he did know about it, the Minister and his Department did not consider it their responsibility to investigate whether the practice was widespread.  He described it as an operational matter for the Garda, which is an expression he favours when off-loading culpability.  Second, that in November 2013 the Minister's friend the Garda Commissioner issued a directive to senior garda&iacute; to discontinue the widespread practice, but the Minister and his Department remained unaware of this until the Taoiseach told him about it a few days ago.  Third, that a judge struck down the practice in open court but neither the Minister nor his Department ever heard about it.  Fourth, that a working group was established in November, with the Commissioner and the Attorney General attending meetings, but nobody told the Minister about it and he never attended meetings.  Fifth, that the advice of a senior counsel was sought but nobody told the Minister.  Sixth, that a letter from the Commissioner which was marked &quot;Urgent&quot; and sent by courier was not brought to the Minister's attention until Monday or Tuesday despite being delivered two weeks ago.  Seventh, that it is everybody's fault but the Minister's.  Having dispensed with the confidential recipient and the Commissioner, and doing his best to do the same with GSOC, he now appears to blame the civil servants in his Department and the Attorney General.  This Government, and particularly the Labour Party Members who appointed the Attorney General, will have to make a choice about who is to be sacrificed to survive the latest mess - the Secretary General, the Attorney General or the Minister.

His attempt to normalise the latest crisis as no big deal has a shamefully familiar ring.  When is the Government going to realise that we have a crisis of policing in this State?  His reactionary response was to say that he would establish an independent Garda authority, even though he laughed Deputy Wallace out of court when he introduced legislation to that effect last year.  That is not a genuine attempt at reform.<\/p><p>  The Minister stated that the reason this information is now being acted on is that serious information was likely to come into the public domain regarding a horrendous miscarriage of justice and the fitting up of two citizens.  That is clearly a serious and, sadly, all-too-familiar allegation.  We have had heard many cases involving people who were wrongly treated by some members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is also appalling that the recordings were made.  It is not possible to address that issue in detail in the context of breaches of privacy, but the central issues arising are the Minister's brazenness and barefaced denials, and the Government's serious mistake in continuing to back him.  It is not credible that he did not know.  On 21 May 2013 he told this House that the Commissioner had a duty to tell him about Deputy Wallace's non-event, but now he is saying the Commissioner did not have a duty to tell him about the most recent issue and he does not have a problem with that.  He berated GSOC for not telling him about the bugging.  He listed every piece of legislation he could think of.  Today he devoted several minutes of his speech to explaining why GSOC did not have to inform him and why he does not have a problem with that.  Either he does not realise how serious this issue is or he is covering up.  Either way, his position is not credible.  We are presiding over a dysfunctional police force.  It is undermining the confidence of decent garda&iacute; and the citizens.  This is why the Garda Commissioner had no alternative to resigning.  When is the penny going to drop with the Minister that he must do the same?<\/p><p>  These are not isolated incidents; they are indicative of a systemic problem.

For St. Patrick's Day he was sent to Mexico, home of the legendary stand-off, when obviously he should have been sent barefoot to Croagh Patrick to see if his arrogance could be treated there.

What the Government is saying beggars belief.  I would leave out the second &quot;U&quot; from the acronym, however, because this situation is not unprecedented.  I would describe it as GUB, or the Government's unbelievable bull.  This Minister will shortly be gone.  Members can take it for granted that he is history.  However, the opportunism and incompetence of the Taoiseach also comes into play, as does the cowardice of Labour Party Ministers in regard to what they are prepared to tolerate.

There was a sense coming up to yesterday's Cabinet meeting that the Minister was under extreme pressure from his colleagues within the Cabinet, in particular.  It was seen as a crunch meeting for him.  We learned early yesterday morning that the Garda Commissioner had resigned-retired, of which the Taoiseach made an issue.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether a civil servant did, in fact, go to the Commissioner the night before?  This is in the public domain.  I did not put it there, but the assertion was made on RTE's \"Prime Time\" programme.  It is an important point that needs clarification.  The Commissioner resigned and the Taoiseach brought me and Deputy Gerry Adams to brief us on something that apparently was very new to him, the Cabinet and everyone else that would merit the immediate establishment of a commission of inquiry.  He said the Attorney General had gone to him on Sunday night about a specific case in which proceedings had been taken against the State and the discovery launched.  We have learned from the Minister this morning that the Attorney General was aware of the case for about four months.  We were also told by him this morning that there was a meeting on 28 February in the Department of Justice and Equality between officials of the Department and that they would have been aware of the recordings and the issue related to the specific case.  The Taoiseach's presentation to us yesterday was that it was that very specific case that had necessitated the establishment of a commission of inquiry and that the matter was new.

As Taoiseach, I thought that this matter was of very considerable concern in the sense of having confidence, public accountability and trust in the justice system.  For that reason, I advised the Attorney General that all of the facts both of the individual case and the wider trawl should be assessed by somebody competent in the legal profession to see how serious the issue was.

I know that the media focus was on crunch meetings to deal with the comments made by the former Commissioner at the Committee of Public Accounts and the comments made by the Minister for Justice and Equality in the D&aacute;il.  The public comment was about what was going to happen, but this is a matter that goes beyond that because it does not just deal with a single case which I cannot name, as I explained to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin yesterday, in the sense that there are now more than 2,500 tapes up to 2008 and from that period until the process was terminated last November.  The recordings are in digital format and I do not know the extent or scale of what is involved.  That is why yesterday the Government made very clear and particular decisions.  What I want out of this is an independent statutory authority to deal with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which the people could have faith and belief that the matters that have come to light would be dealt with.  They will be dealt with and I will see to it that they are.  I want the Deputy to be as constructive as he can be in the fundamental issue that is at stake.  While Deputy Mattie McGrath may laugh at the fact that the Attorney General did not wish to comment on this serious matter over the telephone, I completely reject his assertion.

This morning, for example, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, had the opportunity to withdraw his disgraceful remarks about Garda John Wilson and Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  He refused to that.  Is that acceptable?  Yesterday the Taoiseach briefed myself and Teachta Martin, and I thank him for that.  He told us that he was made aware on Sunday that there were very serious revelations emerging about the illegal recording by garda&iacute; of phone calls in and out of Garda stations, but after the briefing it emerged that this practice had been brought to the Government's attention on at least three occasions, one, with the publication of the GSOC report in June 2013, two, with the discontinuation of this practice in November 2013 and, yesterday in this Chamber, I asked the Taoiseach if the Garda Commissioner knew of the phone recordings before he put in his letter of retirement.  He refused to answer me.  Now we know that not only did he know but that he wrote to the Government about this.  I have no reason to disbelieve the Taoiseach's assertion that he only knew about all of this on Sunday.<\/p><p>I accept the Taoiseach at his word, but is it acceptable to him that when the Department of Justice and Equality and the Minister are in the eye of a storm and a saga of tsunamis of controversies that he is not told?  The Taoiseach was not told.  What sort of Government is he running?  We speak about dysfunctionality.  Why was he not told?  Personal loyalty may be an admirable trait, but I am sure the Taoiseach would agree it should not be put before the common good.  If the Taoiseach keeps backing the Minister, Deputy Shatter, this is what he is doing.  He is bringing his own office into this controversy by standing over something which is clearly and patently, leaving other considerations to one side and everything else out of it, incompetence, which is good reason to get rid of the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  Will the Taoiseach reflect on all of this, step outside of his office for a moment, look at how this is seen by ordinary citizens and do the right thing and ask the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to go?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600019#R05000","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395836400,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Adams for his contribution.  According to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission's report on the Waterford case the court referred specifically to the practice engaged in by the garda&iacute; at Waterford Garda station, and the trawl conducted by the working group established by the Garda, and not associated with the Office of the Attorney General, came to the conclusion there were far more tapes than just those in the Waterford case.  We now know the extent of the first tranche of these up to 2008.  Beyond lie the digital recordings and I do not know the extent of these.  This is why we have established the commission of investigation to examine this issue.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, was not to deal with the question of the whistleblowers in this section of today's discussions.  This deals with the revelation of the extent of tape recordings, what they mean and what they might mean for court cases which have been held or pending.  Clearly there are implications for defence lawyers and people involved in court cases.  I do not know the content of the vast majority of any of these tapes because they must be transcribed.  They may be very ordinary queries about very ordinary matters.  The point is that in the Waterford case Judge Reynolds deemed the information to be inadmissible.<\/p><p>  I do not get a chance to read everything.  Obviously I cannot do so.

It is not related to the justice area but it is parallel.<\/p><p>  In this case I went back and read the documentation about the O'Mahoney report in respect of the whistleblowers.

When I heard this, it sounded to me like the actions of the old Stasi in East Germany.  As all Members are aware, the implications for cases before the courts and for existing sentences are unknown but may be profound.  Members have heard allegations of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, being bugged.  The report on penalty points has been published.  The whistleblowers have been smeared both by their own Commissioner and by the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  The Commissioner has resigned and now Members have received news of widespread bugging.  Yesterday's news has shocked an already demoralised police force and undoubtedly has eroded further public trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The task ahead is herculean in respect of driving substantial change in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and rebuilding the trust not merely of the public but of rank-and-file garda&iacute; in their own police force.<\/p><p>  I have a great deal of respect for the Minister, Deputy Shatter, as a legislator.  His insolvency legislation probably is the single most important measure this Government has taken to solve the mortgage crisis.  However, the challenges ahead must be led by a Minister who commands the respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Oireachtas and the public.  Regrettably, it is clear that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, no longer is that person.  There simply are too many questions.  Why did the Attorney General approach the Taoiseach rather than the Minister?  Why has the Minister still not withdrawn his remarks about the whistleblowers?  Why has the Minister still not called on the former Commissioner to withdraw his outrageous remarks about the whistleblowers?  Why did the Minister attack GSOC when it raised concerns about being bugged?   Why did the Minister fire the confidential recipient for doing his job?  Why did the Minister use confidential information to smear Deputy Wallace on national television?  Why is the Attorney General not willing to discuss sensitive information with the leader of this country by telephone?  The Minister does not have the trust of rank-and-file garda&iacute;.  He does not have the trust of the Oireachtas.  He does not have the trust of GSOC and he does not have the trust of the public.  Moreover, he would appear not to have the trust of the Attorney General.  While he may have the Taoiseach's trust, that is not enough for what must happen.  Consequently, together with many others, I must ask the Taoiseach whether he will put the interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the public ahead of his loyalty to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and ask for him to step back, based on the amount of work that must be done and the person who will be needed to drive that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600021#T00500","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1395837000,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.

While the meeting focused on developments in Ukraine, it also had a wider agenda with an economic focus, including the European semester, the Europe 2020 strategy, industrial competitiveness, climate change and energy, banking union, taxation and external relations.  In addition to developments in Ukraine, the Council discussed three other external relations items, namely, preparations for the EU-Africa summit, recent progress in negotiations toward the reunification of Cyprus and an international investigation into alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka.  The Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, will go over these issues in his statement, as well as reporting on the industrial competitiveness discussions which are part of the ongoing efforts of EU leaders to promote economic growth and job creation.<\/p><p>  Last week's annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation constitutes a dangerous precedent with no place in the Europe of the 21st century.  The European Council last week reiterated the European Union's support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, while strongly condemning the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.  The European Union will not recognise the referendum of 16 March in Crimea which was in clear violation of the Ukrainian constitution.  Last week's summit asked the European Commission to evaluate the legal consequences of the annexation of Crimea and to propose economic, trade and financial restrictions for rapid implementation.<\/p><p>  As Ireland and its partners have made absolutely clear, Russia's actions are in breach of its international and bilateral obligations, including the Helsinki accord which in the past 40 years has contributed to overcoming divisions in Europe and building a peaceful continent.  Frankly, Russia is only isolating itself by its actions and I urge it to reconsider its approach as a matter of urgency.  Any further destabilisation could have serious consequences for European stability and security.  Europe and the world need stability based on the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Russia's behaviour is endangering this stability and represents a direct threat not just to Ukraine but also to all of its neighbours, as well as the wider international community.<\/p><p>  Against the backdrop of these deeply disturbing developments and in the absence of steps towards de-escalation by Russia, last week's European Council took the following additional, concrete measures.  It extended the visa ban and asset freeze to an additional 12 individuals, cancelled the next EU-Russia summit and agreed not to hold regular bilateral summits, agreed to support suspension of Russia's accession negotiations to the OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the IEA, International Energy Agency, urged timely agreement on an OSCE, Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, mission in Ukraine, and agreed, if no agreement on a credible OSCE mission is reached in the coming days, to draw up an EU mission.  This matter has been dealt with since the Council meeting.  The Council also made it clear that further steps by Russia to destabilise the situation in Ukraine would lead to additional and far-reaching consequences for relations in a broad range of economic areas and we called on the Commission and member states to prepare possible targeted sanctions.  It was decided to advance the signature of the association agreements with Georgia and Moldova to June this year<\/p><p>  These additional measures follow on from the steps which we took at our meeting on 6 March, namely, suspension of work with the Russian Federation on visa matters and the new agreement on an enhanced EU-Russia partnership and co-operation agreement.  This came in addition to the suspension of preparatory work for the G8 summit.  The Foreign Affairs Council subsequently introduced travel restrictions and an asset freeze against those responsible for undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.<\/p><p>  The nature and scope of sanctions is always a complex and difficult issue.  As I said in Brussels last week, inevitably, they will have negative economic consequences for the European Union, including Ireland, as well as for Russia.  It is only right, therefore, that we prepare such decisions carefully and we have tasked the Commission accordingly.  As a small country which has traditionally relied on respect for the rule of law as the fundamental guarantor of stability in the international system, Ireland should take a firm position on what has happened in Ukraine.  It would be wrong, however, to suggest this is only an Irish view.  The conclusions of last week's European Council made it explicit that &quot;there is no place for the use of force and coercion to change borders in Europe in the 21st century&quot;.  As a country which had the honour to serve as the chair in office of the OSCE as recently as 2012, I do not see how Ireland could fail to take a strong view on such matters.<\/p><p>  The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy for the European Union, Catherine Ashton, has been tasked by us to draw up plans for an EU contribution to facilitate the work of the OSCE special monitoring mission to Ukraine, the terms of which were agreed to by the OSCE last Friday.  Ireland is, of course, open to participation in the OSCE mission.<\/p><p>  In parallel with the additional measures against the Russian Federation, the European Council emphasised EU support for Ukraine, including through macro-financial assistance.  I also strongly support the economic assistance package of &euro;11 billion announced by the European Commission President, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, on 6 March.  This is a further demonstration of our support for and solidarity with the authorities in Kiev which continue to show commendable restraint in the face of huge provocation.  Together with the other leaders and in the presence of Ukraine's Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, I signed the political provisions of the association agreement with Ukraine on the second day of the European Council.  The European Union is committed to signing the remainder of the association agreement on a deep and comprehensive free trade area.  In the meantime, the Union will soon temporarily remove customs duties on Ukrainian exports to the European market.  These steps are proof of the European Union and Ukraine's shared wish for closer political association and economic integration.<\/p><p>  We welcomed the Ukrainian Government's commitment to ensure its structures were inclusive and reflected regional diversity, as well as ensuring full protection of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities.  We also welcomed the commitment to undertake constitutional reform, to investigate all human rights violations and acts of violence and to fight extremism.  The European Council further encouraged Ukraine to ensure its presidential election on 25 May would be free and fair.<\/p><p>  Last week's summit also reconfirmed the European Union's wish to further strengthen its political association and economic integration with Georgia and Moldova.  We indicated that we aimed to sign the association agreements with these countries no later than June.<\/p><p>  Overall, we have sent a clear message to Russia that our words are backed up with firm intent, even though the measures will entail consequences for all of us.  However, while there is a need to demonstrate our resolve to Russia and the signs are not at all positive, we need to keep channels of communication open.  Dialogue remains important, particularly when differences are most acute.  Ireland and its EU partners will also make their views known at the United Nations.  This is not a dispute between the European Union and Russia.  What is happening in Ukraine is a direct challenge to the rule of law and has implications for the whole global community.<\/p><p>  The economic agenda touched on the European semester and the review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  Last week's meeting concluded the first phase of the European semester for 2014 by finalising guidance on this year's national reform plans.  We placed particular emphasis on policies enhancing competitiveness, supporting job creation and fighting unemployment.  Ireland will be a full participant in this year's European semester process following successful completion of its EU-IMF programme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, will update the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs on our preparations on Tuesday, 1 April.<\/p><p>  We also took stock last week of progress in implementing the Europe 2020 strategy.  Exchanges were informed by the European Commission's recent communication which showed quite clearly that overall performance was mixed and that the crisis had slowed down progress towards key goals.  The modest European economic recovery must be supported by strong re-engagement with Europe's post-crisis strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  I welcome the European Council's call on member states to step up efforts to reach the 2020 targets.  The Commission plans to launch a full public consultation in April.  I hope we will see strong stakeholder engagement with this consultation, including from national parliaments.<\/p><p>  Last week's meeting also considered progress in completing banking union.  I was pleased that the European Council welcomed the agreement reached with European Parliament negotiators on the next pillar of banking union, namely, the single resolution mechanism, SRM.  The SRM is an important contributory factor to breaking the link between sovereign and banking debt.  The new mechanism will allow decisions to be made in an objective and independent fashion.  These decisions will be taken in line with the principles of resolution set out in the bank recovery and resolution proposal.  This means that shareholders and creditors should bear the costs of resolution before any external funding is guaranteed, while private sector solutions should be found instead of using taxpayers' money.<\/p><p>  Aspects of the SRM relating to financing are covered by an intergovernmental agreement.  Significantly, the agreement with the European Parliament reduces the period of mutualisation from ten to eight years.  The pace of mutualisation has also been accelerated to allow for 40% mutualisation in year one, followed by an additional 20% in year two, an important development for the overall credibility of the project.  It signals that we are serious about breaking the link between the sovereign and the banking sector.  The agreement also provides that steps will be taken to develop appropriate methods and modalities to enhance the borrowing capacity of the Single Resolution Fund.  The purpose is to ensure adequate funding can be provided by the fund at all times.  I expect the regulation on the SRM will now be formally adopted before the European Parliament rises for elections.<\/p><p>  Taxation was also included in the agenda for last week's meeting.  On this item, I was pleased that the European Council could finally welcome agreement on the savings tax directive.  Ireland supported the directive which I see as a significant contribution to EU and international efforts to combat tax fraud and evasion.<\/p><p>  Climate change and energy were also a focus at last week's meeting.  My colleagues and I held a first policy debate based on the European Commission's communication on the framework for climate and energy to 2030.  This represents the next phase in the European Union's transition to a competitive, low-carbon economy by 2050.  The issue requires careful consideration.  Ambition and flexibility are important features of the package.  However, the outcome must also be sustainable on environmental, economic and competitiveness grounds for the Euopean Union and individual member states.  We support in principle the proposed targets set out in the Commission's communication, namely, a 40% reduction in EU-level greenhouse gas emissions and a proposed EU-wide 27% target for renewable energy by 2030.<\/p><p>We need to be ambitious, but we also need to be very clear about the commitments we undertake.  We need good and agreed data on which to base decisions.  The European Council agreed on the need for further urgent analysis of the implications for member states of the proposals for emissions reductions and renewable energy.  I made clear that for Ireland, particular account must be taken of the role of agriculture.  This is already set out clearly in the Commission communication, and during discussions at last week's meeting, President Van Rompuy was reassuring on this aspect.  Therefore, the agri-sector is confirmed as being part of the flexibility in reflecting national circumstances in the decision mix made.  This is important from Ireland's perspective.  We believe that a coherent and cost-effective approach to the parallel priorities of sustainable food production and climate change is fundamental.  A realistic way forward at national, EU and wider international level under the UN convention requires such an approach.  Leaders also called on the Council and the Commission to elaborate on mechanisms for fair effort sharing and to modernise the energy sector, prevent carbon leakage and develop an energy efficiency framework.  We will take stock of progress on these issues at the June European Council meeting, with a view to taking a final decision by October 2014.  This will facilitate an agreed EU position at the UN Climate Conference in Paris in 2015.<\/p><p> The European Council also agreed to accelerate efforts to complete the internal energy market this year, including through increased electricity interconnections, including in the Iberian peninsula, the Mediterranean region and the southern corridor from eastern European countries.  Discussions on energy, and energy security in particular, had an added urgency in light of the Ukraine crisis.  The Commission has been asked to prepare a detailed analysis of Europe's energy security and a comprehensive plan to reduce energy dependence in time for the June European Council.  The Council also agreed to support the development of other sources of energy supply, including examining ways to facilitate natural gas exports from North America to the European Union.  We will consider how this may best be reflected in the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP.  This refers specifically to liquefied natural gas.<\/p><p> To conclude, I hope I have given Deputies a reasonable overview of the discussions that took place last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600024#W00200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395839400,"counter":543,"content":"<p>In the early days of what is now the European Union, one of its founders, Jean Monnet, talked frequently about how it might develop.  His most often quoted idea was: \"Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.\"  When looking at the outcome of last week's summit and those of recent years, it is impossible to miss the power of this idea.  We are five years into the biggest crisis since the Union was founded.  A financial crisis became an economic one which has hit many millions of citizens throughout the Union.  The sum of the solutions adopted to tackle this crisis appears to have been reached and the outcome is one that should worry anyone who cares about the future of the Union and its member states.  In recent weeks, this has been joined by a dramatic escalation of a wider crisis, which has many new economic, political and security dimensions.<\/p><p>  The decision of Russia to try first to maintain control over and then annex a region of a neighbouring state is fundamentally a challenge to the idea that Europe is a space of peace and co-operation between nations.  It is a reminder to all of us that there are very uncomfortable decisions to be taken if we are to be true to the values of democracy and human rights.  It has brought to the fore the absolute need to remember what unites us and put aside short-term concerns.  The decision of the Council to extend the list of persons subject to sanctions was reasonable.  In particular, there appears to be real agreement about going to stage three sanctions if there are any further efforts to subvert Ukrainian sovereignty.  This is the least that could be done in the circumstances.  The debate at the Council was between those who wanted a more extensive list and those who wanted to do almost nothing.  It is welcome that Poland and other states were listened to during the meeting and that the final communiqu&eacute; was significantly toughened from the opening, rather abject, proposal.  We would have welcomed it if the Council had at least matched the list of sanctions published by the United States.  Those sanctions appear to have had a real impact on the private financial networks of people intimately connected with Russia's expansionist policy.  Given the reach of the financial system of the United States and the legal force it applies behind sanctions, duplication of the list by the European Union is not essential.  Because there have been so few occasions for welcoming the major outcomes of summits in recent years, it is important that we acknowledge that leaders overcame the divisions between them of recent weeks.  They applied themselves to working together and seem to have understood that a failure to act together would have been disastrous for the Union.  The contributions of Poland and the Baltic States, in particular, were valuable in reminding others that there comes a point at which narrow commercial interests cannot be allowed to trump basic principles.<\/p><p>  As I have said previously, Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports the Government's position condemning the illegal actions by Russia.  The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste have left no room for doubt on this.  What is not clear at all is where Ireland stands on the specific issues which have been decided by leaders at the summit.  The Taoiseach told us yesterday that two different approaches were proposed at the summit.  He then outlined the final agreement and said that Ireland supports it.  However, he did not say what Ireland's position was during the discussion and I have found it difficult to get an answer on that.<\/p><p>  There has been a concerted propaganda campaign by Russia to justify its actions.  The arguments it is using today are completely different from those it was using at the start of the crisis.  Thankfully, the number of parties and individuals falling for the Russian line or who seem committed to staying silent no matter what Russia does is small.  However, it is worth mentioning the response to Russia's evolving arguments.  In recent weeks, and again yesterday during Deputy Adams's contribution on Question Time, Sinn F&eacute;in has been reluctant to utter a word of rebuke towards Russia.  It has now started the line that what is at issue is self-determination by the people of Crimea.  This is an extraordinary argument.  There is a majority of Russians in Crimea, but this has not always been the case.  It was an almost uniformly Tatar area until relatively recently.  The current population balance is the result of what we now term ethnic cleansing.<\/p><p>  The issue of Crimea becoming a part of Russia only became live when Russia decided it would activate it.  Russia still has a powerful imperial mindset concerning its former subject states.  Once it became clear that the people of Ukraine wanted to assert their independence of Russian control, Russia simply decided it would partition parts of Ukraine where it felt it could sustain a majority.  Last week's referendum was completely illegitimate.  It was held with Russian troops on the streets and no dissenting voices were allowed.  Less than two weeks elapsed between the calling of the vote and the announcement of the result.  Independent observers were kept out by the threat of violence.  This included the firing of warning shots over the head of an Irish officer.  The belligerent speech of President Putin confirmed that this was a planned annexation.  We should also understand that Crimea is now subject to deeply anti-democratic laws.  Due to a measure enacted in recent days, it is now a crime to publicly question the annexation.  If one is a Tatar or Ukrainian in Crimea, one may end up in gaol for saying one does not want to belong to Russia.  The invasion and annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia is the type of action that has not happened in Europe since 1968.  From beginning to end, this was a manufactured situation.  The statement that Europe is somehow to blame by supposedly forcing Ukraine into a choice between Russia and Europe is outrageous.<\/p><p>  I would like to acknowledge the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade on this topic.  It does great work, but is rarely given the attention it deserves.  In particular, I would like to commend it on its session with the Russian ambassador.  Deputy Bernard Durkan, in the Chair, Deputy Eric Byrne and Deputy Brendan Smith made sure that Russia's aggressive propaganda was challenged.  In particular, they made sure that implied threats were seen to have no impact on the views of the overwhelming majority of Oireachtas Members.<\/p><p>  The presence of large numbers of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders is ominous, but it does not seem there is an immediate likelihood of their annexing further territory.<\/p><p>In spite of repeated provocation, it appears that the eastern areas of Ukraine have not been destabilised.<\/p><p> The red line which the summit drew, beyond which escalating economic sanctions would be imposed, is a restrained and reasonable response.  Any escalation will be because Russia has decided to escalate the crisis and not because of anything the European Union has done.  <\/p><p> It is also correct that the association agreement with Ukraine starts first with the political aspects.  The undermining of Ukrainian democracy in recent years has been profound.  Wider civil society has suffered a sustained attack and democratic roots are weak.  The European Union cannot compromise on its democratic principles and must hold the Ukrainian Government to account.  The extremist elements who gained prominence during the last months of the Yanukovych regime are not acceptable partners.  Thankfully, there are signs of democratic parties pushing back against their influence and we should do everything possible to support them.  The European Union&rsquo;s aid programme must prioritise support for civil society organisations which provide the essential counterbalance for a political system which has repeatedly failed the Ukrainian people.<\/p><p> It was timely that there was a discussion about energy on the summit's agenda.  Given how often Britain plays a negative role at the Council and its repeated efforts to stop the European Union becoming more active, we should note Prime Minister Cameron&rsquo;s very positive initiative on energy before the summit.  Energy dependence on Russia is a profound strategic weakness for the European Union.  The Russian state exerts tight control on its energy sector and has repeatedly shown a willingness to see energy as part of its strategic arsenal when dealing with other states.  Now is the time for the European Union to push ahead with a determined effort to secure real energy independence.  It must diversify both the sources and types of energy it uses.  It must end the practice where individual states are picked off in highly suspicious ways.  This has blocked alternative supply routes and increased reliance on Russia.  Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schr&ouml;der&rsquo;s lucrative job with the Nord Stream project still leaves a bitter taste in many mouths.  I welcome the summit&rsquo;s decision to show more urgency on energy independence and hope this resolve will be maintained.<\/p><p> The summit took place against the backdrop of ongoing negotiations with the European Parliament on key elements of the so-called banking union.  The Parliament&rsquo;s position that the resolution mechanism agreed to by leaders is inadequate is correct.  It involves too little money; there is too much national involvement and not enough banks.  By covering no more than 1% of covered assets and then only after a lengthy lead-in time, it does not provide a credible resolution mechanism.  By only phasing in mutualisation it specifically fails to break the link between sovereign and financial debt.<\/p><p> The few concessions secured by the European Parliament are extremely welcome.  They dilute somewhat the worst elements of the Council&rsquo;s deal.  For this I particularly acknowledge the leadership of Sharon Bowles of the ALDE, Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, group.  Nobody can say with confidence that the eurozone financial system has been placed on sound foundations.  We still have a single currency without a genuine banking union.  What is much worse is that we are heading into bank stress tests without the confidence that genuine and tough results can be managed.<\/p><p> ECB president Mario Draghi&rsquo;s letter to Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s spokesperson, Deputy Michael McGrath, shows that the Government&rsquo;s complacent line about everything having been sorted is false.  The Draghi letter confirms that there are serious issues remaining relating to Irish banks.  There is no engagement with the idea of retrospective recapitalisation.  Yesterday I directly asked the Taoiseach if he would state what Ireland was looking for in this regard.  Just as he has done for a year and a half, he refused to say anything.  A year and a half after he and his Ministers announced victory on the issue of bank debt they have not only achieved nothing, they will not even say what, if anything, they are asking for.  It is now well established that Mr. Draghi&rsquo;s decisions have been far more significant for the economy than any taken by the Government, particularly as it waited three years before announcing an economic policy.  Mr. Draghi&rsquo;s commitment to fight against threatened deflation is very welcome.  We should note also the news yesterday that the head of the Bundesbank had indicated that he would not oppose quantitative easing in all circumstances.  This is the first time he has said on the record that the ECB could buy government bonds at issuance.  Instead of sitting on the sidelines, Ireland should make a clear statement that it supports Mr. Draghi&rsquo;s initiatives and that it believes quantitative easing is an appropriate response to low growth and threatened deflation.<\/p><p> A further major threat to Ireland is emerging.  From the very moment the conversion of the promissory notes into sovereign debt was announced by the Government, my party has been pointing out that the deal is worth nowhere near what was being claimed.  As recently as December, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, was involved in inflating the claim even more when he announced on radio that the promissory notes had been &ldquo;ripped up&rdquo;.  Nothing of the sort happened.  Today a very serious piece of news has been reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  It is right that the appalling behaviour of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s continued support of him have dominated public attention in recent days, but we cannot let other, potentially dramatic, news pass without reference.  It is being reported that there is new pressure from the ECB council on the Central Bank of Ireland to sell its holding of Irish bonds.  If this were to happen, billions of euro in interest on the bonds issued to replace the promissory notes would be lost to the State.  Every single positive economic impact of the arrangement announced last year requires the Central Bank to hold these bonds for as long as possible, preferably to maturity.  The Taoiseach owes it to us to explain what is going on.  Is he aware of these pressures to sell the bonds?  Has he made any intervention?  If this happens, a central plank of the Government&rsquo;s claims will have been destroyed and Ireland will lose billions of euro which should be available for public services.<\/p><p> The sum of the actions agreed to to tackle the financial and economic crisis shows a generation of leaders committed to finding a way to muddle through rather than address core problems.  The lack of leadership remains striking.  In the discussions about who will serve as presidents of the Council and the Commission we do not need a ready-up between the big parties.  We need people of drive and vision who want to reform and develop the European Union and end the damaging policy of maximising disputes and minimising ambition.  Given that those in these positions will set the direction of the European Union for the next five years, the Taoiseach owes it to us to come to the House before the informal meeting on 27 May to outline his views.  It will not be acceptable if all we get is another case in which the Government waits to hear the outcome before it tells us what it is seeking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600025#X00200","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395840000,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I apologise for the absence of my colleague and leader, Deputy Gerry Adams, who, unfortunately, is attending a funeral at Glasnevin Cemetery.  He is speaking at the funeral of its resident historian, curator and tour guide, Shane MacThom&aacute;is, who was a long-standing member of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Ar dheis d&eacute; go raibh a anam.  I am sure the House shares my view on the unfortunate death of this young man and that at some stage others will have their own remarks to make.<\/p><p>  Last week we were told the European Council had agreed the shape of a new single resolution mechanism and its fund as the final piece of the banking union jigsaw.  However, it is highly questionable whether that fund is fit for purpose and whether what was achieved last week will do anything to separate banking and sovereign debt.  There is serious concern about the European Union's plan for banking union.  It appears Germany's interests have, once again, triumphed over everybody else's.  This view is shared by other parties across Europe.  It will be years before the fund is established as it was meant to be and in terms of how it was perceived it would be rolled out.  The ECB stress tests will tell the story of how far down the road to normality the banks have come.  The SME sector, in particular, will watch with concern how things develops.<\/p><p>  Does the Taoiseach have an update on the restructuring talks with the European Commission about Permanent TSB?  This is a concern for many of my constituents and others across the country.<\/p><p>There has been no progress on the important issue of retrospective recapitalisation of Irish banks.  Last week a number of players failed to support the Irish cause for retrospective recapitalisation in the European Parliament.  It seems the Government's political allies are the roadblock across Europe to retrospective recapitalisation of pillar banks and I am disappointed that there is no agreement on it.  There were all sorts of signals that this would happen but that has not come about.<\/p><p> There has been mention of Ukraine, and Deputy Martin spoke about the Sinn F&eacute;in position on the Russian invasion of Crimea, implying that Sinn F&eacute;in had gone soft on the matter.  When the Russian ambassador recently attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I thought I was as robust as any member.  I was equally robust with the Ukrainian representative when he attended, and I spoke of the worry I had about the make-up of that country's interim government.  The European Council has roundly condemned Russia on its actions in Crimea, and I have routinely called for open dialogue between all sides in Ukraine, respect for human rights and for foreign powers to end hostilities and rising tensions by stating they will not militarily intervene and will stop meddling in Ukraine's internal affairs.  I have stated this on a number of occasions, and I made it quite clear when speaking during the pre-Council statements in the D&aacute;il.  I have also previously mentioned in the House that the zero-sum geopolitical game played by both sides is doing nothing but harm to ordinary Ukrainians and inflaming further tensions.<\/p><p> News broke yesterday that Ukrainian special forces shot dead a far-right Ukrainian leader of the neo-Nazi Right Sector group in a shoot-out.  That is another incident likely to raise tensions between Kiev's new interim Government and the rest of the ultra-nationalist groups within the country that have secured between seven and nine key places in the government.  These are ministerial positions, including that of the deputy prime minister.  This episode highlights the fragility of the new opposition-led coalition, which has so far failed to persuade militia groups to disarm or step aside.  This is the difficult backdrop faced by the interim government.<\/p><p> The Council welcomed the Ukrainian Government's commitment to ensuring the representative nature and inclusiveness of the government structures, reflecting regional diversity and a commitment to protect minorities.  This does not seem to be what is happening on the ground.  Previously I spoke about people from a Jewish background, with the rabbi of Kiev telling us that people have had to leave the country.  The European Council has indicated one reality but others indicate the opposite.  Am I in a minority in saying I have seen nothing from the interim Government in Ukraine reflecting any inclusiveness or a new approach?  The Council has committed to signing new, deep and comprehensive trade agreements with Ukraine, but these depend on macroeconomic reform; I presume this is just another word for austerity.  The conclusions state that an agreement with the International Monetary Fund is critical to all economic reforms.  The Ukrainian people have suffered enough but it seems they will also come under the observation and dictatorial practices of the IMF, which is the organisation that was central to enforcing the crippling austerity measures in EU countries, including this one, which have brought nothing but unemployment, the destruction of social services and a worsened economic climate.<\/p><p> The conclusions state that substantial progress has been made towards the attainment of EU targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction, renewable energy and energy efficiency which must be fully met by 2020.  I had hoped the Taoiseach would go into more detail about the progress made on that front, and perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, will focus on the area in his reply.  We know climate change is one of the most serious and destructive issues facing our planet.  According to the annual report of the World Meteorological Organization, the UN's weather agency, much of the extreme weather that wreaked havoc in Asia, Europe and the Pacific region in 2013 can be directly blamed on human-induced climate change.  The report states that 2013 was the sixth warmest year on record, with 13 of the 14 warmest years occurring in the 21st century.  The big risks and overall effect of climate change are far more immediate and local than scientists once thought.  This is not purely a geographical issue or about melting ice or threatened animals and plants.  Climate change is making human problems such as hunger, disease, drought, flooding, war and refugee issues far worse.<\/p><p> I am worried that in trying to reduce greenhouse gas and carbon emissions, EU countries will increasingly turn to biofuels.  A mass increase in the harvesting of biofuels has its own environmental impact, such as soil erosion and drought, and there is a massive impact on food production and price volatility in that market, which affects the poorest on the planet.  I hope these issues were discussed in an open and frank way at the meeting, and I hope the Minister of State will focus on the Council's intentions in this regard.  For example, will there be discussion on replacement by European countries of food crops with biofuels, what companies are involved and what Europe will do about this?<\/p><p> I also note that the recent revival of the Cypriot reunification talks was raised at the European Council meeting.  We all welcome the recommencement of these talks and give the Cypriot Government complete support in its efforts to reunite the partitioned country.  Unfortunately, although it was agreed between negotiating parties that no inflammatory statements would be released while negotiations were ongoing, the Turkish Government has continued to release unhelpful comments relating to the talks, specifically by referring to &quot;two nations&quot; and &quot;two states&quot;.  Like me, I am sure the Taoiseach sees that as being extremely unhelpful and a breach of faith.  Will he use this opportunity to again call for a cessation of such unhelpful statements?<\/p><p> The European Council conclusions state it will support any confidence-building measures agreed by the parties in that region.  Does that include the Famagusta declaration?  This declaration proposes the formula for a return of Varosha to the UN, the opening of the Famagusta port to international maritime lines and the declaration of the walled city of Famagusta as a UNESCO world heritage monument as a key confidence-building measure.  I hope the EU and the Irish Government will take a more proactive approach to the issue, giving the Cypriot Government and the negotiators their full support.  Considering the history and current partition of our nation, I would like to see the Government play a much more supportive role in this regard.  Were any of the issues discussed with the Cypriot leadership at the meetings?<\/p><p>The Cypriot people will look to Ireland to take the lead, as it has in the past.<\/p><p> It is welcome that the Council discussed human rights, accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka and that its conclusions call for the adoption of a resolution on Sri Lanka at the Human Rights Council which would provide for an international investigation into alleged war crimes, as recommended by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The Sri Lankan Government has continually tried to dodge all calls for an independent international investigation into these crimes and continued abuses of Tamil citizens&rsquo; human rights.  I hope the Council and individual member states will place serious pressure on Sri Lanka and insist that it begin this investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600026#Y00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395841200,"counter":548,"content":"<p>There should be no ambiguity about our attitude to the Russian actions in Ukraine.  They should be condemned outright.  President Putin&rsquo;s regime is vile.  It has been involved in vicious repression of the Pussy Riot movement and gay people and carried on a terrible and brutal campaign of Russian imperialism in the smaller nations surrounding Russia which has earned it the title, Prison House of Nations, which it still deserves.  That imperial impulse is driving its actions in Ukraine.  Russia should get out, as President Putin has no credibility.<\/p><p>  The hypocrisy of the European Union and the Government in the assessment of the situation in Ukraine is equally nauseating.  The Taoiseach said, &ldquo;Europe and the world need stability based on the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.&rdquo;  Presumably, the violation of these principles justifies sanctions.  How can that be the case when, for example, Israel routinely, systematically, brutally and continually violates all of these principles and human rights, makes regular incursions into other sovereign states, affecting their territorial integrity, and Europe does not impose sanctions?  Palestinians and many others have called for sanctions, but instead the European Union gives it privileged trade status, the opposite of sanctions, despite its vile breach of the principles the Taoiseach says we must uphold.  That hypocrisy suggests this is not the real motive.  These principles are a cover for the European Union engaging in a geopolitical battle to try to expand its borders at the expense of another geopolitical rival and being willing to play around in the most dangerous way with vile right-wing and neo-fascist forces inside Ukraine.  There has been no outright condemnation of Svoboda and the Right Sector and all they stand for, in a worrying echo of what happened at the beginning of the First World War or Germany&rsquo;s unilateral actions which pre-empted the war in the Balkans in the mid-1990s.<\/p><p>  I will keep raising my next point until it is acknowledged.  Is there any discussion of social objectives in Europe, or this country, particularly homelessness, poverty and unemployment, in all of the discussions about banking union and bank resolution mechanisms?  Will the Government acknowledge and discuss with its European partners how property and housing are again being deployed as speculative commodities, stoking a property bubble here reminiscent of the one that led to the crash?  The banks and the Government are actively encouraging this with tax breaks for speculation, banks seizing properties to maximise their value and evicting people, leading to a crisis of homelessness.  What is the Government stating about the human impact or the macro-economic danger that represents? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600028#AA00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1395841200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>Two weeks ago the latest round of US-EU negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, took place in Brussels.  The lack of transparency in these talks is outrageous.  Negotiating documents and stakeholder contributions are not published; neither are the agendas nor minutes of meetings.  This is in stark contrast to public statements made about the talks by Commissioner De Gucht who wrote in <i>The Guardian<\/i> last December that &ldquo;There is nothing secret about the EU trade deal.  Our negotiations over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership are fully open to scrutiny...&rdquo;  Last month the Corporate Europe Observatory received 44 documents about the European Commission&rsquo;s meetings with industry lobbyists as part of preparations for the TTIP talks, 39 of which were heavily censored and released only after a freedom of information request submitted by the observatory almost ten months ago.  The documents show that Commissioner De Gucht's officials invited industry to submit wish lists for regulatory barriers they would like to be removed during the negotiations.  There is no way for the public to know how the European Union has incorporated this into its negotiating position or even what has been asked for and by whom, as all references have been removed.  Responding to the Commissioner&rsquo;s claims of openness and transparency, the organisation stated that, according to Global Research: <blockquote>Not only is the text of the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position secret the public is even denied access to sentences in meeting reports that refer to the EU negotiating position.  This is especially problematic as these are minutes from meetings with industry lobbyists who were clearly given information about the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position in the TTIP talks, unlike the public ... sharing information about the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position with industry while refusing civil society access to that same information is unacceptable discrimination.<\/blockquote>We can ascertain from the heavily censored documents released by the Commission that in advance of the TTIP talks it was extremely active in seeking guidance from big business and its lobbyists.  The documents also show that the major issue in the negotiations is the removal of differences in EU and US regulations.  As the Corporate European Observatory has highlighted, regulatory co-operation is one of the most worrying aspects of the TTIP talks and its repercussions will be felt long after the deal is concluded.  As George Monbiot of <i>The Guardian<\/i> pointed out recently: <blockquote>Nothing threatens democracy quite as much as corporate power ... When everything has been globalised except our consent, corporations fill the void.  In a system that governments have shown no interest in reforming, global power is often scarcely distinguishable from corporate power.  It is exercised through backroom deals between bureaucrats and lobbyists.<\/blockquote>I am no fan of what Russia does, any more than what the United States or China gets up to, but Russia has acted to protect what it sees as its security interests, just as the United States did in Cuba a long time ago.  International experts warned as far back as 2008 that if the United States and the European Union continued to encroach on Ukraine, there would be social and economic chaos, but NATO ignored such warnings and boasted that Georgia and Ukraine would become part of it.  The West seems to think it is always right, no matter what its stance.  I wish the people concerned would read history because they might learn something.  It was interesting to hear Mr. David Cameron launch his attack on Russia for having the audacity to invade a neighbouring state while he was coming back from a friendly visit to Israel.  When he was there, did he propose a plebiscite on the West Bank?  It might have been a good idea to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600028#AA00300","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1395841200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>It is difficult to concentrate on anything today other than Garda matters, but the issues under discussion are of critical importance.  We need to put the spotlight on the conduct of the European Union and how this country, as a neutral country, within a league of nations conducts itself.  We have to examine seriously the European Union&rsquo;s policy on Ukraine.  It has not been motivated by humanitarian concerns or democratic interests for the well-being of the people of Ukraine.  The conduct of the European Union has been based on an economic and political agenda directly competing with Russia&rsquo;s economic agenda.<\/p><p>The people of Ukraine will be the ones who suffer.  Like other Deputies, I find it nauseating to listen to western media cheer the coup against the corrupt former leader, Victor Yanukovych.  I have no sympathy for him but his demise was cheered not because he was corrupt but because it destabilised the region and allowed the advancement of the neoliberal agenda in Ukraine.  The same neoliberal agenda is riding roughshod across the EU.  It is ironic to hear the Taoiseach argue yesterday that all the people of Ukraine want is the right to join the EU in order to enjoy the same great living standards as the people of Poland.  Clearly he does not know many Polish people because living conditions in Poland are not worthy of applause.  The idea that Ukraine will be joining the EU is laughable because that will not offer a way out.  The fact that the new regime has installed its own oligarch shows it is not democratic and is putting the interests of a tiny elite ahead of the general population.<\/p><p> It is appropriate to condemn the hypocrisy of the EU and US in threatening sanctions.  We must be consistent in remembering these countries' history of undemocratic and bloody actions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Serbia and Kosovo.  The idea that the EU has somehow morphed into the great defender of human rights and borders is an insult to our intelligence.  When US interests are at stake it has no problem embarking on military interventions or invasions of sovereign territory.  The EU is engaging in doublespeak because it also wants to protect its economic interests in the Ukraine.  Some European powers are pulling back somewhat because of their concerns in this regard.  We are in a unique position as a neutral country to do something different.  Nobody in this House is a cheerleader for the rotten Putin regime but some of us would argue for consistency and putting the interests of the people of Ukraine at the heart of this discussion instead of the interests of multinationals, NATO and those who want to enrich themselves at the expense of the many.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600028#AA00400","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395841800,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I will begin by speaking in general about this House and the equality we were meant to enjoy when we came in here. \u00a0Yesterday the Technical Group was left out of a briefing on the issue of Garda bugging and today, as usual, the Taoiseach left the Chamber before Members from the Technical Group began to speak. \u00a0I am amazed that he remained for the contribution from the Sinn F&eacute;in Member.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600029#BB00200","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1395841800,"counter":553,"content":"<p>There is limited time for this debate and I ask the Deputy to refer to the subject matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600029#BB00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1395841800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>He rarely stays for contributions from Sinn F&eacute;in but he stays to listen to Fianna F&aacute;il. \u00a0We know why he does so given that he has a lot in common with that party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600029#BB00400","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1395841800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>If the Deputy wants to use his entire time this way he can do so but he is out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600029#BB00500","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1395841800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>He is not out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600029#BB00600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1395841800,"counter":557,"content":"<p>Everyone agrees that we should condemn Russia for what it has done in Crimea. \u00a0It is obvious that it will be a difficult situation for many people there. \u00a0However, when we consider who is condemning Russia it does not do a lot of good. \u00a0Deputy Martin referred earlier to the democratic principles of the EU. \u00a0In what EU has he been living?

That sets out clearly the concerns of the ECB on the funding position of the Irish banks.  Notwithstanding comments that are regularly made about the nature of the recovery that has taken place in the balance sheets of those banks, they are working through a considerable amount of distressed assets, and certain targets have been set by the Central Bank of Ireland in that regard.  What still seems to be at the core of all of this is the retrospective recapitalisation, and nothing that I have read and none of the comments that have been made, either by the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, or the Taoiseach, would lead me to believe that we are any closer to that position being resolved.  Clearly, it will be a requirement if the Government is serious about addressing the funding deficit that seems to exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600029#BB01900","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395842400,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I will respond to the different points the Deputies made.<\/p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about the property sector and what he believes is taking place with regard to property prices and the significant difficulties to do with homelessness.  He first asked me whether there was a European sphere of engagement on this topic.  I must emphasise that policy on the delivery of housing, whether it be social housing or planning policy overall in the development of private accommodation, is nearly entirely a matter of national competence for governments.  Decisions on areas of planning and public housing are made at national Government level as opposed to decisions that require engagement or consent from other Governments or from European bodies.<\/p><p>  I note that Deputy Boyd Barrett went on to rephrase the question in the context of macroeconomic imbalances.  Of course, the Deputy is correct to note that the fiscal governance treaty and the European Semester process make reference to macroeconomic imbalances, a macroeconomic imbalance being a development within an economy that could have a seismic effect on either the health of the economy or society itself.  In terms of engagement with Europe on whether what is happening in the property market represents a macroeconomic imbalance, I would argue that it does not.  The reason I say so is that the property price increases are happening in the context of prices - for example, in Dublin - having come down by nearly 51% from their peak.  It is also happening in the context of a property market that does not have as many properties available for sale as would be the case in a normal housing market, which, hopefully, will develop in the coming period.  As to whether I believe the increase in house prices is a cause of the homelessness problem, I would argue it is the lack of housing supply that is more a direct cause of homelessness than the changes of price in the housing stock, and that is something to which the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Dublin City Council are responding.  I am aware of the work they are doing in my constituency in that area.<\/p><p>  On the point Deputy Dooley put to me regarding the different approaches at the European summit in dealing with Crimea and Ukraine, different views were articulated in public on how a response of this magnitude should be dealt with, but I would emphasise, before I come to the Irish response, that there was complete unity from all the Governments - Deputy Martin acknowledged this in his statement - regarding the measures that were agreed at the European Council.  Everybody agreed with the plans that were in place and the overall framework that Europe has for dealing with this issue.<\/p><p>  In terms of where Ireland was specifically in relation to this, Ireland supported the expansion of the phase two list - in other words, the subjecting of further individuals to the measures of which the House will be aware - and supported the work that the Commission is now doing to scope out possible measures for broader action and the cost and benefits of those different approaches.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Dooley's concluding point with regard to the banking sector, I re-emphasise that due to the investment that has already been made in the banks by the Irish taxpayer, the Government is strongly of the belief that the banking sector is capitalised and is able to deal with the difficulties that we know are still there.  I point to the fact that some of the banks have been more successful in selling their own bonds, which would indicate that those who are looking to invest in those banks hold the same view as they look to buy that debt.<\/p><p>  On his point regarding retrospective recapitalisation, to be clear, it was due to decisions that were made by the previous Government, led by his party, that we have difficulties of this scale.  The Taoiseach has been clear that in the context of a banking union that will be operational within the next 12 to 18 months, we will look at all measures to get value back for the Irish taxpayer in the banking system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600030#CC00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1395842400,"counter":572,"content":"<p>Mr. Jim Higgins, MEP, made an announcement on local radio - I brought this up on the last occasion and I am curious about where he is getting this information - that before the next general election there would be a deal on retrospective bank recapitalisation.

I wonder whether the Minister of State ever brings up the reports that &euro;4.5 billion of the previous CAP funding was not spent on-farm but off-farm.  It was spent on buy-to-let apartments in Ireland and on apartments in Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, etc.  Given that we are coming close to finalising the latest round of CAP, I wonder what is being done to ensure that such funding is not spent yet again on what it should not be spent on.

First, the Minister of State did not respond on the contrast between Europe's apparent concern in Ukraine to uphold territorial integrity and sovereignty as a fundamental principle, which is what the Taoiseach stated, and its absolute failure to do that in relation to Palestine.  In fact, these are starkly contrasting approaches.  One country gets sanctioned for breaching those principles while another country gets favourable trade status, not sanctions, despite repeated calls for sanctions.  I would like to hear a comment on that.<\/p><p> I accept there is another dimension to property and it concerns housing policy, which we will take up elsewhere.  There is a major macroeconomic dimension at national and European levels and it is often forgotten in intricate discussions about European economic architecture that property was at the heart of the crash across Europe and the United States.  For us not to see the issue as a central consideration when looking at the question of macroeconomic imbalances or potential warning bells about developing imbalances is crazy yet I do not hear talk about it.  I ask for this to begin to feature in our discussions.  Is there any discussion about whether property-based tax reliefs, encouraging speculation in property, are inherently dangerous?<\/p><p> I see a link between the failure to look at the problem and the imperative of the EU, which the Government has adopted, to say that the banks must restore as much value from the distressed assets as possible.

I did not answer questions about Ukraine because he did not put such questions to me.  Now that he has, I will respond to that point.<\/p><p>  With regard to property, I refer to a point I made earlier.  Do I believe house price increases at the moment constitute a macroeconomic imbalance?  I do not believe so because house price increases are happening in the context of a gigantic decrease in house prices since 2007.  As other parts of our economy begin to strengthen, additional houses and, depending on the area, apartments will be made available to further deal with the price increases.  What is the bigger cause of homelessness at the moment - a lack of housing or the increasing price of housing stock available?  I believe it is a lack of housing.<\/p><p>  An earlier point dealt with the social consequences of this crisis.  I do not need to tell Deputy Boyd Barrett about the social catastrophe and the tens of thousands of people who had been working in a construction sector that got far too big.  Just because we had a construction sector that was far too big in our history does not mean that an economy and a country of our size should not have a smaller and better regulated construction sector that is able to deal with housing needs of the people to whom the Deputy refers.  While that is being created, I do not believe the housing market as currently constituted represents an imbalance.  <\/p><p>  On Ukraine and the contrast made with the Middle East, the European Union, through High Representative Ashton and many foreign Ministers, has been to the fore in bringing a just settlement to the Middle East.  It has done all it can to support the development of the peace talks, which hopefully will pick up momentum to deal with the many issues of injustice referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Sean Crowe's question on Cyprus, there was a discussion of Cyprus at the European Council.  The view of the European Union, shared by Ireland, is that the division of Cyprus has taken place for too long.  We welcome the discussions taking place and emphasise the need for more momentum.  I understand the role Turkey must play in that respect.  The Taoiseach joined his counterparts in emphasising our support for the UN framework and for the achievement of a successful outcome of the negotiations under way.<\/p><p>  In terms of climate change and whether there is a focus on this at the Council meeting, the Deputy is aware that it formed a substantial part of the conclusions that emerged from the Council.  Progress has been made in Europe in dealing with the climate change emissions that are causing such harm to our environment.  In 2012, we saw greenhouse gas emissions decrease by 18% relative to 1990.  They are expected to reduce further by between a quarter and just under a third between 2020 and 2030.<\/p><p>  With regard to Ukraine and inclusive political arrangements, the Deputy has picked up on what I believe is one of the key concepts in the engagement of the European Union with Ukraine.  This point also applies to the contributions of Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace.  It is essential that an inclusive, fair and legally and legitimately elected government be elected by the people of Ukraine.  Unless there is an inclusive government properly constituted under Ukrainian law, the difficulties in respect of minorities and upholding human values will become more fraught.  That is why the Union has always emphasised the need for inclusive political arrangements and a democratically elected government.<\/p><p>  On the question about Permanent TSB, the Minister for Finance can directly answer it through the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on finance, Deputy Pearse Doherty.  The Department of Finance will continue to work on the matter in its efforts to restore health to our banking system.<\/p><p>  Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan asked about agriculture policy and whether I raise agriculture matters when representing Ireland at the General Affairs Council.

Deputies are aware of the 6 million jobs lost in Europe.  Just under 4 million of those jobs have been lost in manufacturing, which is a gigantic share of employment loss.  I am encouraged by the growing momentum in the area of re-shoring, where manufacturing jobs that went to lower cost economies all over the world are now beginning to come back to Europe.  There are greater opportunities for the jobs to come back to Ireland.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Secretary of State, Vincent Cable, MP, recently published a joint article on this point.  There is a major opportunity for Ireland in the context of the hundreds of thousands of people we want to support getting back to work.<\/p><p>The European Council's conclusions make reference to a number of decisions on supporting industrial policy in Ireland and Europe and to doing all we can to ensure the overall recovery is built with a stronger contribution from industry and manufacturing.  They make reference to further progress in the areas of the Single Market and external trade.  Reference is also made to what needs to be done to ensure the banking system is able and has the right capacity to lend to small and medium-sized enterprises.  In addition, reference is made to what more needs to be done to put in place strong networks to support the development and commercialisation of research and development in Ireland and across Europe.  In considering all of these points we must ensure there are no artificial distinctions for different parts of the economy and the services sector.  The reality is that successful participation in value chains all over the world increasingly requires the use and development of business services to ensure progress and work in the area of manufacturing can lead to good jobs and their contribution to economic growth.<\/p><p> A further point concerns the progress made in the regulatory fitness and performance, REFIT, policy, something the European Commission has adopted in recent months.  It is about ensuring the levels of regulation within the European economy and inside the European Union are appropriate and that unnecessary proposals are withdrawn.<\/p><p> I wish to conclude with some comments on the EU-Africa summit and the discussion that took place on the situation in Sri Lanka.  The Taoiseach will attend the fourth annual EU-Africa summit which will take place in Brussels next week.  The theme of the summit will be &quot;Investing in People, Prosperity and Peace&quot;.  It will form an essential part of the Africa-EU strategy.  This is a great opportunity for Ireland and Europe to reiterate that we remain committed to building a partnership of equals with Africa.  What the European Council's conclusions stress is that continued international support for African partners in the area of security continues to be vital but that further work needs to be done to support African countries as they seek to increase their capacity and develop their ability to govern their people and communities well.  Ireland will intervene in the summit next week.  The particular areas on which we will focus will be sustainable and inclusive growth, specifically agriculture and food security.<\/p><p> On several occasions the European Union and Ireland have articulated their strong concerns about human rights in Sri Lanka and urged the Government of Sri Lanka to implement effectively the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission.  In last week's conclusions the European Council called for the adoption of a resolution on Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council that would provide for an international investigation into serious human rights abuses by both sides in Sri Lanka&rsquo;s civil war, as recommended by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

While this is a positive and welcome step, no real detail seems to have been given as to how these write-downs were achieved.  In highlighting this issue I do not want in any way to jeopardise any possible deal being done or that may be struck for individuals, as I understand the situation is extremely stressful.  However, there is a need for clarity on how these deals are negotiated.  The lender has chosen to remain silent on some of them which has caused resentment and angst among those who cannot obtain a similar deal and among taxpayers who are required to finance the deals through their taxes.  I understand negotiations can never take place in public.  However, it is important that deals are struck, but it is also important that they be as transparent as possible.  I have constituents who are at a loss to understand how some individuals have been able to attain deals and they cannot, even though they consider themselves to be in an equally serious position.  It seems some of the deals have been leaked to the media, but I do not understand how that helps the situation.  <\/p><p>  AIB is 99.8% owned by the taxpayer.  Therefore, it has a duty to the State and the taxpayer to be fair and transparent.  There has been selective leaking of deals to the media, which is not acceptable.  We do not know the specific criteria used.<\/p><p>We have information from some sources which seem to be in the employment of AIB but I could be incorrect about this.  The danger in reporting these deals to the media without relevant information as to how they were negotiated is that it leads to a false expectation among other borrowers.  On this basis there is an urgent need for clarification.  It is like a game of \"Deal or No Deal\".  The debtor simply fills out the standard financial statement, AIB examines it through its own process and determines whether it will give the person a deal.  I have been informed it applies the minimum standards as determined by the Insolvency Service of Ireland plus 20%.  It then writes off the proportion over 130% of the current market value.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland was established for a reason, which is in the interest of the debtor.  It is fair, open and transparent.  Could AIB's present approach impact negatively on the Insolvency Service of Ireland and on the personal insolvency service as a whole?<\/p><p> Is it the case the banks apply guidelines and criteria to benefit themselves and not the debtor or taxpayer?  It is clear the banks do not want to engage with the regulated solutions as set down by the Personal Insolvency Act as they stand to lose out.  I call for these details to be clarified and for transparency in respect of all deals.  Consistency needs to be applied across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600033#FF00300","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395844200,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Phelan for raising this very important issue.  As the Deputy will be aware the relationship framework with the bank provides the State cannot intervene in the day-to-day operations of the bank or its management decisions.  These frameworks are published on the Department of Finance's website.  The Minister for Finance must ensure AIB is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State.<\/p><p>  I understand AIB is acutely aware of its fiduciary duty to protect taxpayers' money and can only write down residual debt if there is no prospect of that debt being paid back or no affordability to pay it back.  From the bank's perspective, it is not possible or practical to set out absolutely strict guidelines on applicable levels of write-down as each case is different and circumstances vary from customer to customer.  However, once it has been determined a customer's level of net disposable income does not allow for a standard forbearance solution, it is sometimes necessary and economically sensible to involve debt compromise as part of the overall resolution.  This debt flexibility usually arises in the application of a split mortgage or a voluntary sale for loss arrangement.  All resolutions offered to customers in difficulty are assessed on the basis of the borrower's maximum affordability in respect of his or her mortgage.<\/p><p>  The approach of the Government on this issue has been clear, and it is that mortgage holders and other borrowers who can meet their loan obligations should continue to do so and that appropriate assistance should only be afforded to those mortgage holders, or other borrowers, who experience real and genuine difficulty in meeting their commitments.  This approach was recommended by the Keane report, which recommended against blanket debt write-off on affordability and distributional grounds.  It is clear the vast majority of mortgage holders can and will continue to meet their mortgage commitments.<\/p><p>  The Government's strategy to assist those in genuine and significant mortgage difficulty is built around measures in four distinct areas.  These are personal insolvency, which the Deputy mentioned, a mortgage advisory service, the mortgage to rent scheme, and engagement with the banks.  Considerable progress has been achieved across this strategy.  This strategy is being managed across several Departments and reflects the fact there is no single solution to the mortgage arrears problem.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears, the CCMA, also provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure borrowers struggling to keep up their mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long-term solutions are sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The CCMA provides an integrated package of consumer protection measures for borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears.  It seeks to deliver on the following principles: to ensure appropriate resolution of each borrower's arrears situation, to ensure lenders deal with borrowers in a fair way, to support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers and to ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of co-operating with the lender and the consequences of not co-operating.<\/p><p>  In its mortgage arrears resolution targets, or MART process, the Central Bank has set clear targets to require the main mortgage lenders to propose and conclude sustainable solutions to mortgages which are more than 90 days in arrears.  However, the appropriate solution in each individual case is one for the bank and lender to conclude having regard to the particular circumstances involved.  So far, lenders have reported to the Central Bank they have met the quarter two and quarter three targets for 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600034#GG00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1395844200,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I accept the comprehensive answer the Minister of State has given.

Does he accept this causes resentment not only among debtors but in society in general?<\/p><p>  I accept the bank will have to do individual deals with people but we must level the playing field.  I have constituents who have been trying to deal with a bank other than AIB who cannot get anywhere.  Their phone calls are not returned.  They keep a diary of how they try to contact the bank.  The bank will not engage with them and has told them to surrender their home.

It would bring some clarity to the issue.<\/p><p>  These issues will only be resolved on a case-by-case basis and it will depend on the level of indebtedness.  My understanding from the Department of Finance's perspective is we are only speaking about people in personal dwellings and it does not involve investment properties.  This is an important message to send out.<\/p><p>  When the Government had to recapitalise the banks, provision was made for this and there was always going to be a circumstance where some form of partial write-down would have to be part of the mix of solutions, depending on the indebtedness of individuals and the circumstances, and whether in a forbearance test they were able to pay back in a circumstance where a solution could be found.  The task of the Government has been to get onto the banks to get this done.  Clear targets have been set by the Central Bank as I stated in my remarks.  It is now the task of the banks to achieve these targets.  This is the focus of the Government.  There was always going to be a mix of solutions.<\/p><p>However, I accept the point the Deputy raises that for those who are trying to get a workable solution to the banks and who then hear willy-nilly of what I understand to be a small number of cases, in which some kind of debt write-down has been given as part of the solution, a more substantive statement by the bank or possibly the bank's involvement in a parliamentary committee setting out the circumstances would be of general assistance.  The point made by Deputy Ann Phelan is absolutely on the money.  People need to know these things and customers who are dealing with the bank and who are having difficulty in arriving at a solution also need to hear this.

I am sure the Minister is aware a new study has found that Ireland has the third highest cost of broadband in the European Union when making comparisons in respect of the cheapest package available.  The research was carried out by the European Commission last year and examined comparative costs of broadband across the European Union.  The study, carried out by SamKnows, found that Irish consumers who get their broadband using xDSL technology only receive 49.9% of the speeds advertised by their Internet service provider, which is well below the European Union average of 71% of the advertised speeds.  I have raised this issue a number of times, both in this Chamber and in committees and so on.  This finding is shocking and the Minister will remember that I tabled an amendment to the ESB (Electronic Communications Networks) Bill 2013 to deal with this issue, which was rejected at the time.<\/p><p>  The survey found out that the Irish consumer pays a minimum of &euro;31.40 per month for broadband up to a maximum of slightly more than &euro;60 per month, which ranks as the third highest in the European Union.  Surprisingly, within the European Union's Internal Market, the research found a 400% variation in price between the cheapest and most expensive broadband packages, underlining the variable nature of broadband charges.  For a country such as Ireland, which prides itself on being at the cutting-edge of technology in the world, this is not good news as it has an impact.  Services such as broadband are increasingly necessary and are essential to carry out business and to compete on a commercial level and the cost of such services affects how consumers act.  The high cost of broadband will restrict people from moving to e-commerce and e-services.  Another survey carried out by Eurobarometer found that approximately three quarters of people living in Ireland limit calls made on their mobile telephones to national numbers and numbers in other European Union states as a result of the charges.  The study also found that approximately 70% of people in Ireland limit their fixed line calls to other European Union countries and mobile or fixed line networks run by other operators, due to concerns about charges.  In a European Union that espouses the Single Market, this is most disappointing.  The Minister should be working to end these charges as soon as possible and should support any action to so do in the European Parliament.<\/p><p>  As for the cost of broadband in Ireland, as I stated during the debate on the aforementioned Bill, I accept and welcome the entry of the ESB into the market.  This should increase competition in the broadband and electronic communications markets, which hopefully will result in reduced costs and increased broadband coverage throughout the country, although I am not certain whether it will extend to those areas that are devoid of broadband coverage at present.  I ask the Minister to outline his thoughts as to the reason broadband in Ireland is so expensive.  He also might outline the actions he will take in future to try to bring down the cost, as well as outlining what he intends to do to ensure that Irish consumers get the service for which they are paying, that is, the service that is being advertised.  I assure the Minister that my party will be supportive of any measures he might outline to bring about better and lower-cost broadband, as well as a better service of broadband throughout the communities to make sure that businesses and homes in Ireland have a proper broadband service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600035#HH00300","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1395844800,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I am grateful to Deputy Moynihan for giving me the opportunity to address the House on this matter.  As the Deputy is aware, Ireland's telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999.  This means that retail price fixing for deregulated services is not permitted.  Governments can, however, establish an investment environment that promotes an active competitive market.  Hopefully, this will in turn improve the quality of services and place downward pressure on retail prices.  Moreover, the commercial broadband market has made progress, with the number of broadband subscribers increasing from 600,000 to more than 1.6 million within five years.  Increasingly, consumers are opting for bundled services from a single provider.  These now account for more than 50% of all fixed-line subscriptions.  Moreover, smart phone adoption is continuing to increase, with an increase of more than 16% recorded last year.  In the fixed-line broadband market, customers are moving from lower to higher broadband speeds, where available.<\/p><p>  It remains the case that many towns, villages and communities are not seeing similar progress.  Ireland's widely dispersed population means there are some areas in which it simply is not viable for the commercial sector to provide services.  In August 2012, I launched the national broadband plan to change radically the broadband landscape by ensuring that high-speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by encouraging the commercial markets to do so where the business case is present and by establishing a State-led investment for areas in which it is not commercially viable for the market to invest.  Since publication of the plan, investments by the commercial sector are under way in both fixed-line and wireless high-speed broadband services.  For example, Eircom has plans to pass 1.4 million addresses with its next-generation broadband service, while UPC has increased its entry-level and maximum speeds to 120 Mbps and 200 Mbps, respectively.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Moynihan noted, recent legislation to facilitate the ESB's entry into the telecommunications market also can help the roll-out of high-speed broadband, as well as facilitating greater competition.  Intensive work continues in my Department in respect of the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next-generation broadband access.  By implementing the national broadband plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high-speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally-enabled society.  The plan will ensure that a combination of commercial and State-led investment delivers access to high-speed broadband service to all as quickly as possible.  Therefore, competing service providers and informed customers moving across providers to secure the best value will exercise the required downward pressure on retail prices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600035#HH00400","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1395844800,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire.

The cost of broadband must be considered and one must ensure the service providers are competitive in comparison with other European Union countries.  However, people everywhere throughout the country are telling me about one single broadband-related issue, which pertains to young people in education.  For example, one primary school lacks a broadband service and its pupils are greatly disadvantaged when they go on to second level, which makes use of interactive broadband and so forth.

I thank the Minister for his presence and I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this issue.  <\/p><p>  I am concerned that some of my constituents in Dublin Bay North and people on the northside of Dublin are not able to access fast and consistent broadband services.  Residents in Bettyglen, Maywood and on the Howth Road in Raheny, Dublin 5 have contacted me about the poor quality broadband available to them, with many only having access to speeds of less than 3 Mbps.  This is as a result of a delay in the roll-out of fibre-optic broadband in the area by eircom.  As we know, Raheny is less than 5 km from the city centre, yet the broadband speeds available are extremely poor, prevent people from doing business from home and affect students in their education and access to the Internet.  A constituent who is running a small business from his home has developed an online presence.  He has told me he frequently works in and travels to Africa and that there faster broadband speeds in Malawi than in his home in Raheny.  The delay has been caused by the refusal of Dublin City Council to grant a licence to eircom to construct an additional cabinet at the junction of Maywood Road and Maywood Grove in order to provide for a fibre-optic upgrade for Internet users in Bettyglen.  I ask the Minister to intervene to ensure all councils work with providers - eircom in this case - to resolve these matters.  Constituents are not getting answers from Internet providers, including eircom, UPC or Sky, on whether improved speeds will be available in the area soon.  As Deputy Michael Moynihan said, people are continuing to pay very high monthly subscriptions - in this case, to eircom - for a poor service, while neighbours living a few roads away have a much better and speedier service.<\/p><p>  Eircom informed me recently that while the area was set to receive eFibre services, it did not have a date for the provision of services.  It states this is because of the uncertainty surrounding the placement of cabinets and the provision of electricity.  Obviously, a compromise has to be reached on the provision of infrastructure to ensure customers receive a better service.  Constituents in Howth, particularly on Windgate Road, where speeds of no more than 100 kbps are available, are concerned that they are not able to access the same service as neighbours on adjoining roads.  These are professionals who are looking to do business and students who are trying to access various websites for educational purposes.  I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that there are pockets in Dublin where there is a lack of services, which is very unfair.  I very much welcome his response to the previous Topical Issue about the national broadband plan and the aim to ensure high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, but there are issues and pockets where there are problems and I am glad to have the opportunity to highlight them directly with him.  I know the State will only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services, but in this case a council is refusing to give planning permission for the provision of cabinets.  I do not know if there is a section in the Minister's Department which would be able to deal with these very real issues in different parts of Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600036#JJ00300","speaker":"1182"},{"type":"speech","time":1395845400,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I welcome the Deputy ventilating this issue.  I did not know from the Topical Issue raised, which refers to the northside of Dublin, that he was referring specifically to Bettyglen and a couple of black spots in Howth, where Gay Byrne goes for a walk.  If the Deputy tables particular parliamentary questions to me, I will see what I can do.<\/p><p>  The northside of Dublin is, in many ways, a state of mind and, generally, is immensely well provided for in terms of the provision of broadband, but the Deputy is right that there are gaps.  The eircom programme for the roll-out of eFibre, to which the Deputy referred, is especially exciting.  As he knows, fibre-optic is the Rolls Royce of the system.  Eircom is getting on with the task and committed to passing 1.4 million homes.  I cannot tell the Deputy off the top of my head what the delay in roll-out is in the case of Bettyglen, but I can have a look at the matter and he can also pursue it by way of parliamentary questions.<\/p><p>  The Deputy has acknowledged that the State is not a service provider in this market and can only intervene in cases where there is a demonstrable market failure.  A great deal of progress has been made and the national broadband plan is a clear expression of the importance of ubiquitous quality broadband to the achievement of our economic and social objectives.  The Deputy has referred to the fact that some business people are hampered in the particular areas about which he is concerned.  Our commitment is to deliver high speed or next generation broadband services across the country by ensuring the environment is right to maximise investment by the private sector and by State-led investment in those areas where it is evident that the market will not deliver.<\/p><p>  Since publication of the plan, fixed line and wireless telecommunications providers have accelerated the roll-out of high speed services.  The landscape for quality broadband provision, in particular in urban areas, including Dublin, has changed dramatically as a consequence.  There have been a number of significant developments, for example, the programme to which the Deputy referred, eircom's eFibre programme.  New technology is allowing eircom to deliver speeds of up to 100 Mbps.  Some 700,000 premises can now avail of its next generation broadband services.<\/p><p>I understand that Eircom has rolled out high-speed broadband services in a great many areas of north Dublin, or rather, northside Dublin.  Eircom also advises that it is planning to offer high-speed services in Clontarf, Santry, Summerhill, Phibsboro and some smaller rural communities in north County Dublin, which I suspect are some of the black spot areas about which Deputy Flanagan is concerned.  UPC is also investing in the network.  Almost 700,000 homes now have access to its fibre-enabled cable services and this is set to grow to 750,000.  It has a wide footprint in the Dublin area and more than 43% of Irish homes can now access the UPC network.  Mobile operators are rolling out enhanced product offerings, with Meteor, 3 and Vodafone having recently launched 4G mobile broadband services which are capable of delivering significantly higher mobile data speeds.  Vodafone is also upgrading its 3G services.  Sky has entered the broadband market, offering services over the unbundled Eircom network and providing intense competition in the marketplace, which is also driving investment.  Fixed wireless broadband providers are also providing dedicated broadband services to customers.  Earlier, Deputy Moynihan referred to the initiative we have taken with the ESB in a joint venture with a leading telecommunications company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600036#JJ00400","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395846000,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his thorough response.

There is also a problem in certain neighbourhoods with the speed available on one road being far superior to that on adjoining roads.  In those circumstances, people feel they are paying a high price but are not receiving the same level of service.  That must be dealt with.<\/p><p>  Does the Minister have an indicative date for Eircom's plans to roll out the eFibre programme?

It is a big success that it is maintaining that investment programme and maintaining the commitment to roll out its fibre network to more than 1.4 million homes.  UPC now has a very large footprint, including in Deputy Flanagan's part of Dublin.  I made reference to the mobile providers as well.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is correct to point out that each member state of the European Union is different.

I have raised this issue on a number of occasions by way of parliamentary questions, because the current system is casting a cloud over many thriving rural communities which fear the devastating effect that a loss of a teacher would have on them.  We cannot compare rural and urban schools either in geographical terms or in terms of their importance in underpinning the social and economic fabric of communities.  The fact is that if the local school closes in a rural area, parents have to transport their children up to ten miles to attend an alternative school, and that rips the heart out of the community.  We could avoid this disruption for schools and communities if the pupil-teacher ratio for rural schools were less punitive and if the system took account of specific circumstances and fluctuations in population.<\/p><p>  Such a unique circumstance has arisen at Labasheeda national school, which is located in a rural parish in west Clare in my own constituency.  The two-teacher school is to lose one of its teachers from September 2014.  It has been through the appeals process but its appeal has been unsuccessful.  The decrease in the school's enrolment is not based on demographics.  It is a unique situation, which I have outlined separately to the Minister, in which extraordinary circumstances led to the reduction in numbers currently attending the school.  However, while enrolment figures fell during the turmoil, the future is far more positive.  The school has signed pre-enrolment forms from parents for the next five years, which shows their commitment to the school and confirms that the school can reverse the decline.  The whole-school evaluation, WSE, report from 2012 indicates high standards and a parental survey shows there is overwhelming support for the work being done at the school.  If Labasheeda national school is reduced to a one-teacher school, it will mean the remaining teacher will be expected to deliver the full curriculum to eight different grades.  Similar problems arise in other rural one-teacher schools.  As well at the issue of the curriculum, the question arises as to how the teacher is going to manage the school alone.  Recently, another rural school that is losing a teacher was in touch with me and I have put the case to the Department for providing a classroom assistant in the interests of health and safety.<\/p><p>  This week, by way of parliamentary question, I also raised the issue of small rural schools, and I thank the Minister for this response.  I understand from the reply that the configuration of small primary schools has been examined by the Department in a value for money review and that this review will inform future policy direction in this area.  In my view, future policy direction for small rural schools cannot be based solely on pounds, shillings and pence.  It must take into consideration the social and economic value of these schools and their importance to their communities.  It is clear from reports I read in an article in the <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>this week that while the number of primary school mergers doubled last year, most did not involve small rural schools.  Merging is simply not an option for small rural schools, as they are geographically isolated with no access to public transport.  <\/p><p>  I ask that the Minister publish the aforementioned review as a priority so that we can have a debate on this very important issue.  In the meantime, I ask him to give Labasheeda national school a break.  It needs the breathing space to allow it recover from what has been a very difficult time in its history.  What is the point in taking away one of the mainstream teachers from September when 12 months down the line it will have the numbers to re-engage that teacher?  That makes no sense and it will only cause unnecessary disruption for the school and for the community of Labasheeda.  I ask the Minister to relax the policy criteria to take account of such special cases.  Labasheeda national school will recover provided it is given the opportunity to do so, and I ask the Minister to take account of this unique situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600037#KK00400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1395846600,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.<\/p><p>  The staffing schedule is the mechanism used for allocating mainstream teaching posts to all schools.  It operates in a clear and transparent manner, treating all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location, and on the basis of a general average of one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS band one schools.  As part of the 2012 budget decisions, there is a phased increase in the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools with four teachers or fewer.  The first phase of the budget measure took effect from September 2012 while the final phase will take effect from September 2014.<\/p><p>  Labasheeda national school has two classroom teachers in the current school year based on an enrolment of 21 pupils at 30 September 2012.  The enrolment at 30 September 2013 was 17 pupils which entitles the school to one classroom teacher for the coming school year.  The school is projecting an enrolment of 16 pupils for 30 September 2014.  The school submitted an appeal to the February 2014 meeting of the primary staffing appeals board, under the small school criterion, seeking the retention of its second classroom post for the 2014-2015 school year based on the projected enrolment of 16 pupils at 30 September 2014.  A projected enrolment of at least 20 pupils on 30 September 2014 would be required for the school to remain as a two-teacher school.<\/p><p>  Given that it projected just 16 pupils, the appeal was deemed ineligible for consideration by the board on the basis that the grounds of the appeal did not meet with the appeal criteria.  The board of management of the school has been notified of this decision.  The appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  If other pupils decide to enrol in the school and its projected enrolment in September 2014 increases to the required 20 pupils, then it can submit a new appeal to the appeals board.<\/p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.

I have looked again at the information provided to me and considered the matter in detail.  I previously stated on the D&aacute;il record that I expected that Sergeant McCabe would be interviewed during the course of the O'Mahoney investigation and I note that he fully engaged with the Garda Inspectorate in the work undertaken by it to prepare the report which is the subject matter of today's debate.<\/p><p>  I want to say very clearly that, having re-examined the facts and further considered the matter, I believe more should have been done during the course of the O'Mahoney investigation to obtain information from and ascertain the views and experiences of the whistleblowers.

If any upset was caused, I hope that my correcting the record of the D&aacute;il today will put this matter to rest.  In doing so, I again acknowledge, as I have done many times previously that the reports published and the findings and recommendations that have been made with regard to the fixed notice charge system and penalty points are in response to the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe and supported by former Garda Wilson.<\/p><p>  I am aware that the whistleblowers and others have issues with some remarks I made outside this House.  It was not my intention to misrepresent any matter connected with this issue.  I apologise for any offence that may have been caused by any other remarks made by me.  There are issues of importance that I have to properly address as Minister for Justice and Equality.  There are important matters outstanding which I hope will be finally resolved upon the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, completing its investigation and publishing its report.<\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that the House today has made time to discuss the Garda Inspectorate report on the fixed charge processing system.  I commissioned that report on 14 May 2013 as part of a series of measures to make sure not only that the whistleblower allegations were properly addressed but that any other problems with the fixed charge processing system would also be tackled.<\/p><p>  Prior to that, in September 2012, detailed allegations were received by my Department from both the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport relating to the fixed charge processing system.  In October 2012, having considered these allegations, I initially furnished them to the Garda Commissioner for his response.<\/p><p>  I believed this was the appropriate initial step and it resulted in an investigation led by the Garda assistant commissioner John O'Mahoney and the administration of the fixed charge processing system being examined by the Garda professional standards unit, GPSU.  In the context of the O'Mahoney-led investigation, the particular notices, subject to allegations by Sergeant McCabe, were examined, as well as a random further 1% of fixed charge notice terminations.  I published both the report of assistant commissioner O'Mahoney and the GPSU report on 15 May 2013 and referred both of them to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for its consideration.<\/p><p>As already mentioned, the day before their publication I referred them also to the Garda Inspectorate, which performs an independent statutory role, and subsequently agreed with the inspectorate broad terms of reference to facilitate it conducting a comprehensive examination of the fixed charge processing system to enable it to make all necessary recommendations to ensure its proper administration.<\/p><p> It was my view at all times, and remains my view today, that any use of Garda discretion to effect the termination of fixed charge notices must be applied in a fair, impartial and transparent manner and on 15 May 2013, I published seven crucial applicable principles to ensure this.  They are as follows: 1. There must be no question mark hanging over the integrity of the fixed charge notice system and in the application of penalty points; 2. No individual should receive preferential treatment because of his or her perceived status, relationship or celebrity; 3. The law and any discretionary application of it to individuals must be administered fairly and with compassion and common sense; 4. No member of the Garda should feel compelled by a person's position, relationship or celebrity status to treat that person any more or less favourably than any other person; 5. There must be proper oversight and transparency to the discretionary decision making process and the applicable rules and procedures must be fully complied with; 6. All statutory provisions, regulations, rules, protocols and procedures applicable to the termination of fixed charge notices must be readily accessible to all members of the Garda and the circumstances, factors and procedures applicable to the termination of fixed charge notices should be detailed clearly on the Garda website for the information of members of the public; and, 7. Where application is made to terminate a fixed ticket charge, where possible and appropriate, material to support any application made should be sought while understanding in some circumstances no such material may exist or be obtainable.  These principles were applied by the Garda Inspectorate and they are detailed in the appendix to its report.<\/p><p> I note that, at the time of publication of both the O'Mahoney report and the PSU report, Deputy Niall Collins informed this House that he had no issue with the two reports.  Deputy Collins stated:<blockquote>In the first instance, I will refer to the two reports that were published last week regarding penalty points and the allegations of erasing penalty points.  We have no issue with those reports.  We welcome the finding that there was no corruption.<\/blockquote>I believe that, on the facts as I have outlined them, any objective observer would conclude that I took all the allegations made seriously and that speedy and appropriate action was taken to address them.<\/p><p> I think it is obvious that if I had ignored the allegations made, there would have been no O'Mahoney report, no PSU report and we would not today be discussing the Garda Inspectorate report.  If I had ignored the allegations made, the changes effected to improve the management and administration of the system and to provide for more regular auditing would not have been put in place after 15 May 2013 and prior to the publication of the Garda Inspectorate's report.  If I had ignored the allegations made, I would not have asked for the comprehensive examination undertaken by the Garda Inspectorate, whose terms of reference addressed issues that were additional to those addressed in the O'Mahoney report and I would not have recommended to Government that all 37 recommendations contained in the Garda Inspectorate report be accepted and steps taken to implement them, nor would I have published an action plan to bring about their implementation.<\/p><p> If I had not taken the allegations seriously, the criminal justice working group, which the inspectorate recommended be established to oversee implementation of the changes required, would not have met the day immediately following publication of the inspectorate's report.  It should be noted that, in a slight variation of the inspectorate's recommendation, rather than the group being solely chaired by an official from my Department, I proposed, and it was agreed, that the group would be co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I believe that is in the public interest as each Department has a separate and complementary role on dealing with road traffic issues.  I am pleased to also note that the DPP has now agreed to be represented on the group.<\/p><p> The action plan which I published, together with the inspectorate's report, prescribes a timescale for the implementation of the recommendations made and also noted where action had already been taken or commenced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement some of the recommendations.  In this regard, a number of the recommendations reflected changes which had already been made as a result of the report by Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney and the parallel report by the PSU.<\/p><p> The report we are discussing today deals with all aspects of the fixed charge processing system and not just the issues raised by Garda whistleblowers in regard to the use of Garda discretion.  Some of the failings identified relate to matters other than the use by garda&iacute; of their discretionary powers to terminate fixed charge notices and penalty points.  It is important that we keep in context the extent of the difficulty in regard to the use by the Garda of this discretion.  The inspectorate's report notes that, in 2011, there were 514,959 fixed charge notices issued.  Some 4.4% of these, that is 22,781, were cancelled.  In 2012, some 449,403 notices were issued and 4.8% of these, that is 21,960, were cancelled.  In 2013, some 393,588 fixed charge notices were issued and 4.4%, that is 17,393, were cancelled.  It is my understanding that when notices which clearly could not have been pursued because of technical or other issues were excluded, the use of discretionary powers at issue relates to approximately 2.5% of notices issued.  There are, of course, many other issues identified in the report about the enforcement of notices, including with regard to the service of summonses on those who do not pay the fixed notice penalty.  While there are clearly problems to be addressed and dealt with, with regard to the discretionary cancellation of fixed charge notices, this particular issue is only part of the problem.<\/p><p> I am sure it must be a source of some frustration to the Comptroller and Auditor General that the various deficiencies which he identified in past years were not addressed by previous Governments.  There have been other reports on the matter, including one furnished to my predecessor in the Department of Justice, then Minister Dermot Ahern, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on the fixed charge processing system, which he received in early 2009.  I do not know why that report was not published or why its recommendations were not implemented in full.  That GSOC report clearly addressed and anticipated some of the managerial and administrative difficulties of which we are now all aware.  As I believe there should be full transparency in matters of this nature, I have asked my Department to arrange, even at this late stage, for a copy of that report to be put on my Department's website.  I believe the report will be of some interest as, among the many issues it addresses, is the importance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having appropriate flexibility in exercising discretionary judgments with regard to whether to issue or terminate fixed notice charges.  It makes the point that it is important the Garda exercises such discretion in order to maintain good public relations, as receiving a fixed charge notice might be the only time an individual member of the public is required to engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> In dealing with what has become known as the penalty points controversy, I want to stress to the House that my only interest at all times has been the public interest.  That required that allegations made by whistleblowers be properly addressed and that any problems with the penalty points system be tackled so that public confidence in it could be maintained.  That is exactly what has happened and is happening.  I am firmly of the view that it is unacceptable for any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to use his or her discretion in regard to the cancellation of fixed charge notices or penalty points other than in a fair and impartial manner in accordance with the criteria which apply.  It is clearly a serious matter where departures have taken place in applying that standard and all required steps must be taken to ensure it does not happen in future.<\/p><p> These are all important issues which require a proper response.  I have already acknowledged today, and on previous occasions, the important role of the whistleblowers in highlighting problems and helping to bring about real change.  I hope that they can take some satisfaction from the considerable changes which have been and are being brought about.  Following receipt of the allegations made, what was important was that I made sure that their claims were properly addressed and this I have done.  Further new claims made by them, subsequent to the publication of the O'Mahoney report, with regard to the fixed charge processing system, resulted in my referring all of these matters to GSOC for its consideration and I want to be careful to say nothing today which could in any way prejudice the investigation being undertaken by GSOC.<\/p><p> The most serious allegations specifically made relating to the fixed charge processing system and penalty points related to what were described as: shocking criminality by several Garda officers; serious fraud and corruption within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; perversion of the course of justice by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; Garda inspectors and superintendents perverting the course of justice on a massive scale; at least seven road fatalities resulting from the termination of fixed charge notices; hundreds of official Garda PULSE records altered and destroyed; and an allegation that the Garda had no discretionary power whatsoever to cancel notices.<\/p><p> I would be failing in my duty as Minister for Justice and Equality, and in danger of misleading the House, if I did not point out that there has as yet been no finding to show that these allegations are correct.  It is generally accepted that garda&iacute; may, in clear and transparent circumstances, exercise discretion to terminate fixed charge notices, and the approach that should be taken is clearly detailed in the report of the Garda Inspectorate.  All of these issues will be revisited by GSOC.  It would be unfair for the individual members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involved, and against whom allegations have been made, to be presumed guilty of such serious charges.  In this context, having regard to the conclusions of the O'Mahoney report, and these matters again pending before GSOC, it is inappropriate that Members of this House and commentators outside it act on the assumption that all of the allegations made are accurate.  The presumption of innocence remains a central tenet of our justice and constitutional system.<\/p><p> I accept it was no part of the remit of the Garda Inspectorate to examine individual allegations of criminality or corruption with regard to the fixed charge processing system.  However it would also be unfair if l did not note that what the Garda Inspectorate identified was summed up by the chief inspector of the Garda Inspectorate, Bob Olson, when he said that what they saw was &quot;managerial and administrative dysfunction.&quot;  GSOC may take a different view from that of the O'Mahoney report and that expressed by Mr. Olson.<\/p><p> There are issues of real substance to be addressed in ensuring that we have a fixed charge processing system that operates fairly, efficiently and transparently.  That is what we all want to see and it is in the public interest.  I do not seek to minimise in any way the failings that have been identified regarding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but most people would recognise that penalty points are only a small, albeit important, aspect of the work it does.  Penalty points are of particular importance in road safety.  Mr. Olson, in an interview following the publication of the Garda Inspectorate's report on the fixed charge processing system, stated that this is a &quot;very minor piece of what the Garda&iacute; do.&quot;<\/p><p> A substantial proportion of Garda time is and must be spent in preventing and investigating crime and in providing the necessary evidence to facilitate the prosecution of individuals before the courts.  Garda&iacute; daily engage in the fight against subversion by the self-styled new IRA and other criminal terrorists and investigate serious crime including homicide, rape, sexual assault, robbery, burglary, fraud, money-laundering, kidnapping, aggravated assault, ordinary assault and a range of other offences, all with the objective of keeping our communities safe.  In the context of the controversy that has surrounded the subject matter of today's debate, we should not lose sight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enormous success in effecting a substantial reduction in crime across the State.  The recorded number of crime offences has decreased across a number of headings and the overall number of recorded criminal offences fell by almost 24,000 in 2012 as compared to 2006.  In the most recent 12-month period covered by the Central Statistics Office there was reduction of 7.1% in overall crime and 10.4% in burglary.  Regarding burglaries, Operation Fiacla, one of the Garda targeted operations, has been successful in that the most recent figures available up to 28 February 2014 detail that there have been 8,344 arrests and 4,755 charges brought pursuant to the operation.<\/p><p> The Garda national drugs unit, working with other national units, continues to target persons involved in the illicit supply and sale of drugs, with overall Garda drug seizures for the period 2011 to 2013 valued at over &euro;237 million.  Targeted operations by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners in the same period resulted in approximately 2.7 million litres of fuel being seized, 29 fuel laundries detected and shut down and 119 filling stations closed down by the Revenue Commissioners throughout the State for breaching licensing conditions.  In the same period 245.5 million cigarettes, with a retail value of &euro;108 million, and approximately 20,800 kg of tobacco, with a retail value of &euro;7.75 million, were seized.<\/p><p> The Garda continues to target and confront the various criminal gangs that exist in this State, with considerable success.  For example, concerted Garda action in recent years against criminal gangs in Limerick has resulted in more than 20 gang leaders serving sentences for offences including murder, attempted murder and drugs and firearms offences, with life sentences imposed for at least 12 gang-related murders.  It is estimated that more than 100 prisoners in our prison system are associated with Limerick gangs, and a number of important trials are pending.  This is relevant to today's debate because it is crucial that the reforms required by the Garda Inspectorate be implemented but also that we keep this issue in perspective and in proportion.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays a vital role in the fight against crime, and garda&iacute; perform these duties often at great risk to themselves.  In considering the administrative and managerial dysfunction of the fixed charge processing system as detailed in the inspectorate's report, and as also detailed in earlier reports, it is of relevance that we have regard to the primary objective of the system, which is to reduce road fatalities and accidents, to ensure compliance with our road traffic laws and to increase road safety.<\/p><p> The record of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on keeping the roads safe is particularly instructive.  In 2005 there were 396 road deaths, while in 2012 there were 162.  While every death on our roads is a death too many, by any objective assessment the engagement by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in bringing about greater compliance with road safety rules and in reducing road fatalities has been a substantial success.  This is further evidenced by the substantial reduction in the numbers of individuals found to be over the specified alcohol limit in the context of roadside checks undertaken in 2013 as compared with 2007.  The rate of detection at mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints, MATs, has gone from one in 94 in 2007 to one in 476 in the first ten months of 2013 for which figures are available.  Unfortunately, there was an increase in road deaths in 2013 to 190, while to date this year there is again a decrease in road fatalities.  Garda enforcement continued at a high level in both 2012 and 2013, and it seems from the information available that the increase in road deaths in 2013 substantially related to individuals riding motorbikes, pedestrians and the extensive use by drivers of mobile phones.  Driver distraction has become an international focal point with regard to road fatalities, and I welcome the examination of this issue conducted at last Thursday's seminar on driver distraction held by the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  I hope the insights gained at that conference will assist in identifying new appropriate action that can be taken by either or both the RSA and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to effect further reductions in road fatalities and serious injuries resulting from road accidents.<\/p><p> While there was a worrying increase in the number of road deaths last year, at 190 they were still substantially below the 396 fatalities that occurred in 2005.  Garda enforcement of road traffic laws is central to achieving the substantial reduction in road fatalities that has occurred since 2005, and of course the contribution of the Road Safety Authority is also of crucial importance.  It is only fair to acknowledge the role of all members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, both management and rank and file, in the progress made to date.  I hope that implementation of the recommendations made by the Garda Inspectorate will result in further progress.<\/p><p> Since my appointment as Minister I have believed it would be in the interests of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the public it serves that there be an independent review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was agreed under the Haddington Road agreement that such a review would take place, and the terms of reference of the review are as follows:<blockquote>To review and make recommendations on the use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the resources available to it, with the objective of achieving and maintaining the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in its operation and administration.<br \/><br \/> The review shall encompass all aspects of the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including: - the structure, organisation and staffing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;<br \/><br \/>- the deployment of members and civilian staff to relevant and appropriate roles;<br \/><br \/>- the remuneration and conditions of service of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including an evaluation of annualised hours\/shift pay arrangements;<br \/><br \/>- the appropriate structures and mechanism for the future resolution of matters relating to pay, industrial relations and attendance matters.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>There was a delay in the commencement of the review because of issues that had to be addressed with the Garda associations subsequent to the Haddington Road agreement.  The issues that arose were addressed in a number of meetings held under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and work on the industrial relations aspects of the review formally started on 28 February.  This is being undertaken by Mr. Raymond McGee, a former deputy chair of the Labour Court.  The other part of the review - dealing with efficiency, effectiveness, structure, organisation, staffing and deployment - will be carried out by the Garda Inspectorate.  Arrangements are being finalised, again under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, to facilitate the formal commencement of work by the inspectorate.<\/p><p> The Garda Inspectorate performed very valuable work in the review of the fixed charge processing system and is well placed to carry out a much wider review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is expected that the review will be completed before the D&aacute;il reconvenes in September and it will provide important insights to any further reform required of a statutory or non-statutory nature, as will the report of the Oireachtas joint committee relating to GSOC and the other inquiries being conducted into matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is, of course, important not to prejudge the outcome of the work being undertaken by the various bodies and individuals on matters relating to the management and running of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I referenced this morning the work to be undertaken on the establishment of a Garda authority.<\/p><p> I hope the House can agree that it is in the public interest to do what we can to move on from the present controversy relating to penalty points and get on with the work under way which will achieve a fair, transparent and effective system.  It is of crucial importance that we proceed to implement, in accordance with the action plan, the recommendations made by the Garda Inspectorate.  I look forward to the recommendations being implemented and coming to fruition.  It is my earnest hope - I know it is shared by my Government colleagues - that we will take all actions required to establish a system in which there will be absolute public confidence and in respect of which there can be no further controversy.  An additional step should be taken to ensure the numbers of fatalities on the roads reduce further, with the numbers of serious injuries.  Ultimately, we must ensure greater road safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600038#LL01400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395848400,"counter":627,"content":"<p>Deputy Niall Collins is sharing time with Deputies Dara Calleary and John McGuinness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600041#OO00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1395848400,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this very important debate on the report of the Garda Inspectorate.  As a question and answer session will follow, I will use the opportunity to offer some questions which I hope the Minister will deal with.  <\/p><p>  I thank the chief inspector of the Garda Inspectorate, Mr. Robert Olson, for his clear, unambiguous and very concise report.  Having read it, everybody agrees that it sets out across five chapters where we are and where we hope to get to on this issue.  What is most welcomed by the public is that arising from the report and implementation of its recommendations will be a transparent code of Garda discretion that will be equal for all.  This is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>  Earlier we had a discussion about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  With other members of the Opposition, I detailed the catalogue of the Minister's failings to date.  I will reiterate them.  <\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned community policing, but he spearheaded the closure of almost 140 Garda stations in communities across the country.  This has deprived many of the presence of community garda&iacute;.  We should also recall that the Minister was not too long in office when he attempted to prematurely shut down the Smithwick tribunal.  He may contest that claim, now that the tribunal has concluded, but he was outed in that regard.  We are discussing the penalty points issue, but we have also heard about the bugging of GSOC and the Minister's treatment of that body, whistleblowers and the confidential recipient.  He has not dealt in his statement with any matter relating to Mr. Oliver Connolly.  There has also been an issue regarding the Judiciary, while the Garda Commissioner has resigned.  Some interesting information came into the public domain during Leaders' Questions today in that regard.<\/p><p>  Why did the Minister leak the report into the public domain before placing it before the Houses of the Oireachtas?  That was contemptuous of the Houses and Members; we are second-best when issues come up for discussion in an appropriate forum.  Yesterday the leaders of the two main Opposition parties were called to a briefing by the Taoiseach, but the media had the story before then.  There is a trend of showing disrespect for the Opposition parties, which is not good enough.  There was a report in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i> on an interview with Mr. Robert Olson that he had never met the Minister for Justice and Equality, despite the fact that they shared a building.  This came from a one-to-one interview between the journalist and Mr. Olson.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600041#OO00300","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1395848400,"counter":629,"content":"<p>It must be true so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600041#OO00400","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1395848400,"counter":630,"content":"<p>It is bizarre and the Minister for Justice and Equality should shed some light on the issue.<\/p><p>  My party and I support the recommendations made in the Garda Inspectorate's report which seek to rectify a number of problems uncovered in the system that cost the State almost &euro;8 million per annum.  The report recommends that the summons service process be reviewed to establish why so many summons were not served and that a system be immediately introduced to ensure all penalty points are endorsed on driving licences.  It recommends that the cancellation authority for penalty points be centralised and that petitions for cancellation only be considered when accompanied by factual third party evidence, with all offenders being informed of the cancellation policy.  There is also a recommendation that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport address the legal difficulties in imposing penalty points on the drivers of company and hired cars, as well as unregistered vehicles.  The inspectorate recommends that consideration be given to enacting new legislation imposing heavy penalties on companies which refuse to name offending drivers and that in the case of off-duty garda&iacute;, a superior officer be notified of any detection, as it could affect the assignment of duties.  We fully support the recommendations made in the Garda Inspectorate's report.<\/p><p>  The Minister took the opportunity to make a long-awaited apology to the whistleblowers.  People will wonder why it took him six months to do this, after all the kicking and screaming.  What has changed that he has now decided to issue this apology?  It is hard to shake the suspicion that he knows the game is up.  The public has cast its judgment and the Minister has decided to make a last-ditch effort to save face and his own skin.  He has reinstated the good names of Sergeant Maurice McCabe and John Wilson, but it is too little, too late.<\/p><p>When he issued his apology he implied John O&rsquo;Mahoney should have done more and made better efforts.  In the Minister&rsquo;s classic form he apologises but subcontracts some of the blame to the author of the previous report on which he seeks to rely.  It has taken him six months to apologise.  That is not good enough.  The Taoiseach stood over the Minister when he discredited the good names of two citizens and allowed that cloud to hang over them for almost six months.  Shame on the Minister for doing that.<\/p><p> The Minister did not address the actions of Mr. Connolly, the former confidential recipient, and what he said in the transcript circulating in the public domain.  I asked the Minister this morning, and he has not taken the opportunity in making a statement here now, to address what Mr. Connolly said to Sergeant Maurice McCabe about how the Minister would act and what he would do.  That is very serious for an officeholder in the Minister&rsquo;s capacity.<\/p><p> The Minister did not address, or attribute any of the credit due to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, for describing the whistleblowers as &quot;distinguished&quot;, which helped bring about his statement today.  He was followed by other members of the Cabinet.  The Minister has not acknowledged the very valuable input of the Road Safety Authority.  That was a glaring omission in his statement.<\/p><p> I have asked the Minister several questions.  He said the position of Garda Commissioner has been filled temporarily and he intends to carry out an open competition to fill the vacancy permanently.  Everyone will welcome that.  Hopefully the person who fills that position will not carry the baggage of any previous scandal.  Will the interviews conducted by the recently departed Commissioner for the senior vacancies stand, or will an open interview process recommence for the vacancies for Deputy and Assistant Commissioners?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600041#OO00500","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395849000,"counter":632,"content":"<p>The Minister stated he hoped the insights gained at the road safety conference last week would assist in identifying new appropriate action.  I congratulate him - his luck is in.  Were it not for that conference, and the remarks of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, who called the Minister for what he is, we would not be here and would not have heard the apology to the Garda whistleblowers.  The Minister was dragged kicking and screaming into the Chamber this week.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport shamed him into making the speech he has just made.  His first wish for the impact of that conference has come true.  I hope his second wish for its impact on road safety will come equally true.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport deserves some credit.  Once again, however, the Minister for Justice and Equality could not resist passing the ball to the Assistant Commissioner, Mr. O&rsquo;Mahoney, saying it was his fault that he did not speak to the whistleblowers.  This morning it was the fault of the Attorney General for not drawing attention to the tapes.  It is always the fault of someone else, never of the Minister. <\/p><p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is in Farmleigh paying tribute to the Irish rugby team.  The Minister for Justice and Equality should be there because his ability to pass a ball would give him a place on the team.

One would imagine from listening to it that the Minister is the most enthusiastic reformer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who ever walked the earth and that he is the best Minister since Ministers were invented, according to the Taoiseach and all those who defend him.  He stated repeatedly, &ldquo;if I ignored the allegations&rdquo;.  He tried his level best to ignore the allegations.  Were it not for his own actions, which prompted a motion of no confidence in this House last year there would have been none of these reports.  That he had private information, given to him by the former Commissioner, which he used against Deputy Wallace, landed him in a situation where he had to give in to all those reports.  That is the only reason we are here again today and why the reports were commissioned.  His ability to have that tittle-tattle puts into doubt his remark that he had no knowledge of the very serious issues of which he pleads ignorance in his Department.  He was in control of basic information, or does he ask senior Garda officers about the police files of his political colleagues?  That is why we cannot trust him to manage his job.  That is why his wish to move on, as he always wishes, cannot be respected because while we move on with him in charge the kind of confidence he expects and hopes for in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not exist.<\/p><p>  I welcome the announcement of a review.  What will be the public input into the review?  Has the Minister envisaged what kind of public consultation system there will be?  Will the Garda Inspectorate seek views from people around the country?  Does the Minister intend to proceed with the appointment process for a new Commissioner immediately or await the outcome of the review?  As he has laid out the review he hopes for a changed force.  I hope with that blueprint in place he will proceed with the appointment of a Commissioner to manage that changed force.  I do not know whether he has had time to reflect on that process and what it will involve but I welcome the fact that it will be an open process. <\/p><p>  The issues raised this morning are central to this debate because the Minister&rsquo;s style is in question.  His and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s acknowledgement this morning that the Attorney General went to the Taoiseach first on Sunday with the allegations in her file is very serious.  It demonstrates a completely dysfunctional relationship between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Attorney General, the Minister responsible for security, who is also the Minister for Defence, and the chief law officer in the country.  It speaks volumes that the Attorney General had no confidence in the Minister&rsquo;s ability to manage information and went to the Taoiseach and, most bizarrely, refused to speak to him on the phone but wanted to speak to him face to face and that the Taoiseach did not bring the Minister into that loop for 24 hours.  It shows that the Minister is not fit to serve.  He does not have the confidence of the Attorney General.  He may have the confidence of the Taoiseach but the confidence of many of his colleagues as expressed in recent days is weak, to say the best of it.<\/p><p>  If we are to move on from here the Garda review process needs to consider the kind of personnel and training involved in senior management of the Garda.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has drawn attention to the Garda record in recent years, to its successes in policing and protecting communities here and abroad but those on the street and on the beat have been let down by management who cannot see the importance of their role, or understand the importance of public confidence in their role.  That management style needs to change.  While the Government continues to cling to the Minister the change unfortunately rests on his shoulders.  That is why the review must involve the public and international expertise on how a modern policing force can continue to drive forward in our community with the kind of threats we face.  Will the Minister deal with the question of international involvement?<\/p><p>  We are at a very serious impasse in the history of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>What we saw yesterday was an attempt to politicise the force by sacking the Commissioner.  He did not retire.  The Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality does not call on a Monday evening to offer a retirement card.  The fact that the information was revealed through RTE because the Taoiseach did not announce it in the House makes me wonder what else happened on Monday that we have yet to be informed about.  The review that the Minister announced is incredibly important.  These reports are incredibly important.  The Guerin report and other reports will lead to change in the management structure and the rebuilding of respect and morale in the force.  Meanwhile, however, the confidential recipient and the Commissioner have gone, and God knows who else will go before the report is published in September.  I suspect it is the Minister's intention to remain in office.  I regret to say that while he is still there, there can be no change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600042#PP00400","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395849600,"counter":636,"content":"<p>The Minister concluded his statement by expressing the hope that we can move on from the present controversy over penalty points.

The Minister would not be here today but for the fact that he set out to protect the culture that led us to this position.  One need only to look at his attitude towards Maurice McCabe and John Wilson.  I wish John Wilson a speedy recovery, which is something the Minister did not do.  I do not doubt this affair has had an impact on his health.  Did the Minister ever meet or speak to Maurice McCabe and John Wilson?  Does he intend to call them in to ask them about this debacle and ascertain what information they gave to the Road Safety Authority, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts?  Does he know what documentation was in circulation?  Has he seen the documentation and does he understand why two serving policeman, Maurice McCabe and the now retired John Wilson, were so annoyed and upset about the system that they put their careers at stake to become known as whistleblowers?<\/p><p>  What the Minister said about the goodness of the Garda and the work it does is true and beyond doubt.  None of us questions that.  However, we are questioning the culture that condemned those two men the moment they opened their mouths to say that something was wrong.  I like to consider them as concerned citizens who are employed as garda&iacute;.  A range of meanings can be drawn from the word &quot;whistleblower&quot;.  These are concerned citizens who came forward with statements that they could back up with facts and evidence.  When they tried to make the institution understand that something was wrong, the desire to protect the culture kicked in.  The Minister was part of that culture of protection.  He did not listen.  Much could have been done but he did not do it.  I raised these issues in another debate while the Minister was also sitting opposite.  The only issue he raised with me by letter subsequent to that debate was why the lady whistleblower in question did not use the processes available to her.  He wrote to me, but perhaps it is the fault of somebody else in the Department who stamped a letter about which the Minister knows nothing.  That was the only issue he raised with me.  Why should this individual use the processes?  She went to the confidential recipient but he told her the last person who had used the system was washing cars in Navan.  After I made my statement in the D&aacute;il, did the Minister check it out?  I doubt it.  This person was reporting that something was wrong with the system.  She was declaring it could not be trusted.  We heard nothing about it from the confidential recipient, who has since been relieved of his duties.  Surely that man has a body of evidence that he could give to the Minister or the acting commissioner, but no attempt has been made on the part of the Minister or his Department to get the information.  That lady's case remains to be dealt with.  She was bullied and pushed out of the force, like John Wilson but not like Sergeant McCabe.  What impressed us most about Sergeant McCabe's contribution to the Committee of Public Accounts was that despite legal advice not to do so, he turned up in full uniform and he sat on his own across from members to tell us his side of the story without mentioning a single name.  He told us that he was proud to appear before the committee and to be a member of the force.  His fundamental message was that the force needed to be sorted out but during the course of the O'Mahoney investigation nobody went to him.  In any factory or business, if an employee spoke badly about his or her organisation, the foreman or boss would ask to have a chat.  That did not happen.<\/p><p>  The Minister has apologised to John Wilson and Maurice McCabe.  What about the lady whistleblower to whom he has not apologised?  What about the way he treated them prior to his remarks?  Essentially he told them to put up and shut up.  That was an awful way to deal with two men who had nothing in their minds but the betterment of the force.  Will he apologise to the lady whistleblower who was forced out of the Garda because she made a complaint of sexual harassment?  Is that something he should investigate?  I believe it is.  Will he apologise to Lucia O'Farrell, whose son was killed on the roadside?  A number of legally minded people have told her that the Minister should do something about that case.  I raised it with him on the same day I made my aforementioned comments but he never wrote to me about it.  Did he look over the file and will he do anything with it?  The O'Farrell case highlights all that is wrong with investigations, the Attorney General's office and the system of justice in this country.  I appeal to the Minister to include that case for consideration.  As the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, was whispering sweet nothings into the ear of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, I hope they heard clearly what I have said on that case.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister, Deputy Shatter, apologise to the members of the Traveller community whose records are now on the PULSE system?

Can the Minister imagine they probably met while they were on duty, or in whatever circumstances, and got talking about some of the issues that they had come across?  They, maybe, found strength in each other to raise them and then took their concerns to the former Garda confidential recipient, Mr. Oliver Connolly.<\/p><p>  After months and months of getting nowhere - I will deal with the sacking of Mr. Connolly later on and some of the detail of the conversations that he had with the Garda whistleblowers, and I note that Deputy McGuinness has revealed some more details today about other conversations and a culture that existed - instead of being supported they were being advised that they would be better to stay schtum because they would not want to get in the way of the Minister and the Garda Commissioner and their close relationship.  That is what is in the transcript.  Rather than the Garda confidential recipient feeling empowered that he, as a mediator, would have the ability to bring these issues to the Minister for Justice and Equality and they would be pursued without fear or favour, he found himself advising them otherwise.  It is disturbing to read through that transcript.  That was the stonewalling that took place for those months.<\/p><p>  After that, obviously, they got together and said that the seriousness of that which they were unravelling and on which they were building evidence was something that they could not merely let stay within this stonewall internal shut-down system.  They then took their concerns to the Comptroller and Auditor General and sent detailed evidence of their allegations.  They also sent them to the Road Safety Authority, and to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There was much concern, and many conversations taking place between those bodies, and it was established and agreed that this was serious material that needed to taken seriously and addressed properly.<\/p><p>  Still not really seeing progress, they then availed of their right under the law, under section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, to take their issue to a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, in this case, Deputy Clare Daly.  Deputy Clare Daly and other colleagues then did their job and came into this House and raised the urgency of this matter.  Then, in and around that time, finally, rather than an independent examination immediately of all of these serious matters with a considerable bulk of evidence to back them up in terms of documentation, the choice was to go for an in-house investigation.  That in-house investigation, carried out by the assistant commissioner, Mr. O'Mahoney, never availed of the opportunity to speak to the whistleblowers who made the allegations.  The Minister should think about the following.  Imagine I ring my local Garda station to state my house has been robbed and I am really worried.  I ask if somebody can be sent out and the garda comes out onto my street and knocks on every door on my street except my house, the house that was robbed and reported the alleged crime.  That is what happened here and the Minister stood over that.<\/p><p>  The report was issued in 2013 and the Minister went out on the plinth and castigated with glee the two Garda whistleblowers stating that the vast bulk of what they had stated was reckless, disproved and all over the place.  He held that line vigorously under challenge after challenge in this Chamber from the Opposition.  That is what he did.<\/p><p>  However, it all fell to pieces when the Comptroller and Auditor General made his report.  The key findings of that report included one in five persons who were facing road traffic offences were getting off; a half of all road-traffic related summons were not being issued; and, in some Garda districts the level of termination of penalty points was 50 times higher than others.  It was a damning report.  After that, I came in here, along with other members of the Opposition, and stated that the two Garda whistleblowers had been vindicated and asked the Minister if he would find it within himself to acknowledge that and carry out an independent inquiry into these matters as soon as possible.  There was no doubt about it then.  It was big, it needed to be looked at.  There was massive dysfunction in the management of the system which should ensure we do not have one rule for one motorist and another rule for another, and we needed to change all of that.  The Minister refused to address it point blank.  It then dragged on.<\/p><p>  The Committee of Public Accounts did its job and brought forward the relevant officials until, eventually, the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, came before them.  He talked about &quot;so-called whistleblowers&quot;, and then, of course, he went on to use that now notorious phrase, &quot;disgusting&quot;.  The Minister knows the message that sent out to any person, man or woman, working in the public or private sectors, that if one speaks out, puts ones career on the line and isolates one's family in one's workplace, that is the level of support one can expect.  The Minister never spoke out about those comments.  Of course, he himself had misled the House by stating that the whistleblowers failed to co-operate - talk about turning words around to suit whatever agenda was there.<\/p><p>  That was the period of two years on the path those two whistleblowers walked.  I had a chance to speak to them, as had many other members of the Opposition, on numerous occasions.<\/p><p>They and their families were very isolated and briefly wondered, at times, if they had done the right thing.  It is a difficult and lonely place to be.  There was very little support but, over time, more journalists, Opposition Members and some Government Members became interested.  Finally, when it came to crisis point with what the Garda Commissioner said before the Committee of Public Accounts and the major outcry, the Minister decided to refer it to GSOC for a vigorous, independent examination of the matters at hand.  That is the journey, that is what happened.<\/p><p> Now we move on to the apology.  It is good that both men are entirely vindicated.  They and their families can have some sense of solace that the Minister has finally done this.  However, none of the public and no one watching these proceedings believes the Minister has come to this of his own volition.  This is to save the Minister's hide.  It is too little, too late and this is about saving his political hide.  It was impossible not to come in and issue the apology; otherwise, the Minister was gone.  Even though the Minister has finally done the right thing and given an apology to the men, he should go.  He should resign from his position because of other issues.<\/p><p> Let us walk through the allegations that GSOC offices were bugged.  On Monday, the day after the report in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>, the Department or perhaps the Minister advised the Taoiseach with a line misquoting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  He turned the victim into the villain.  Can we imagine anywhere in Europe where there is a real and legitimate suspicion that an independent ombudsman's office had been the victim of a surveillance attack and that the focus immediately goes to whether it adhered to legislation and reported it to the Minister?  That would be bad enough if the Minister was right but he misquoted the legislation.  The Minister landed the Taoiseach in that mess that day.  The Minister summoned the GSOC chairman, Simon O'Brien, to his building.  The next day the Minister came into the House and delivered a report that there was nothing to see here, that everything was hunky-dory and that it was all madness.  That was the plan.  We know the Minister was given a written briefing by GSOC on Monday that specified three key threats identified by Verrimus, the security company based in Britain.  In respect of the second threat, the report stated that the chances of the test result on the phone in the chairman's office at 1 a.m being a coincidence rather than a threat were next to zero.  That is very strong language yet the Minister left it out of his presentation to the D&aacute;il.  The second threat concerned the IMSI catcher, also known as the stingray, a device that captures 3G and other networks.  The threat was described by Verrimus as Government-level technology and the Minister chose to leave out that description.  I can only reach the conclusion that the Minister did so to give the impression there was nothing to see so that he could protect the Commissioner and refuse to accept what was presented to him.<\/p><p> One would think the Minister would step back after doing so but the following Tuesday he came into the House with a peer review from an Irish security company, Rits.  He gleefully talked about the fact that there was nothing to see here unless the customers of the Insomnia coffee shop were spying on GSOC.  This was a condescending remark.  The Minister said that not only was there no definitive evidence but no evidence whatsoever and nothing to see here.  This was a strong rebuttal.  That report was remarkably similar to that of the journalist Paul Williams in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>that morning.  When I heard the Minister's speech, I thought it was a strong statement.  The Minister came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions and was asked to give a summary of the findings of the Rits report that led the Minister to make such a strong statement.  After three weeks, now that he has finally done so, it is contemptuous.  The Minister may come back with something stronger but the onus is on him to do so.  What is in the public domain does not justify the Minister's testimony.  The objective was to dismantle those who had profound concerns and circle the wagons around the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p> The next issue concerns the sacking of the confidential recipient, Oliver Connolly.  The behaviour of the Minister has been remarkable in his refusal to entertain any criticism of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na senior management.  By doing so, he has utterly failed the vast majority of the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and led the organisation into disrepute.  He has led them into crisis after crisis and the man or woman on the frontline now has a more difficult job to do.  That is why the Minister must go.  The culture in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na senior management was a closed culture and involved shutting down the ability of the outside world to criticise its management and mechanisms.  That is all now in shreds.<\/p><p> That leads to my final comments.  The Minister is now an adherent of an independent police authority.  Is it not wonderful to see the Pauline conversion on the road to Damascus?  I raised this matter in a priority question to the Minister.  I asked him if he would go for an independent policing authority and the Minister robustly rejected it, talking about all the reasons why not.  The Minister has come around but everything he has come round to has involved kicking and screaming.  Let us go back over what the Minister has come round to.  He has come around to an independent policing authority, more powers and a properly resourced and strengthened GSOC.  Although Sinn F&eacute;in is not happy with it, believing it should be an independent commission of investigation, the Minister has come around to the idea of an independent review of the allegations that GSOC offices could be bugged.  The Minister resisted but came around to it under pressure.  The Minister resisted the documentation handed over by the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, Deputy Martin, to the Taoiseach.  It is now subject to an independent review.  We are not happy with that and believe it should be a commission of investigation but it is an independent review, which the Minister resisted.  Now, the Minister resisted an apology but here he is to save his hide.<\/p><p> It is too little, too late.  It is great that it happened but it should have come from the Taoiseach and he should have sacked the Minister and delivered this apology.  The Labour Party will seek political cover tonight but in every town, village, street and townland, regardless of people's political affiliation, they think the Minister should go.  We must then set about the vital work of restoring public confidence in the administration of justice and to put in place a modern policing organisation that is fully accountable and transparent for the century we live in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600044#RR02700","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395850800,"counter":672,"content":"<p>We all know that when Sergeant Maurice McCabe and the now retired garda, John Wilson, came forward within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with serious concerns about the administration of the penalty points system, they were systematically and deliberately frustrated in their efforts.  On paper, there was a system within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the confidential recipient for serving members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to bring forward their concerns and to have them addressed.<\/p><p>Not alone did that system fail but it actively connived to prevent the two whistleblowers making known their concerns and having the concerns investigated and remedied.  That is how serious the blockage was within the Garda.  It was not sloppiness, happenstance or accidental; it was a deliberate decision within the Garda to try to shut up the two men.  Not alone that; another decision was taken within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply pressure on those individuals and to obstruct them in carrying out what should have been very routine tasks in the course of their duties.  That is what happened.<\/p><p> God knows the penalty points issue has been debated and discussed for months on end.  Even today, I am still left with the very strong impression that the Minister does not understand how fundamentally toxic those events were within the Garda.  I am convinced that the Minister&rsquo;s strategy of minimising the issue and trying to gloss over it is not just a public position on his part; that is how he analyses, interprets and understands what happened.  Somewhere in the corner of the Minister&rsquo;s mind this was not such a big deal.  It was revealing today when the Minister again referred to the penalty points system and said it was a minor aspect of their work to support his own case.<\/p><p> Maurice McCabe and John Wilson not only deserve an apology they deserve a commendation from the Minister and the Government for their courage and absolute persistence and stamina.  Not alone do they deserve to be acknowledged; their families deserve to be acknowledged too.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, to which my colleague referred, comprehensively vindicated the two men, as did the report of the Garda inspectorate.  The Garda inspectorate went further than the Comptroller and Auditor General could go or was prepared to go in that it estimated the loss of revenue to the State by the failure to serve summonses at approximately &euro;7.4 million.  We never got a concrete figure from the Comptroller and Auditor General but the broad calculation was always somewhere in and around &euro;5 million.  The moneys that were lost, although not game changers in terms of the overall budgetary arithmetic, were nonetheless sizeable sums of money.<\/p><p> On top of what happened to the two garda&iacute; within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Minister compounded the wrongs visited on them.  He abused the men in the most crude and public manner possible.  He questioned their truthfulness and their personal and professional credibility.  The Minister came into the House and made a statement that was factually incorrect and calculated to further undermine the two men.  In doing that, he was wrong.  Today, under more pressure than grace, the Minister finally conceded that he was wrong.  I take issue with the Minister on his apology.  Remarkably, as he apologised the Minister claimed it was never his intention to mislead the House.  I challenge him on that because it was very much the Minister's intention to mislead this House.  It was clearly his intention to paint the two men as irresponsible-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600045#SS00200","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395851400,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy that it is not in order to accuse a member of the Government of deliberately misleading the House.

The Minister claimed that it was not his intention to mislead the House and I challenge that assertion because this House was misled.  In a calculated and repeated fashion this House was told that the garda&iacute;, in particular Sergeant Maurice McCabe, failed to co-operate with established Garda procedures.  We were certainly misled had we been foolish enough to take the Minister on his word.  The Minister knew at that time, as he conceded today, that no attempt had been made throughout the O&rsquo;Mahony process to speak to those garda&iacute;.  The Minister knew that then, even as he made the statement.<\/p><p>  One could ask what has changed between then and now.  The Minister said in the course of his apology that he had revisited the information.  What new information has crossed the desk of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to demonstrate to him the error of his ways?  I do not think there was any new information.  The facts are the facts.  The difference today is that the Minister knows it is no longer politically acceptable for him to continue the attack on those two men.  He knows public opinion is entirely against him and entirely supportive of the two brave whistleblowers.<\/p><p>  The Minister told us also that his brave new dawn for policing will be all about accountability.  That is welcome.  What about the Minister&rsquo;s accountability?  Is it really sufficient for the Minister months later, having abused the men on the plinth outside the D&aacute;il, and having abused his position to place false information on the record of the D&aacute;il and then to persist in the falsehood, to simply come to the House and make a fairly lukewarm apology to the men?  The question is whether that is enough.  To my mind it is not.  I do not think the Minister has any appetite for accountability himself.  While he might preach it to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na he is certainly not amenable to taking the consequences of his own actions or inaction.  If the Minister really believed in accountability he would step down from his position in Cabinet.  The reason he would do that is that it would be as clear to him as it is to everybody else in the country that he has no credibility when it comes to reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He has no credibility when it comes to protecting whistleblowers.  Neither does he have credibility when he lauds GSOC and talks about the need to reform that body.  The Minister has absolutely no credibility when he claims that it was Tuesday morning before he saw crucial correspondence on the illegal recording of telephone calls to and from Garda stations.  The Minister has no credibility whatsoever in respect of his portfolio.<\/p><p>  In the course of the litany of chaos that has surrounded the Minister in recent months, people have fallen like skittles.  The Minister&rsquo;s friend, the confidential recipient, is gone.  The Garda Commissioner is gone.  The Minister's friend, the Taoiseach, continues to defend him trenchantly and in a manner that amazes public opinion.<\/p><p>The Minister's response to all of this in the midst of all this mess, over which he presides, is: \"I hope the House can agree that it would be in the public interest to do what we can to move on from the present controversy ... and get on with the work which is under way which will achieve a fair, transparent and effective system.\"  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has made his apology in the hope that we will all move on and forget all about it but that is not a position that is acceptable to Sinn F&eacute;in.  If the Deputy is going to be the Minister who talks about accountability he should start with himself.  The accountable and responsible thing for the Minster, Deputy Shatter, to do is to step down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600046#TT00500","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395852000,"counter":679,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Wallace who is sharing time with Deputies Daly, Higgins and Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600047#UU00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1395852000,"counter":680,"content":"<p>During the past 18 months the Minister's handling of the different crises that have arisen has been generally weak, ineffective and indecisive and too often it has been governed by his appetite for political survival rather than an appetite for doing the right thing according to the responsibilities of his Ministry.<\/p><p>  I do not have enough time to  go through everything but I will outline 30 bullet points as to why the Minister should resign: <\/p><p>No. 1 - he bypassed GSOC and ignored its statutory remit and role to investigate Garda misconduct in regard to the Roma children controversy; <\/p><p>No. 2 - in the terms of reference he set out for the Ombudsman for Children he did not allow for any examination of the racial ethnic profiling which was central to the whole issue; <\/p><p>No. 3 - he was satisfied with the Commissioner's assurances that no racial profiling takes place despite the ECRI report, UN committee report and the whistleblowers' PULSE allegations regarding 40 Traveller families; <\/p><p> No. 4: instead of dealing with the penalty points issue properly and thoroughly from the outset by setting up an independent inquiry or even referring it to GSOC, he first ordered a constitutionally flawed internal investigation that violated the rule against bias because the garda&iacute; were allowed to investigate themselves and the rule of hearing the other side because the whistleblowers were not interviewed;<\/p><p>No. 5 - despite what the Minister said today, page 8 of the inspector's report states that they did not get the report until 4 July after some political pressure;<\/p><p>No. 6 - the Minister suddenly decided to refer the penalty points matter to GSOC in January of this year but again only under political pressure rather than in the considered exercise of his ministerial duties to properly address the matter;<\/p><p>No. 7 - he only allowed for GSOC access to PULSE this year, despite GSOC demanding it in September.

He emphasised the lack of management structures, training - the same sort of criticisms as in the Morris report - and the pattern of failings within senior Garda management, and the Minister has presided over this;<\/p><p>No. 26 - Professor Walsh also emphasised the lack of transparency - the Garda Inspectorate found that the policy regarding fixed charge notice cancellations was purposely not made public;<\/p><p>No. 27 - in this House the Minister has denigrated citizens exercising their legal right to protest at Corrib Gas as &quot;tourist protestors&quot; intent on &quot;sabotaging jobs&quot; and followed the last Fianna F&aacute;il justice Minister in refusing to permit GSOC to initiate a section 106 investigation into policing issues at Corrib when we asked him to do so;<\/p><p>No. 28 - on 26 February in reply to Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, who asked about the Commissioner's &quot;disgusting&quot; remark, the Minister said &quot;I have not read the transcript and do not know the context in which the Commissioner made his comment&quot;.  Does the Minister think the people are stupid?;<\/p><p>No. 29 - Judge Smithwick's description of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as valuing loyalty over honesty and truth sadly applied to the relationship that the Minister had with the Commissioner and, sadly, it looks like it also relates to the relationship that the Taoiseach has with the Minister; and,<\/p><p>No. 30 - as Gene Kerrigan said last Sunday, a fish rots from the head and the rot starts with the Minister.  <\/p><p>  The Minister has apologised to the whistleblowers today and has committed to an independent police board but when we introduced the police Bill last July he said that it would be undemocratic to oversee the police with an independent police board.  The Taoiseach told us today that the Minister was the first to recommend strengthening GSOC but when we recommended that in our Bill he rubbished it.  <\/p><p>  With respect to the serious allegations regarding criminality and serious corruption which the Minister thinks have been dismissed, he should remember that they have only been examined by assistant commissioner O'Mahoney in a report now discredited whereas the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Garda Inspectorate's report were only asked to look into the system, not these allegations.<\/p><p>  I have emphasised that the Minister seems to have played down the penalty points system as being only a small part of what the garda&iacute; do but it is symptomatic of everything else they do.  We have heard many sad stories from the public about their poor experience at the hands of some garda&iacute; and they are nothing short of frightening.  We have got information from ex-garda&iacute; and serving garda&iacute; and it made for difficult listening. <\/p><p>  A guy I do not know from Adam sent me a note the day after I addressed the Minister here on 26 February.  He told me that I spoke for the people who are shy and cannot express themselves.  He also told me that I spoke for the people who cannot speak out.  He told me that I spoke for the people who keep their heads down and fear authority.   <\/p><p>He told me I spoke for the people who are hurt and sad and that I spoke for him.<\/p><p> Does it bother the Minister that he is the head of justice in Ireland while so many people feel they do not get justice and that the Minister does not represent them?  I am sorry to say that while I find the Minister a very able man and very intelligent, it looks as though he is not fit for office, and he should not be here any more.  I will be dead honest and say I will actually miss him when he is gone - I really will, and I am genuine about this - but he should be gone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600047#UU00500","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395852600,"counter":684,"content":"<p>The Minister cuts a lonely figure, surrounded by just one simple Government backbencher and not a Labour Party colleague in sight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600048#VV00125","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1395852600,"counter":685,"content":"<p>Do not worry; I am not simple at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600048#VV00150","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1395852600,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Perhaps they have scurried off to try to find their conscience and public service in this area.  The Minister started his latest explanation of his conduct today by supposedly clarifying the remarks he made about the whistleblowers in October last year when he accused them of not co-operating with the O'Mahoney tribunal.  In his own way he put forward what has been described as an apology, but really it is a bit half-baked.  His comments in October were not isolated; they were his consistent battle cry during the debate on these issues.<\/p><p>  In May, when Deputy Collins welcomed the O'Mahoney report, he accused us of rejecting all of the conclusions contained in it when he stated that it was clear to any fair-minded observer that some of the most serious allegations made had no basis in reality.  He was wrong and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate stated he was wrong.  This month he told us he could take his explanation of the situation with Maurice McCabe and the O'Mahoney inquiry no further and that there was no basis to the allegation that he had misled the House.  Today, again, he spent a considerable part of his contribution trying to cast doubt on a number of the allegations put forward by those Garda whistleblowers.  The Minister made a list and stated there had been no finding to show these allegations were correct.  I put it to the Minister that he is wrong.  Denying the taxpayer revenue from fines that could have been collected is fraud and is perverting the course of justice.  There have been no findings to state that these allegations are not correct.<\/p><p>  The Minister sought to rely in his contribution on remarks made by Bob Olson.  The Minister stated that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate had described the process as a managerial and administrative dysfunction.  In actual fact, Professor Dermot Walsh made the point that there is a very thin line between mismanagement and corruption.  As Deputy Wallace stated, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, like the Comptroller and Auditor General, had a very narrow remit.  It was not tasked with investigating corruption, and the quashing of penalty points is on the scale of corruption.<\/p><p>  The reason these issues are under public scrutiny is not the fairy tale we listened to from the Taoiseach earlier that the Minister is the great Garda reformer.  We know this is a lie from his contributions last year.  The only reason this is on the agenda is the heroic efforts of the whistleblowers and their dogged determination, against the odds, in not letting the issue go.  At every turn their efforts were met with belligerence and they were demonised, denied, vilified and ostracised by members of the force.  It is their courage and strength that has resulted in the spotlight being put on this issue, to the very great benefit of all decent garda&iacute; and all citizens of the State.<\/p><p>  How the whistleblowers were dealt with is important because it will set the tone for others in the force and outside it for the future.  I classify the Minister's remarks as mealy-mouthed and a grudging recognition of their role, which does not in any way ring true with me.  These men exposed the fact that the solutions to the problems identified in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the Morris tribunal and the measures that the State put in place were not working, and that the mechanisms that we stated would lead to a breaking down of the blue wall of silence did not work.  It is very important that their stance is protected.<\/p><p>  The former confidential recipient, Oliver Connolly, put out a statement that the transcript that was discussed in the House was unlawfully recorded by Maurice McCabe.  This is not true, and we need to put this on the record in the context that such recordings are often the only security and believable evidence whistleblowers have, and this source must be protected.  Intra-party recordings are entirely different to third-party recordings, and this point must be made.  Everything the whistleblowers did and every single step they took was lawful, but at every turn they were blocked.<\/p><p>  When the penalty points issue was announced and became public, what was the first response of the former Garda Commissioner?  Was it to speak to the lads, hear their concerns and see what was wrong?  No, it was not.  It was to put out a press statement that there was no question of a culture of termination of penalty points.  The very next day the Commissioner ordered a notice to go up on the notice board in all Garda stations, to protect the reputation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that no members of the Garda were to talk to external sources on pain of prosecution.  He then called in the whistleblowers and threatened to take them off PULSE.  John Wilson's car was searched and other circulars went up.  These people were ostracised in the Garda stations where they worked.  For these reasons, and not just the &quot;disgusting&quot; remark which verbalised his attitude, it was entirely appropriate for Commissioner Callinan to go.<\/p><p>  To me, Commissioner Callinan epitomised the idea that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could be above the law and was not open to challenge, and that its interests were separate from the interests of the public.  This system was highlighted by Mr. Justice Smithwick, who spoke about those who put loyalty to the force above honesty.  Every day when I drive down Pearse Street I see a row of cars parked on double yellow lines with not a ticket on them because everybody knows they belong to garda&iacute;.  Civil servants pay for parking across the road in the car park, but others believe that if one is a garda a perk of the job is that the law does not apply to one, and this is exactly what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report identified.<\/p><p>  The excuses stated by the assistant commissioner, Mr. O'Mahoney, included that these were garda&iacute; on duty and they had an entitlement to write off penalty points.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report focused on the fact they did not, and that just because one is a garda it does not mean one can use being late for work as an excuse for speeding, as a former commissioner appears to have done.  One must agree with the rules of the road and the procedures in place.<\/p><p>  A number of aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate's report are interesting.  This includes how accurately Garda Maurice McCabe understood the situation.  His analysis was perfect.  What is also interesting about the report is that the analysis we put forward and sent to the Minister and the RSA was pretty much spot on with regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report.  This analysis was compiled by a young solicitor, Leah O'Leary.  How come a young solicitor and a Garda sergeant were able to expose what five superintendents, six chief superintendents and 28 staff could not do in the O'Mahoney report?  It was because they did not have a vested interest.  They were interested in the truth, and this was the difference.<\/p><p>  Ordinary citizens in the State want a police force that is accountable.  We have the Cooke inquiry, the Guerin inquiry and now a commission of inquiry into these latest allegations.  The fact that there are illegal recordings which could have resulted in illegal prosecutions has huge ramifications for the State.  The fact that one of these tapes will reveal that somebody was fitted up for a serious crime is very worrying, but it is not surprising.  We have met people the length and breadth of the State whose lives have been ruined by the fact that their cases were not dealt with appropriately by the Garda.  The actions of the Garda in Ian Bailey's case were described by five Supreme Court judges as breathtaking wrongful misbehaviour.  These garda&iacute; were sent to France to give information about his case.  Baiba Saulite was a young woman who was shot dead and whose two children were left without their mother.  Garda&iacute; have brought information to the Minister stating that the abduction of her children was not properly investigated and this led to this woman losing her life and to her solicitor's life being endangered.<\/p><p>There have been cases of racial profiling of the Traveller community, an issue Deputy Mick Wallace and I raised with the Minister last year.  The Minister is on the record as stating, \"Both Deputies are a disgrace.\"  We were a disgrace for putting on the record of this House the fact that racial profiling occurred.  I spent the Sunday before last in Rathkeale, where a ten year old boy told me about how his house had been broken into and his family had been held at gunpoint in an armed robbery.  This was a robbery the police never investigated because they were Travellers.  He told me afterwards about how garda&iacute; and the Criminal Assets Bureau had broken into his house and how he had got down on his knees and begged the garda&iacute; not to shoot his granny and his mammy, yet it is claimed racial profiling does not occur in the State.  This is what I am talking about.  There are systemic problems in the operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> The last point I will make to the Minister is that the attitude of the Government is like the one I encountered when homeowners began to realise their houses were cracking because of pyrite.  Cracks had emerged, but people were in denial.  Those who raised and tried to state the issue must be dealt with were told not to talk about it because they would devalue the estate.  Instead, it was suggested the cracks be covered up and that things would be okay.  However, the truth will always come out and in that case, the only way to solve the problem was to remove the contaminated infill and rebuild the house.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the administration of justice cannot be restored with the Minister at the helm.  I, too, will miss him, but his days are numbered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600048#VV00200","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395853200,"counter":688,"content":"<p>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has finally apologised to the two Garda whistleblowers.  To do so, apparently, it was necessary for him to be flanked by a praetorian guard of political heavyweights, with the Taoiseach on one side and the Minister for Finance on the other.  They must have feared that, even as his very head depended on the apology, the Minister would be unable to bring himself to utter the hardest word in his extensive vocabulary, namely, \"sorry\".<\/p><p>  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties yesterday issued a statement entitled, &quot;Garda accountability; the rot must stop&quot;.  It referred to the litany of scandals and crises affecting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the political supervision of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Government.  It complained correctly about the boxing off of each of these matters in different investigations with no real powers for those investigating.  It demanded the creation of an inquiry to examine and report on the full spectrum of Garda accountability issues.  That is precisely what is needed.  However, a full and extensive examination cannot be carried out satisfactorily under the Commissions of Investigation Act, as it stands.  For a start, the Act directs that any inquiry be largely held in private, but any inquiry into these matters should be held in public.  The Government, apparently, intends to appoint senior or retired judges who themselves are pillars of the established order.  Any inquiry into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have the testimony and experience of ordinary people, working-class people in particular, who should be able to bring their experience at the hands of Garda malpractice, whether by individuals or as a body, into full play.  It should be a comprehensive, radical, root and branch investigation into how the Garda has operated for many years.  However, this cannot happen unless those at the sharp edge of Garda activity in a wrong fashion are involved fully, including victims of malpractice, minorities and other groups.  It should involve ordinary people who must wait for hours for garda&iacute; to arrive at their door when they need them in an emergency after making an urgent call because of the austerity cutbacks made by the Government.<\/p><p>  The most recent issue of the wholesale taping of the public, including legal advisers and clients, at many Garda stations has been overshadowed by the sheer incompetence pointed to by the fact that, allegedly, the Minister for Justice and Equality was not apprised that this was a serious issue until eight months after the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission had flagged it and four months after the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney General had set up a working group.  Why was there such delay?  Is it because the Garda Commissioner or the Government or both condoned this practice, that is, the illegal use of private conversations?  <\/p><p>  In another issue that beggars belief, the Data Protection Commissioner carried out a three year audit of the treatment of Garda data between 2011 and 2013, which led to the publication of a 95 page report this month.  While it details all manner and means of data, data collection and data retention, it does not contain a single word about the taping of telephone calls.  The Data Protection Commissioner must explain what happened in this regard, the reason this matter was not brought into the open or whether he was misled.<\/p><p>  I will refer briefly to other issues that require attention.  On children of members of the Traveller community being accorded criminal intelligence numbers on the PULSE system, thereby marking them out for life, I wish to hear about this issue.  I also refer to the closeness of the top echelons of the Irish news and media to the top echelons of the Garda, to penalty points being wiped out for the former and the crooked coverage they give this entire issue which favours the management of the Garda.  <\/p><p>  Where does the Labour Party stand tonight?  It has been utterly humiliated in this debacle.  I refer to the spectacle two weeks ago in this Chamber of the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, flapping incoherently while trying to defend the indefensible but without a word in demanding the apology the Minister has given tonight.  Instead, it covered over the fact that such an apology needed to be given and then, humiliatingly, peeped agreement when the Fine Gael Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, saw fit to come out and call it.  I suggest the Labour Party stands humiliated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600049#WW00200","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1395853200,"counter":689,"content":"<p>When the whistleblowers Sergeant Maurice McCabe and John Wilson approached Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace who, in turn, approached Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan and me, they stated the abuses of the penalty points system were the visible tip of the iceberg of possible malpractice and corruption within sections or elements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They have not only been vindicated through the report of the Garda Inspectorate on what they raised regarding penalty points but also on the wider and more serious issues that have come to light in the past 15 months or so and which will come to light again in the coming months.  From very bad experiences, very good things can emerge.  Points have been made in this Chamber on the cases the aforementioned Deputies have heard from individuals and families about their experiences at the hands of a section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They would make the hair on the back of one's head stand on end.  They are frightening and one would swear one was reading some of the accounts from a book of nightmares.  However, the positive outcome is that all those isolated individuals who could not see beyond the four walls of their homes have begun to get organised and set up the Justice4all campaign, where they can work together, raise their issues and call for justice in the longer term.<\/p><p>  I thank the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and former Commissioner Callinan for doing some service to the State.  They could have welcomed the actions of the whistleblowers and then quietly buried the penalty points issue with the O'Mahoney whitewash.  Instead, in their arrogance, they attempted to denigrate and discredit the whistleblowers and elected public representatives who had raised these important questions.  Their dismissive sneering attitude led them into a monumental cock-up which exposed serious issues within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is not just the Minister who should take responsibility, as he has been fully supported in his approach up until today by the Taoiseach and members of the Cabinet.  Labour Party members of the Cabinet had nothing to say for 15 months on this issue and only found their voice after the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, raised the issue last week - fair play to him - and stated the men concerned should be classed as distinguished, not disgusting.  This was followed for four to five days by Labour Party Ministers appearing all over the media and stating it would be helpful if former Commissioner Callinan and the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, corrected the record of the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>However, since Monday, we have been back to the same old, same old - the silence of the lambs, from whom there has not been a whisper.  <\/p><p> The Minister's head over heels about-turn in the D&aacute;il today is welcome, but we cannot have confidence in a Minister who handled this issue in the way he handled it in the past 15 months.  He should do the decent thing and follow ex-Commissioner Callinan.  Last July there was an opportunity to deal decisively with the issue and put accountability and oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a proper footing through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Bill 2013 which was introduced by Deputy Mick Wallace with the support of the Technical Group.  It called for the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na independent board, with monitoring, supervisory and oversight functions, over An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This would be an important step in strengthening the democratic accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is necessary to promote public confidence and trust in the force.  It also called for the independence and impartiality of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to be strengthened by amending the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  It was a very important Bill which was dismissed from the Government benches, but we are now in a situation where the Government is calling for an independent policing board.  <\/p><p> I will repeat a point I have made in the D&aacute;il a number of times.  By international standards, we do not have a corrupt Garda force.  Those of us who have raised and pursued these issues do so on the basis that all State agencies have to be fully accountable to best serve the interests of the public and those who work in them.  That is the reason this has been an important issue in the past few months.  <\/p><p> I spoke to former garda John Wilson on Monday when he left hospital.  I wish him well in his fight against his illness, as, I am sure, does everyone in the Chamber.  He said that, at that point, any apology from former Commissioner Callinan or the Minister would correct the D&aacute;il record but it would not be made in the true sense.  Like thousands of others, he feels the Minister should go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600049#WW00300","speaker":"1032","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395853800,"counter":691,"content":"<p>It is important to note that the fixed charge notice and penalty points system has operated extremely well since its introduction in 2002 and enjoyed widespread public support.

The information provided by Sergeant McCabe was passed to the Department of Justice and Equality for investigation.  As we are all aware, the allegations were investigated by Assistant Garda Commissioner O'Mahoney and his report was concluded in March 2013.  In May last year the Minister for Justice and Equality referred the O'Mahoney report and another report conducted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na professional standards unit to the Garda Inspectorate asking that the inspectorate carry out a full review.  The inspectorate's report which we are debating today is entitled, The Fixed Charge Processing System - A 21st Century Strategy, and was brought to Cabinet two weeks ago on 12 March.  The first recommendation made in the report is that a criminal justice working group be established to oversee and facilitate the implementation of the report's recommendations.  The group which is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality held its second meeting yesterday.  It will report progress on a regular basis to me and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  <\/p><p>  The penalty points system was introduced under the Road Traffic Act 2002.  The main goal of the system is not to penalise people but rather to make them more aware of unsafe driving behaviour, to influence and improve driver behaviour and to reduce the numbers of deaths and serious injuries on the roads.  With the acceptance of the system by the general road user community and its importance to road safety, it is imperative that a credible and properly administrated system is in place.<\/p><p>  The year 2012 marked the tenth anniversary of the penalty points system and I decided this milestone provided an appropriate point at which to conduct a comprehensive review of the whole system and identify any change necessary.  The review of the system which my Department conducted made recommendations for the introduction of new offences, changes to the number of penalty points and other matters.  When it was completed, I forwarded its contents to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications for its consideration.  The committee made a number of very helpful suggestions which are reflected in the new Road Traffic Act 2014 which was signed into law on 25 February.  The offences where penalty points are being increased include speeding, driving while holding a mobile phone, dangerous overtaking, failure to obey traffic lights and driving without an NCT certificate.  The new penalty points offences include non-display of an L plate or an N plate, contravention of rules at mini-roundabouts and a failure to respect a Stop sign.  I pay tribute to rank and file garda&iacute; up and down the country who properly implement the traffic laws in all weather conditions and at all times of the day and night.  It is one of the tragedies of this whole affair that their good and continuing work and reputation have been sullied by the inappropriate behaviour of a few.<\/p><p>  There is little point in improving or increasing the number of penalty points offences or enforcing the system if there is a lack of trust in how the system operates.  Following recent revelations and the findings of the Garda Inspectorate, it is essential that any fault in the system is rectified and that we have a robust and credible system in place.  This will be done.<\/p><p>  The inspectorate's report makes 37 recommendations, some of which can be implemented now, while others will take a little time.  The report was eloquent and found inconsistent and widespread breaches of policy by those charged with administering it and found no meaningful evidence of consistent quality management supervision, training and clear policy guidelines for its implementation.  The report also found that there was no auditing of the cancellation process, either at Garda headquarters, regional, divisional or district level or at any level which would have identified these problems.  That, of course, is a matter of concern for us all.  The working group will ensure all of the recommendations made are implemented in the fastest possible timeframe.  Many changes have been implemented since the O'Mahoney report was published.  All of the key agencies involved are members of the group and they will work together to bring about improvements in the system and address the shortcomings highlighted in each of the studies conducted to date.  <\/p><p>  I am aware that garda&iacute; have made considerable strides in putting in place measures identified in the inspectorate's report.  These can and shall be acted on immediately.  Work has also begun on recommendations that can be implemented in a matter of weeks and a plan of action has been agreed on those recommendations that require further consideration and, in one case or two cases, may require legislation.  One measure referred to which I consider to be a very high priority is the so-called third payment option.  A provision is included in the Road Traffic Act 2010 that allows someone served with a summons related to a fixed charge penalty points offence to pay the amount involved up to seven days before his or her scheduled court appearance.  The introduction of this option will save a lot of court time, as well as Garda time.  However, it has not yet been possible to commence it because the administrative structure for dealing with it is not yet in place.  I understand garda&iacute; have now agreed, in principle, to operate this system, but a number of administrative and technical matters have still to be resolved.  When in place, the third payment option will bring about a significant improvement in the overall fixed charged notice system.  <\/p><p>  One of the major objectives of the new improved system must be to ensure penalty points are assigned in all cases where a traffic offence has been committed.  A number of gaps in legislation have been identified and addressed in recent years.  The definition of a driver's licence, for example, has been extended to include foreign licence holders.  Drivers charged with an offence are now required to provide a copy of their licence for the court, but, unfortunately, in some cases, that does not appear to be happening.  The Courts Service and the Garda are taking steps to ensure those persons who do not produce a licence are pursued and prosecuted.  Some other matters remain to be dealt with and they will be addressed in the near future.  <\/p><p>  Chief Inspector Olson said in his report that the solution was entirely dependent on co-ordinated collaboration between the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda, the Road Safety Authority, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Courts Service, An Post and various appointed contractors involved in the operation of the fixed charge processing system.<\/p><p>I fully agree with Chief Inspector Olson and am committed to ensuring that my Department engages actively with all parties to make sure the recommendations are implemented in full and with speed.<\/p><p> Finally, I would like to say something about the events of recent days and the whole issue of the possible unlawful taping of phone calls to and from Garda stations.  Needless to say, this revelation came as quite a shock to the Government, but we acted quickly, if not immediately, by establishing a commission of inquiry.  This is not a government that sweeps things under the carpet.  That era is over, and if I have anything to do with it I will make sure that is the case.  A series of controversies now surround the Garda, from bugging, tapes and collusion to penalty points, but the Government is now acting.  The Cabinet decided there would be an open competition for the post of Garda Commissioner and that a new Garda authority would be established, providing better oversight of Garda operations.  This is a very big change.  The reforms will take time, but in the meantime I ask the public to continue to support and trust rank and file garda&iacute;.  They are the ones we meet across the counter, who walk the beat; they are the ones who work day and night, in all sorts of weather, and occasionally put their lives at risk.  They are not to blame for any of this, in any way, and they deserve our continued support and trust.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600050#XX00200","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395854400,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  At the outset I must say that I bear the Minister no ill will on a personal basis or in a professional capacity.  He is somebody whom I have observed over the years and I have considerable regard for his intellect, his work rate and many other attributes that he has displayed.  Unfortunately, however, his handling of this particular issue on this occasion has been disturbing.  It is deeply disturbing that we are here today and that the Minister has held out until now in issuing an apology to two people who, in the words of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, have done the State some service, and whose actions were &quot;distinguished&quot;.  I support the position of the Minister's colleague, Deputy Varadkar, in that regard.  Even the Minister's apology today was less than wholesome.  He said, in the context of the charge that was made that the whistleblowers did not co-operate, that he apologised to both and wished to &quot;withdraw the statements made&quot;.  He went on to say that it was never his intention &quot;to cause any upset and, if any upset was caused...&quot; but there was no need for that qualification.  Upset was clearly caused in that case.  At a later stage, the Minister went on to apologise for any offence that &quot;may have been caused by any other remarks made by me&quot;.  The Minister's use of the word &quot;may&quot; is something that I find difficult to accept, although the Minister is not unique in this regard.  Some of his colleagues and some former Ministers from various parties, including my own, have sought to qualify apologies.  It does no service to the Minister or to anyone else who seeks to find refuge in that kind of qualification.  I am disappointed that the Minister chose to use that language.  The Minister has accepted the evidence that has been presented that the whistleblowers acted in good faith, did not seek not to co-operate and would have co-operated with the O'Mahoney investigation had they been given an opportunity to do so and that, therefore, his statements were incorrect at the time.<\/p><p>  However, there is still an outstanding matter here.  While I know Deputy Wallace is well able to speak for himself, I find it quite unbelievable that, to date, the Minister has not apologised for his actions concerning that Deputy.  In fact, if there is a resigning matter in all of this, it is the fact that the Minister used privileged information that was provided to him by the Garda Commissioner in a private briefing session to seek to gain some level of political advantage.  To me, that is where the absolute wrong was committed by the Minister.  In his failure to recognise the evidence and to apologise, it could be argued that the Minister was lethargic in coming to the conclusion that he got it wrong.  He sought to get evidence to support the position he had taken at the outset and finally, when it was abundantly clear to him that he was wrong, he issued the apology.  However, from the very start, somebody with the Minister's intellect and legal training, who understands the burden of the office he occupies, should clearly have known that to divulge any information provided to him in his capacity as Minister for Justice and Equality in order to gain political advantage was wrong.  It was absolutely wrong.  If the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources obtained information regarding an exploration or the potential for oil to be found in some part of the country and, as a result of that information, sought to buy shares in the company, he would be sacked immediately because he would have used privileged information available to him by virtue of his office to gain personal advantage.  I do not see any difference between that action and the action the Minister for Justice and Equality took in terms of using the information that was provided to him.  He did so to gain political advantage for himself, to make himself appear better than Deputy Wallace and to enable him to win an argument within the political sphere.  The other action would have been financial, while the Minister's actions were political, and I do not see the difference.  <\/p><p>  I wish to quote from the Code of Conduct for Office Holders, of which the Minister, as an office holder, is well aware.  It reads as follows: <blockquote>In accordance with the provisions of the Ethics Acts, office holders shall, in so far as it is relevant, have regard to and be guided by the Code in the performance of<br \/><br \/>their functions and in relation to any other matters specified in the Code.  This Code seeks to ensure that office holders must at all times observe, and be seen to observe, the highest standards of ethical behaviour in the carrying out of the functions of their office.  Office holders are obliged to act in accordance with advice given and guidelines published by the Standards in Public Office Commission (Standards Commission) unless to do so would constitute a contravention of another provision of the Ethics Acts.  Pursuant to Section 10(8) of the 2001 Act, codes of conduct will be admissible in proceedings before a Court or other tribunal or a Committee or the Standards Commission and any relevant provision may be taken into account in determining a matter.<\/blockquote>That sets out the framework from which one starts.  It is very clearly laid out.  Section 1.4 of the code makes reference to the principles of ethical conduct and reads as follows: <blockquote>Holders of public office have a duty to keep faith with the public trust placed in them by the manner in which they carry out their official responsibilities.  This is a personal responsibility and requires them at all times to promote the common good, fairly and impartially, to conscientiously and prudently apply the resources of their office in furtherance of the public interest and to observe the highest ethical standards in the performance of their duties.<br \/><br \/>  The Standards Commission has described ethical behaviour in the following terms<br \/><br \/><i>  &ldquo;A successful ethics regime is one which provides mechanisms whereby the sensitivities of political\/public life can be handled, where competing interests can be reconciled and where individual legislators\/executives can be guided in their difficult decisions by reference to the general principle that the public interest should always take precedence over the interests of the individual and, perhaps more importantly, over the interests of a political party whether in power or in opposition.&rdquo;<\/i><\/blockquote>My reading of what the Standards Commission has adjudged leaves the Minister's pretence and his failure to recognise his wrongdoing on very thin ice indeed.  I believe the Minister needs to address that in the fullness of time.  Taking into account the Minister's intellect, which I have praised and recognised, the Minister leaves himself with no other option but to resign.  <\/p><p>  We also have the farcical situation in which the Taoiseach has involved himself.  He sidelined the Minister on Sunday.  I do not claim to know what had the Taoiseach in Dublin or why he was minded to make contact with the Attorney General, but there is one thing I will give the Taoiseach credit for - he is politically astute.  Whatever by-the-way remark was made by the Attorney General, when she indicated that there was some other issue of some relevance and that she could not talk about it over the phone, as he told us, if it was of such relevance, one would assume that she would have communicated it to Government previously.  It seems to me that it was a by-the-way remark and the Taoiseach capitalised on it, from a political perspective, very quickly.  He knew that if he had another issue, he had the Labour Party backed into a corner.  The manoeuvring of the Taoiseach over the last two days was a classic case of political expediency, for which he may be caught out in the future.  It has certainly backed the Labour Party into a corner, because the Taoiseach now has something on the Attorney General.  It appears that she had been aware since last November of the information that is now of such serious import.<\/p><p>With the Attorney General and the Labour Party on the back foot, it protects the Minister because, as the biblical adage goes, it would be an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth - if the Minister went, the Attorney General would too.  The Labour Party is once again joined at the hip with Fine Gael.  In the fullness of time, the public will see the importance of the issue around the bugging of phones or the recordings made in Garda stations.  However, it is not of such significant interest.  Instead, it is being used to wrap another shield around the Minister.<\/p><p> There have a been a series of resignations on the Minister&rsquo;s watch.  He never really dealt with the resignation of the Garda confidential recipient.  The chief executive officer of the Road Safety Authority, Noel Brett, has gone, exasperated with the Minister&rsquo;s inability to provide an appropriate level of funding to the police force to carry out the kind of enforcement necessary to continue the reduction in road traffic fatalities.  The Minister himself recognised earlier that there has been an increase in road deaths.  John Wilson effectively took to the ditch and had to resign from the force.  The Commissioner is now gone.  Who next?  Today on local radio, some of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues were prepared to push the blame on to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It was he who failed, they argued, to bring the information to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  The Minister also tried it with the Attorney General.  The Minister puts all these people on the periphery while he continues to defend, protect and preserve his own personal interest over the interests of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the administration of justice in the State.  The stability of the Government has been put at issue over the past several days to protect the Minister.  It is bizarre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600051#YY00200","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395855000,"counter":695,"content":"<p>The fixed charge processing and penalty points system have saved lives and are vital to our road safety.  It is also vital, however, that citizens have full confidence in the systems.  Will the Minister put on the record again not just the number of lives on our roads that have been saved but the massive reduction in traumatic road traffic injuries over the past several years because of the system?<\/p><p>  What will happen next?  It is quite possible that we will be back in the Chamber next week with Opposition Members demanding the Minister give more powers to the Garda to control crime.  The difficulty for the Minister is striking the right balance between giving new powers to the Garda and dealing with its existing powers.  Concerns have been raised about the weakness of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and whether it has the resources and legislative provisions to do its job properly.  I am glad the Minister said he would deal with this issue swiftly.<\/p><p>  There is no organisation in this country that is without its rotten apples.  The Garda is no different.  While we will never eradicate this problem, we must ensure we minimise it as best we can to reduce the harm that a few bad apples can do to this fine organisation.  In all of my professional dealings with the Garda, I find it an extremely dedicated organisation not just in fighting crime but in dealing with child protection issues and domestic violence.  I find the empathy of individual garda&iacute; incredible, along with their commitment to their job, when one considers that dealing with such issues can lead to burnout.<\/p><p>  Earlier, Deputy McGuinness claimed that the culture of the force caused the events we have been discussing today and over the past several weeks, as well as the condemnation of the two whistleblowers.  It is a culture that has existed for longer than the three years of this Government&rsquo;s tenure.  In fact, it existed during the 15-year tenure in government of Deputy McGuinness&rsquo;s party, when it talked about looking after whistleblower legislation but did nothing.  It actually butchered the freedom of information legislation when it was in power, contributing more to that culture of secrecy and of what others describe as putting loyalty above the truth.  I am glad that tonight we are starting this journey of making a difference in how our Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be run.<\/p><p>  It is important that a strong Garda supervisory authority is formed which balances the rights of citizens with the operation of the Garda, and that garda&iacute; feel comfortable in doing their job.  However, it is not a simple sort of authority that can be drawn up overnight.  What we can do in the short term is to give the extra resources and additional legislative support that GSOC needs.  The time people are waiting for cases to be dealt with at GSOC is lengthening.  It is important, so as to maintain the trust and confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that those who guard the guards have the resources they need to do their job properly.  I would have expected there to be more support for and discussion as to what is actually needed for GSOC.  There is a need to restore people&rsquo;s confidence in what is happening in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  Many members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na feel battered and bruised by what has happened over the past several months.  They feel their organisation, of which they are very proud, has taken a hammering, along with the people&rsquo;s confidence in it and how it is perceived.  Confidence in and the perception of the force must be restored forthwith.  Will the Minister swiftly bring forward urgent legislation to strengthen GSOC&rsquo;s resources to allow it get on with its job?  Will he also bring forward his proposals for a Garda authority so it can be debated in the House and begin the process of restoring the people&rsquo;s confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?<\/p><p>  There is a massive need for a cultural change within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To some degree it has been protected from cultural change because of the strains it faces in fighting crime.  For many years, the force fought the significant threat to the stability of the State from the IRA at the height of its activities.  Over the past several years, it has taken the brunt of the fight against organised crime and a drug culture which, to some degree, has taken hold in our society.  Garda&iacute; have been battling these with reduced resources.  One can see why bad practices slip in, whereby some individuals with low morals in how they carry out their jobs get away with such practices.  There is a need for us to take on that culture and make it change.  The majority of garda&iacute; are completely committed and dedicated to their jobs and would be very much behind what we are calling for tonight.<\/p><p>  I always expect these political charges and the toing and froing along with the distortions of what actually happened.  That is what we do in this Chamber.  However, if people delve down into what is actually happening, they will see the need for change in how the Garda works, as well as how we strike the balance between letting garda&iacute; do their job and examining how they do it.<\/p><p>  The penalty points system requires a significant review.  I am glad the Minister has taken on board some changes as to how it will work.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is correct that it needs to be examined and changed.<\/p><p>  I want to put on the record a matter concerning myself, in case it is brought up at a later point and it is claimed that I never referred to it.<\/p><p>This day last week, I myself was in court in regard to a fixed penalty points notice.  It was a strange situation as I had no recollection of receiving a notice in regard to the fixed notice penalty points.  I went into the court and explained that to the judge and he took on board what I said and the charge was struck out.  Neither the fine nor the two penalty points that would have applied had I received the letter were imposed.  I find it unusual that this sort of thing can happen and that people may not receive the correspondence.  Something must be done in this regard so that if people must go to court, they will at least receive the two penalty points and the fine they should pay.  This and other changes must come into play when it comes to doing a full review of the penalty points system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1095","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395855600,"counter":697,"content":"<p>Is trua nach bhfuil an tAire Shatter anseo mar is chuige at&aacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo d&iacute;rithe.

For two men within an organisation renowned for its collegiality and its closing of ranks when under attack to try to expose within the organisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that there was a problem with the penalty points system was courageous.  For them to continue having been rebuked was courageous.  Instead of undermining them, dismissing them or attacking their characters, as happened in recent months, both by the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, they should have been praised from the start.<\/p><p>  They were whistleblowers who should have been put up as an example to others, because through their actions they have managed to expose major flaws within the system.  They have managed to expose malpractice and corruption within the penalty points system.  However, their reward from within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a living disgrace.  I do not know whether everybody has seen the harrowing account on television recently by former garda John Wilson.  Even at this late stage, those who have not watched it should watch it and see how this man's health was broken by the controversy and as a result of how he and his colleague, Maurice McCabe, were treated.  In his account he told how he was victimised and harassed within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A dead rat was hung from his door, he was arrested in public and was ostracised and sent on fool's errands around the county.  His health broke because of this and he believes he has suffered a severe consequence as a result. <\/p><p>  Nobody can say these were not courageous men.  This should not have happened to them, but it did and as yet I have not heard anybody say that what happened to them was wrong.  As far as I am aware, sanctions imposed against Sergeant Maurice McCabe within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have not been lifted to date.  They should be lifted forthwith.  There should be recognition within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that what happened was wrong and that the sanctions should never have been imposed on somebody who had the interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the penalty points system at heart from day one.  If we had other courageous men and women like these two men in other organisations to highlight wrongdoing within those organisations, we would have a better society.  These two men stood out, not only against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all its members, but also against the Department of Justice and Equality and the Minister because they believed they were right.  They have been vindicated as having been right, but that vindication has not been fully validated by the Minister.<\/p><p>  One of the big questions I have in regard to all of this concerns how Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney got it so wrong, particularly when we consider the Comptroller and Auditor General's initial account and the subsequent account following the O'Mahoney report, the report of the Garda Inspectorate.  These exposed major failings.  They state there were consistent and widespread breaches of policy by those charged with administering the penalty points system.  This totally contradicts the O'Mahoney report.  The Garda Inspectorate report also stated that the accumulation of fixes over the years resulted in a technically deficient managerially uncoordinated and inefficient support system.  <\/p><p>  The Garda Inspectorate report made major recommendations and, thankfully, some of those are being acted on already.  I acknowledge the Minister's hand in that and acknowledge his role and that of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Varadkar, in recognising the system needed to be changed.  However, this could have happened five years ago.  If these men were listened to five years ago, we would be in a far better place at this stage and their health might not have been affected.<\/p><p>  What are the consequences for the assistant commissioner for such a shoddy piece of work?  Does the Minister back the report of the assistant commissioner now?  We are led to believe there is a new era of transparency and that the era of the nod and the wink and the backhanders is gone.<\/p><p>I have heard the Minister saying that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be beyond reproach, but that has not been the case here.  In the Minister's summing up and question and answer session he should have the courage not just to apologise but to admit that he was wrong in his approach to these men from day one.  He should admit that there have been consequences for their lives and, in one case at least, for their health and that he will do his damnedest to make his mistakes right.

Without that level of trust, a police force has no moral power and the citizen is no longer adequately protected by the State.  In Ireland that sense of trust between citizen and police ran so deep for so long that our Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been able to retain its rare status of being one of the last unarmed police forces in the world.  That trust is a precious aspect of Irish society and it behoves every Member of this House as democratic representatives of Irish citizens to do whatever is necessary to protect for the people of Ireland and the integrity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We owe that to the people and to the members of the Garda force.<\/p><p>  On 19 February I stated in this House that it was no longer appropriate for the Garda Commissioner to report to the Minister for Justice and Equality, if it ever had been.  It sometimes takes a little while in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a good idea to gain currency but I am pleased that out of this whole sorry mess there is at least one seed of hope.  Yesterday's decision by the Cabinet to establish a new policing authority is good news.  It will be important for the new authority to have the right balance of international policing skills with community and democratic representation.  We can learn much from other police jurisdictions about this.  I would welcome a reciprocal presence of at least one shared board member who sits on policing authorities both North and South of the Border.<\/p><p>  In my role on the justice committee I look forward to developing further, within the review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, concepts such as the policing authority and the strengthened role of GSOC.  However, as well as the complex and strategic organisational change that is ahead we need to consider the proper resourcing of the force.  The substantial financial revenue that will be recovered by fixing the flaws in the penalty points system should be initially reinvested in the resourcing of the Garda to create a modern policing system that is fit for purpose.<\/p><p>  On appointment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, each member swears an oath.  Most of the 13,000 serving garda&iacute; and the majority of the thousands of retired garda&iacute; made their oaths in good faith and have conducted their working lives in accordance with that pledge.  Given all that has happened over the past few weeks, it is worth reminding the House of the words of the Garda solemn declaration as sworn by every new garda: &quot;I will faithfully discharge the duties ... with fairness, integrity, regard for human rights, diligence and impartiality, upholding the Constitution and the laws and according equal respect to all people.&quot;<\/p><p>  Does this oath that swears regard for human rights give scope to a member of the force to retain the details of an innocent two-year-old Traveller child on its criminal surveillance data recording system?  It most certainly does not.  Does the Garda oath that swears fairness, integrity, legal compliance and upholding of the Constitution give scope to a member of the force to illegally and secretly tape-record privileged, confidential client-solicitor conversations?  Of course it does not.  Does the oath to uphold integrity and fairness leave scope for the rampant abuse of the fixed charge processing system in the manner described by the report of the Garda Inspectorate?  Any Garda I know would answer &quot;no&quot; to all of those questions.<\/p><p>  We need to get back to a place where the Garda oath is respected by those at the top of the tree as highly as it is regarded by those at the bottom.  It is not enough for our garda&iacute; individually to know the difference between right and wrong, yet maintain silence in the face of an injustice committed by a colleague.  We need a Garda culture that applauds and welcomes those members of the force who put their hands up to highlight wrongdoing.  That is the real challenge for the next Garda Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600054#BBB00400","speaker":"1105"},{"type":"speech","time":1395856200,"counter":702,"content":"<p>I commend the Garda Inspectorate on its report.  It has done the State a considerable service in producing a very detailed report with a long list of recommendations.  I thank and commend the Minister, Deputy Shatter, on having commissioned that report.  In an attempt to politicise this debate it has been overlooked that the Minister, Deputy Shatter commissioned the report at a time when much less controversy surrounded this issue.  The report completely vindicates the whistleblowers and the role they played, saying but for the amount of public scrutiny that was on the fixed points penalty system none of this would have arisen.  That public scrutiny arose out of the fact that those whistleblowers did what they did.  They did what they did because they felt no other option was open to them.  It is very important that this House, this system of government and this Government vindicates whistleblowers.  I have every confidence that the Government and Legislature will do so in the form of legislation which has already passed Second Stage in this House, to the debate on which many of us had the opportunity to contribute.<\/p><p>  The report of the Garda Inspectorate vindicated to an extent the role of whistleblowers, particularly stating that this issue would not have been examined but for the public controversy and scrutiny which arose.  I am not surprised and am very glad to note that the Minister, Deputy Shatter today put on the record of the House a clarification on the role of whistleblowers, and the two whistleblowers in particular.  I greatly welcome that.  One of the main recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate was that the Department of Justice and Equality immediately convene a chair of a criminal justice working group comprising the Department of Justice and Equality, the Courts Service, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Road Safety Authority to oversee and facilitate the implementation of the recommendations in this report.  It is key that all those recommendations be implemented to ensure public confidence is restored in the fixed point penalty system.<\/p><p>  Like all issues, the story has moved on somewhat, and very quickly, since this report was published to yesterday's Government statement that a statutory commission of investigation is being established to examine the surveillance of telephone calls in and out of Garda stations.  That came as a major shock to many people in this country, perhaps especially to members of the legal community, many of whom were on television last night, who would have been making and receiving telephone calls to and from those Garda stations.  It is in the public domain that Ennis Garda station was among many stations which were the subject of an eTenders notice in 2007 for the provision of surveillance equipment.<\/p><p>It is a complete shock to know that surveillance equipment was used to monitor telephone calls in and out of the Garda station.  Clearly, the expenditure of public funds was authorised for the provision of that surveillance system in 2007, and among the issues to be examined by the commission of investigation is who cleared the expenditure, who knew the expenditure would be taken by the State and, most importantly, who knew what the surveillance equipment would be used for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600054#BBB00500","speaker":"977","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395856800,"counter":704,"content":"<p>The next slot is to be shared by Deputies Pringle and Finian McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600055#CCC00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1395856800,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this evening's debate on the Garda Inspectorate report.  The Minister finally, belatedly, gave a conditional apology today for impugning the integrity of two fine Garda officers.  He stated: \"If any upset was caused I hope that correcting the record today will put the matter to rest\", and continued by stating \"I apologise for any offence that may have been caused\".  This apology does not have much meaning, as the Minister was backed into a corner before he would apologise, and the act was in no way sincere.  The Labour Party trumpets itself as the watchdog of the Government, but it took a Fine Gael Minister to call on the Minister for Justice and Equality and former Garda Commissioner Callinan to retract statements which sparked the series of events that have led to this.<\/p><p>  Was that the case? It now appears obvious that the revelations about the bugging of Garda stations are what forced the Garda Commissioner's resignation.  I wonder, if the imminent disclosure of the transcripts of bugged phone calls through discovery in the courts was not happening, whether we would even be hearing about this issue.  The Minister's position is untenable because of his dealings with the whistleblowers - notwithstanding the conditional apology - as well as his undermining of GSOC, his use of confidential information against Deputy Wallace and now the taped phone calls at Garda stations.  These indicate that the Minister is not the person to lead the Department.<\/p><p>  The whistleblowers have been vindicated by the report of the inspectorate and not the Minister's statement.  Because of this report they are now beyond reproach, if there was anyone, bar the Minister and the former Garda Commissioner, who did not believe them.  Garda John Wilson and Sergeant Maurice McCabe made accurate claims regarding grave wrongdoings in the fixed charge processing system.  Not only that, but they went through the proper channels, contrary to what the Minister stated in the D&aacute;il at the time when he argued that the whistleblowers did not co-operate with an internal Garda inquiry on penalty point cancellations.<\/p><p>  The inspectorate report states: &quot;The inspectorate was told by senior Garda staff, that but for the public scrutiny, the extent of the deficiencies within the fixed charge processing system would not have been detected.&quot;  That is not down to anything done by the Minister about these allegations but rather to the proper work carried out by the Garda whistleblowers.  It is now up to the criminal justice working group, made up of all the fixed charge penalty points system stakeholders, to oversee and facilitate the implementation of the recommendations in the report.  Judging by its content, there is much work to be done to rectify the shambles that is the fixed charge penalty system.<\/p><p>  It turns out that Letterkenny Garda station in Donegal was one of 27 stations for which garda&iacute; in 2007 sought a system to automatically record telephone calls and radio traffic.  Will we now see convictions being overturned because of the illegal operation of the system in Donegal and other parts of the country?  We can consider that the Morris tribunal into the activities of some garda&iacute; in Donegal heard evidence that garda&iacute; had bugged the station to listen to the conversations of detainees and people who were wrongly arrested.  These activities were known for a long time.  I remember at the time of the Morris tribunal that the only concern in official circles was to ensure that it was emphasised that this was a Donegal problem and existed nowhere else in the country.  That was a lost opportunity for real and meaningful change in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  Reform from the top down is required to boost the morale of the force.  An independent Garda authority would go some way towards introducing accountability, but the future appointment of commissioners must be examined as part of an overall reform.  We know there is so much more to this, and overall reform is required with increased transparency and accountability.  There are still many questions that need to be answered.  I do not believe this is the Minister to guide the needed reforms through, and by his actions he has shown he is not fit to carry them out.  I recognise the fantastic job that the vast majority of garda&iacute; do on a daily basis in these hard times, but we also know that much change is needed now, on a much wider scale than we could have ever imagined, so that the force can do the job it was supposed to be doing all along.  Those many garda&iacute; working conscientiously to deliver effective policing deserve proper reform of the organisation.  They need that new start now and they deserve the chance for it to happen under new leadership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600055#CCC00300","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1395856800,"counter":706,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak in this important debate on the Garda Inspectorate report on the fixed charge penalty processing system.

I wish him and his family the best.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, stated:<blockquote>...any use of Garda discretion to effect the termination of fixed charge notices must be applied in a fair, impartial and transparent manner and on 15 May 2013, I published seven crucial applicable principles to ensure this.  They are as follows: 1. There must be no question mark hanging over the integrity of the fixed charge notice system and in the application of penalty points; 2. No individual should receive preferential treatment because of his or her perceived status, relationship or celebrity; 3. The law and any discretionary application of it to individuals must be administered fairly and with compassion and common sense; 4. No member of the Garda should feel compelled by a person's position, relationship or celebrity status to treat that person any more or less favourably than any other person; 5. There must be proper oversight and transparency to the discretionary decision making process and the applicable rules and procedures must be fully complied with; 6. All statutory provisions, regulations, rules, protocols and procedures applicable to the termination of fixed charge notices must be readily accessible to all members of the Garda and the circumstances, factors and procedures applicable to the termination of fixed charge notices should be detailed clearly on the Garda website for the information of members of the public; and, 7. Where application is made to terminate a fixed ticket charge, where possible and appropriate, material to support any application made should be sought while understanding in some circumstances no such material may exist or be obtainable.  These principles were applied by the Garda Inspectorate ... it is unacceptable for any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to use his or her discretion in regard to the cancellation of fixed charge notices or penalty points other than in a fair and impartial manner in accordance with the criteria which apply.<\/blockquote>The whistleblower plays an important role:<blockquote>...in highlighting problems and helping to bring about real change.  The most serious allegations specifically made relating to the fixed charge processing system and penalty points related to what were described as: shocking criminality by several Garda officers; serious fraud and corruption within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; perversion of the course of justice by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; Garda inspectors and superintendents perverting the course of justice on a massive scale; at least seven road fatalities resulting from the termination of fixed charge notices; hundreds of official Garda PULSE records altered and destroyed; and an allegation that the Garda had no discretionary power whatsoever to cancel notices.<\/blockquote>There is to be an independent review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road agreement.  The terms of reference are: <blockquote>To review and make recommendations on the use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the resources available to it, with the objective of achieving and maintaining the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in its operation and administration.<br \/><br \/>  The review shall encompass all aspects of the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including&ndash;- the structure, organisation and staffing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;<br \/><br \/>- the deployment of members and civilian staff to relevant and appropriate roles;<br \/><br \/>- the remuneration and conditions of service of  members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including an evaluation of  annualised hours\/shift pay arrangements;<br \/><br \/>- the appropriate structures and mechanism for the future resolution of matters relating to pay, industrial relations and attendance matters.<\/blockquote>The other part of the review - dealing with efficiency, effectiveness, structure, organisation, staffing and deployment - will be carried out by the Garda Inspectorate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600056#DDD00800","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1395857400,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I come from a family that is very proud of the integrity, professionalism and dedication of garda&iacute;.

I have four penalty points.  I had six.  This time next year I hope to be down to two and in 2016, before the next general election, I hope to be canvassing with none.  Two points is two too many.  I probably drove too fast and I took the charge.  Nobody should be able to escape penalty points.  That is only fair.  I was given two, if not four, of my penalty points on the Lucan Road.  I was driving to Leinster House at 6 p.m. for a vote.  The speed limit goes from 80 kph to 60 kph before coming to the M50, which I think is unfair, and I was pulled in by garda&iacute;.  I gave them my name and was given two points.  I could have said I was on the way to vote in the D&aacute;il.  I cannot understand why that law still applies because, unlike my constituency colleague who was not travelling to Leinster House but driving around Roscommon, I think it is wrong.  However, he decided he was above the law and that it did not apply to him because he was a Deputy and well known.  That is wrong.  He said it was corrupt, yet he is one of the Independent Deputies who highlighted the issue.  He should not lecture Deputies on how to conduct their business because, in his own words, he was corrupt.  He got off and was not given four penalty points.  That is wrong. <\/p><p>  In 2005, 396 lives were lost on the roads.  In 2012, 162 lives were lost.

I am also conscious of the lack of resources across the spectrum and the fact that, as we speak, garda&iacute; and members of the Defence Forces are working in difficult situations and putting their lives on the line at home and abroad.  It is important to acknowledge that the security forces have the full backing of this House.  They should not be used as a political football.<\/p><p>  I was not going to allude to penalty points but I changed my mind after listening to Deputy Feighan, who has nearly as many penalty points as the Roscommon county football team.  We recall receiving penalty points, which are always accrued because we did 31 mph in a 30 mph zone, but we never reflect on the many penalty points we did not get even though we were speeding or breaking lights.  That is an inherent characteristic of Irish society, and the Members of this House are representative of Irish society.  Members of this House include good, decent and hard-working people but also some rogues.  It is important to realise that we are not all angels.<\/p><p>  I am a strong believer in allowing garda&iacute; to exercise discretion, provided it is done in a fair and practical manner.  With respect to the issues that have caused controversy in recent months, Chief Inspector Olson produced a thorough report which contained a large number of recommendations.  This is welcome, but how many reports have we received with recommendations that were implemented on an <i>ad hoc <\/i>basis?  It is important that the Minister provide the necessary funding to implement the inspector's recommendations.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has been a lightening rod over the past several weeks.  I do not wish to patronise him, because he does not take kindly to being patronised, but it is widely acknowledged that he is a very hard-working and reforming Minister who takes a strong interest in his portfolio.  However, viewed from the outside, great effort and time appear to be spent on image, spin and producing legislation - the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is probably one of the Ministers who are least vulnerable to this accusation - and not enough attention is given to managing Departments and ensuring legislation is implemented correctly.  Perhaps Ministers should concentrate on their jobs rather than running up and down the country to announce ten jobs in a burger joint or 200 jobs in a high-tech industry.  I am not here to attack the media, but they put the political establishment and the Government under pressure to project a good image.

His initial assessment was incorrect, as was the Minister's, but I am glad the Minister has chosen to apologise.  I welcome the intervention by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who I am sure is getting flack from his Cabinet colleagues.  That direct, fresh-air approach is needed and it should not be used as a battering ram to attack other Ministers.  It should give rise to a more open and transparent system.<\/p><p>  If the Taoiseach instructed Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality on Monday to approach the Garda Commissioner regarding the issue of taped conversations, why did he not give the letter to the Minister until the middle of the following day?  Why was the Minister out of the loop?  Can a case be made for ministerial responsibility?  Whether it is due to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste or media pressure, Ministers getting involved in areas outside their responsibility causes difficulties and confusion, with the result that people lose sight of what is required from them.<\/p><p>  It is important that Garda personnel be rotated to other tasks, particularly in respect of the drugs squad.

It is unfortunate that the group of \"others\" - the fourth group in the D&aacute;il - did not get an opportunity to comment on recent matters, because the shocking reports given to the D&aacute;il earlier today by the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, raise serious questions about the Minister and the Attorney General.  The Minister failed to deal adequately or swiftly with issues brought to his attention by Garda whistleblowers, and it now seems he is not keeping abreast of issues raised with his Department pertaining to the recording of incoming and outgoing calls to Garda stations.<\/p><p>  I have always been a strong supporter of the proposal to establish an independent Garda authority.  It was the policy of my former party, the Labour Party, for several decades, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, prepared a very fine paper on the subject while he was in Opposition.  I hope the proposals in that paper will form the nucleus of the new independent Garda authority. <\/p><p>  I welcome the report by the chief inspector of Garda Inspectorate, Mr. Bob Olson, as significant in its own right and I have studied it carefully.  For the past four or five years I have been raising the issue of the enforcement of road traffic laws and fixed charge notices.  I salute the courage and determination of Sergeant Maurice McCabe and Garda John Wilson and commend them on their service to the Irish nation.  The Garda Inspectorate report vindicates both men and the information they presented about anomalies in the penalty points system.  I welcome the Minister's correction of the record of the House this afternoon and his comments in relation to the whistleblowers' conduct.  I also commend my D&aacute;il colleagues Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly on their work in this area.  I welcome the Garda Inspectorate's recommendations on the establishment of a criminal justice working group, the updating of the fixed charge penalty system manual, the need to improve the notepad tracking system and the need to investigate the issue of penalty points offences committed in company cars or hired cars.<\/p><p>  The report deals with the 5% of penalty points notices that were removed.  The other side of the coin, as the Minister will be aware, is the failure of the courts system to impose points and the Judiciary's flagrant disregard for laws that were passed by this House.  A recent judgment by Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan in the High Court has confirmed that section 55 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 precludes District Court judges from allowing offenders to make donations to the court poor box to avoid incurring penalty points for certain road traffic offences, but this practice continues.  There was an incident recently in which a well-known business person involved in a charity avoided a conviction by paying &euro;250 to the court poor box.<\/p><p>Section 55 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 clearly states: &quot;Section 1(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 does not apply to a penalty point offence (within the meaning of section 1(1) of the Act of 2002).&quot;  The Minister has informed me in replies to parliamentary questions that 1,255 defendants in 2012 and 1,754 defendants in 2013 avoided penalty points convictions in court by making donations to the poor box.  That is an appalling lacuna.  The Minister has stated his intention to reform the law relating to the use of the court poor box with the criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill.  However, in the meantime, I urge him to ensure that there is full and proper enforcement of section 55, which was enacted by a commencement order signed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, on 1 June 2011.  This is particularly pertinent because of Mr. Justice Hogan's judgment in the case of Kennedy <i>v<\/i>. Gibbons, [2014] IEHC 67.  Significantly, Mr. Justice Hogan ruled in that case that the cumulative effects of section 55 and other provisions of the Road Traffic Act on penalty points offences were such as &quot;to override the District Court's power at common law to accept a donation to the poor box in lieu of proceeding to a formal conviction in the case of those road traffic offences which attract the application of penalty points on a mandatory basis.&quot;  Mr. Justice Hogan's judgment categorically places central importance on section 55 of the 2010 Act.  I strongly urge the Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Varadkar, to consult An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service, including by ensuring that a specific direction is sent to the President of the District Court, so that all parties are aware of the judgment and its implications, thereby ensuring that persons charged with road traffic offences attracting penalty points cannot avoid conviction by making donations to the court poor box.  This issue is just one strand of the overall fixed charge system, but it is significant and has been largely ignored.  The Minister has an opportunity here to remove that significant anomaly on that side of the penalty points issue.<\/p><p> I note that the Minister has prepared a detailed action plan on the inspectorate report and I look forward to the implementation of that report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600057#EEE00300","speaker":"1020","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395858600,"counter":722,"content":"<p>Deputy Nolan is sharing with Deputy Ciara Conway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600058#FFF00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1395858600,"counter":723,"content":"<p>Before I begin my substantive contribution, I want to acknowledge the role played by the former Commissioner, Deputy Callinan, over his distinguished 41-year career.  It did not end in the best of light, but we should not define the man, nor his record of service, by one event, one month or one year in his tenure.  He certainly did much good work for the State in his role as Garda Commissioner.  In my exchanges with him over the brief period I have been in this House, through the Committee of Public Accounts, I found him in other areas, apart from the penalty points, to be diligent in his work.  I acknowledge and commend him on that.<\/p><p>  I welcome the publication of and the debate on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report.  I acknowledge and commend the Minister for Justice and Equality on his commissioning of that report, which is a point that is often missed.  I also acknowledge the large role played by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and his team in doing much of the underlying analysis and work which form the basis upon which the report was prepared.  In fact, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which has been debated at the Committee of Public Accounts and will be the subject of a report that the committee is preparing, is one of extraordinary clarity, detail and good work, and is a real example of the public service and the organs of State doing their job extremely well.<\/p><p>  However, it must be pointed out that both the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the Garda Inspectorate report are much more damning and harsh with regard to the actions of the Garda than the report that was prepared by the assistant commissioner, Mr. O'Mahoney.  That contradiction between the internal report and the external reports points to something worthy of note: that the internal investigation was definitely not as meaningful or, perhaps, as thorough or damning as it ought to have been.<\/p><p>  For the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, this has been a particularly damaging time.  Its reputation has been tarnished and its trust has been damaged by endless headlines, allegations, reports and perceptions, be they with regard to GSOC, whistleblowers, penalty points or, now, the taping of conversations in Garda stations.  It is reported or suggested that perhaps Mill Street Garda Station in Galway could have been one of the stations involved.<\/p><p>  When I spoke to the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, on the penalty points issue at the Committee of Public Accounts, I tried to ask him what would constitute corruption in his view, because the assistant commissioner's report stated that there was no criminality or corruption, and we had a rather long interchange without any satisfactory answer being given.  I still find it difficult to accept that there was no corruption in a system which was clearly abused for the gain of others and that we have been unable to find a way of showing that.  I understand that this has been referred to GSOC to look into and it may probe it to a greater extent, and, in fact, that three members of the force have been disciplined on the basis of the O'Mahoney report, but this is something that was so widespread, according to the report, that there must have been more to it.<\/p><p>  I welcome Monday's announcement of the establishment of a Garda authority.  This provides a strong future for the Garda.  It is something that was in the Labour Party manifesto and I am glad that it has now worked its way in, through Cabinet, as a Government decision.  When up and running, it will allow for a properly functioning, transparent, public-oriented and publicly accountable Garda.  I am sure the Minister is completely committed to seeing that through.<\/p><p>  I will have to put on the record - because if I do not I will be neglecting my duty to my constituents - that there is a great deal of controversy, worry and angst with regard to the administration of justice, the Garda and, in fairness, Deputy Shatter, as Minister for Justice and Equality, and I am receiving constant telephone calls telling me that he should resign, that this is a sham, etc.  At all times, I have been able to sit down with constituents and go through it step by step.  However, it has got to the stage at which we really are in a very serious position and the public's patience is at an end.  I wanted to say to the Minister that today, on the radio, on Galway FM, I again stated that the Minister for Justice and Equality had nothing to answer for, but we are in a position of utmost good faith at this point.  If anything, following the most recent revelations over the past number of days, we are at a very high standard where we must have full disclosure.  Everything must be explained, such as why there were delays in letters, where the information was, why it did not come out and who was responsible for not delivering it.  All of this information is pertinent, and the matter is causing severe worry.  It is no longer an issue of process; it is an issue of who knew what and whether there is a cover-up.  This is what we are getting out there.  We need the utmost good faith and not merely technical correctness but for everything to be brought out and put forward in a full and transparent manner.  I had to say that to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600058#FFF00300","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speech","time":1395858600,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I commend the report of the Garda Inspectorate, which clearly vindicates the assertions of the whistleblowers.  I welcome the Minister's apology to the whistleblowers and correction of the record in this House about their alleged non-compliance with the investigation, but the fact of the matter was that they were not asked.  I am glad that the Minister has apologised to the former Garda Wilson and Sergeant McCabe in this instance.<\/p><p>  The Government decision to establish an independent Garda board is pertinent and important.  There is no doubt that this has been a long-established policy of the Labour Party.  It did not make it into the programme for Government but, as my colleague Deputy Nolan stated, I am glad that it has now made its way into Cabinet and that we have had a decision on it.<\/p><p>  The past couple of weeks and months have shaken the public in terms of how justice is administered in this country.  The vast majority of people have little interaction with the Garda.  They are law-abiding persons who go about their business and, for whatever reason, never come to the attention of the Garda.  However, we are human and fallible and sometimes our foot is on the accelerator in the car and we go too fast.  The one time we have any interaction with the Garda is when penalty points are being given out.<\/p><p>  Penalty points were introduced in this country to improve the standard of road safety because for far too long we had lost too many young lives to speeding and careless driving.  What has shaken the public in all of this scandal is the knowledge of that one time when most people interact with the Garda, which is when they receive penalty points.  The general assertion is that everybody is equal before the eyes of the law.  However, in this instance it has been clearly shown that factors such as celebrity, membership of elite groups and political status meant that some were more equal than others.  I for one am really glad that this report has come out and shown the way in which justice was being administered and the fact that there were abuses of the system.<\/p><p>For the vast majority of people, their interactions with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are at that level.<\/p><p> I will move on to the news that has broken over the past 24 hours in respect of the alleged illegal taping of conversations in Garda stations.  The Garda station in Waterford was one of them, a matter documented in court in respect of the conviction of garda&iacute;.  Going back to 2002, prior to the establishment of GSOC, reports of detection rates in Waterford Garda stations were falsely documented.  A report from the RTE website states: <blockquote>A long-awaited report on an internal Garda investigation into crime detection rates in the Waterford Garda Division has still not been completed, months after the initial allegations were made.<br \/><br \/> [I]t was claimed that some figures compiled in the Waterford Division were not accurate and that some recorded crimes were reported to have been detected, even though nobody had been charged with the offences.<\/blockquote>The report states that Waterford Garda division was reported to have considered crimes to have been detected even though no conviction or court proceedings had taken place.  If garda&iacute; were satisfied that they knew who was responsible, that was the end of it and it was considered detected.  The report also states:<blockquote>An internal Garda inquiry was set up to investigate the matter and to give an exact definition of what had or had not been &quot;detected&quot;.<br \/><br \/> A Garda spokesperson said today that the report still had not been finalised and there was no indication as to when it would be completed.<\/blockquote>The matter has not been resolved and I ask the Minister to examine this.  We now have two allegations reported in public in respect of the conduct of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Waterford: the illegal recording of telephone calls and the misrepresentation of crime detection rates as far back as 2002.  As a representative of constituents, I know that will shock the public, and we do not want to have poor relations between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and members of the public.  Even though the vast majority of us do not interact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we need to know we are safe where we live and in our communities.  I ask the Minister to take these points into consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600058#FFF00400","speaker":"1093","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395859200,"counter":726,"content":"<p>In Greek mythology, the punishment for hubris - pride, arrogance and an excessive belief in one's own capabilities and worth - was handed out by the goddess Nemesis.  In Greek tragedy, it was often the cause of the downfall of those riddled with guilt.  This Government has been collectively responsible for a significant amount of hubris since its first day in office.  However, the Minister for Justice and Equality has managed to manifest the execution of this hubris and it has come without any redeeming defect.  The Minister has spoken in the D&aacute;il over the past few days, and particularly today, with respect to the most extraordinary 48 hours in my experience in politics.  These events have come at the end of the penalty points controversy, the Minister's contemptuous attitude towards whistleblowers, the sacking of the confidential recipient, disturbing revelations of spying at GSOC and, finally, the stunning ignorance of anything to do with the latest revelations on recordings.  We have been asked to believe the incredible account that the Taoiseach gave to the House this morning concerning the timeline of the Cabinet's discovery of the recording issue.  If the Taoiseach's account is taken as true, the Attorney General has serious questions to answer in regard to her communication of vital information to the other Cabinet members.  An issue that was quickly judged by the Taoiseach and the Cabinet to be worthy of a full inquiry headed by a justice of the Supreme Court was allowed to sit on the Attorney General's desk from November of last year, apparently without her realising its seriousness.  In the end, it was only raised by the Taoiseach when he contacted her on another matter.  If he had not contacted her, how much longer would we have had to wait before she brought it to the attention of the House and the Taoiseach?  What are the lines of communication between the Attorney General and the Minister's office?  Are they functioning as they should be?  Evidently not, given the failure over four months to communicate this issue to the Minister's office.  We know that the Taoiseach, who has professed his full confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality, waited almost 24 hours before informing us of the serious issues with an aspect of the administration of justice for which he is responsible.<\/p><p>  This morning, we learnt that the Garda Commissioner resigned his position following a visit from the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality on Sunday night.  This is the same Secretary General who failed to pass on the urgent letter from the Garda Commissioner to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, until after the Commissioner had resigned.<\/p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was founded on the principle of community policing and relies on the good faith and trust of the communities.  It operates within the fabric of trust of the citizens of this country.  The handling of the penalty points controversy, the response of the Minister to the concerns of the Road Safety Authority and, particularly, his reaction to the whistleblowers has been marked not by a desire to manage the administration of justice but, rather, by a desire to crush dissent from his opinion.<\/p><p>  The interesting timing of the revelations of the past 48 hours may have overshadowed the impact of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate's report but it cannot take away from the fact that it vindicates ordinary decent people who took a brave decision to blow the whistle.  These are people with families, who are married with children and who over the past two years have carried the stigma of being labelled.  For two years we failed to act on the concerns of the whistleblowers, even after the Taoiseach passed on details of Sergeant McCabe's concerns in July 2012.  We still failed to act.  For over two years, the Minister for Justice and Equality has done nothing to address the serious allegations set out in Sergeant McCabe's dossier.  These allegations include assault, abduction and, ultimately, the brutal murder of Ms Sylvia Roche Kelly.  Nothing was done.<\/p><p>  Sergeant McCabe brought these concerns to the Garda confidential recipient, Oliver Connolly, a political supporter of the Minister, only to be told, &quot;If Shatter thinks you're screwing him, you're finished&quot;.  This is in line with the pattern of the Minister's behaviour with regard to the suppression of dissent.  The Minister has since washed his hands of the Garda confidential informant, firing him and failing to provide any explanations for Mr. Connolly's extraordinary statements to Sergeant McCabe.  His actions have resulted in the independent oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being left in complete disarray.<\/p><p>  Not only were Sergeant McCabe and the other whistleblowers subject to isolation, intimidation and having their allegations ignored; they were then subject to a disgraceful discrediting by the Minister and others.  He falsely accused Sergeant McCabe of non-co-operation with the Garda investigation when, in reality, he had not been invited to an interview in the process.  Sergeant McCabe, a decent and honourable member of the force, deserved and received an apology, although some argue it was not whole.  This apology is owed not just by the Minister but by all Ministers who continued to express support for the Minister, Deputy Shatter, while he refused to acknowledge his ill-judged comments about these decent people.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge that the Minister has corrected the record of the House and apologised for his false statements and the hurt caused to Sergeant McCabe and Mr. Wilson.  Why it took so long is another matter and one can only wonder about the pressure brought to bear on him relative to the pressure brought to bear on those decent individuals.  The silence from the Labour Party benches on this issue has been deafening.  They have long sold out on their commitments on economic matters and on their promises in the areas of disability and mental health in return for the delivery of a social agenda.  In this, they see Deputy Shatter as a key ally and turn a blind eye to his conduct in office.  This is just one more item on the long list of betrayals of the party's value system since taking office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600059#GGG00200","speaker":"1188"},{"type":"speech","time":1395859200,"counter":727,"content":"<p>These statements are on the report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate on the fixed charge processing system, and we should stick to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600059#GGG00300","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1395859200,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the commitment of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.

We have spent the past four weeks in this House discussing the successes of Government and the saga under discussion has gone on and on.  We have wasted week after week, yet the Government continues to show poor judgment and indulge in self-congratulation in respect of the programme for Government.  We have reached the point at which we will not accept any more arrogant and aggressive aloofness.  It is time for humility.  I urge the Minister to bear that in mind in contemplating Mr. Wilson and his family and Sergeant McCabe and his family.  We must bear in mind their conditions at work and the pressures that have been piled on them by this House.  They are isolated in their place of employment.  Some days they are supervised and other days they are not.  They feel unwanted by the State.

The current system is not without flaws and the new system that has been introduced is likewise not without flaws.  Under the current system one receives one fixed charge notice.  If one does not receive the fixed charge notice - we do not have an infallible postal system - the first one knows about it is when one receives a summons.  It is totally unjust that the system in place allows for a person to receive a summons in the post when a fixed charge notice has not been received and there is no ability to pay the fine.  I know people to whom that has happened.  There should be a system in place to allow one to pay the fine for so many days or weeks after one receives the summons rather than wasting the time of a court and adding to that the additional costs involved in having to appear in court and explain the situation.<\/p><p>  I have previously heard arguments as to why a proof-of-service system is not practical for the fixed charge system, but from a justice perspective, individuals need to know why they are expected to appear in court if they have not received a fixed charge notice.  The situation must be addressed as a matter of urgency because it does happen.  I know people to whom it has happened.<\/p><p>  The taping of telephone conversations in Garda stations has been going on for 30 years.  It is not the fault of the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  The Minister first became aware of the matter this week and the Taoiseach first became aware of it at the weekend.  One could ask which Minister for justice, if any, was ever aware of the recording of telephone conversations in Garda stations and whether it was sanctioned by any Minister for justice or any Garda Commissioner in the past 30 years.<\/p><p>  Given that there are only approximately 2,500 tapes &ndash; that is the information available currently &ndash; that suggests to me that the recordings were more <i>ad hoc<\/i> than systematic.  If that is the case, does it mean it was done by individual superintendents in individual Garda stations, or was it done at a higher level?  I agree the approach being taken is correct.  However, to lay blame at the door of the current Minister is the wrong place to start.  We must find out who sanctioned the recordings initially and whether it was something that developed on an individual basis in individual Garda stations.  We can start to make judgments when we find the facts but until such time as we do, we should hold back and be wary of casting aspersions on anyone.  As yet, none of us know the facts.  I could speak at length on the issue but that is all I will say at present.<\/p><p>  We need to put in place a new fixed charge processing system.  The current system of receiving a notice from Thurles is not infallible or without flaws and needs to be remedied.  The important issue is road safety, not the collection of revenue for the State, and that should be our primary focus.  We must ensure good practice and that people observe the rules of the road rather than focusing on revenue generation, which seems to be the focus of attention for many.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600060#HHH00200","speaker":"972"},{"type":"speech","time":1395859800,"counter":731,"content":"<p>The events of the past two days, with revelations of widespread institutionalised violations of civil rights by garda&iacute;, coming in the wake of the penalty points scandal and the bugging of the GSOC office, represent without question a crisis for the justice system in this State and for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coalition Government.<\/p><p>  The country is still trying to come to terms with the revelation that telephone conversations to and from Garda stations were routinely recorded for many years and under successive Garda Commissioners and successive Ministers for justice, including the current Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, and Commissioner Martin Callinan, who has now resigned.  The implications of that for the civil rights of citizens and for the integrity of the justice system are profound.  One could ask whether innocent people have been convicted of offences they did not commit as a result of that and whether guilty people will walk free because their convictions might now be found flawed on the basis of the systematic eavesdropping.<\/p><p>  The Minister&rsquo;s speech this morning did absolutely nothing to address the true depth of the crisis or to acknowledge his own central role in it.  On the contrary, he could not wait to rush through his highly questionable narrative about his knowledge of the Garda recordings before he launched into yet another of his tirades against the Opposition and those who dare to challenge his performance as Minister.  He did not even have the grace to acknowledge that there is deep public concern reflected in the Oireachtas on all sides and that the country has only begun to come to terms with the enormity of what is being revealed.  The narrative the Minister skipped over is quite incredible.  The GSOC report of June 2013 relating to phone call recording in a particular case stated: &ldquo;On consideration of the ruling of the court the Garda Commissioner may wish to re-evaluate his practice regarding the recording of such calls and the consents required if it is to be permissible to use such recordings in evidence.&rdquo;  Is it credible that the report was not noticed by the Department of Justice and Equality and that its importance and implications were not realised or brought to the attention of the Minister when it was published?  If it was brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention then he misled the D&aacute;il this morning.  If it was not brought to his attention then that is an admission of gross incompetence on the part of the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>  Is it credible that the Minister only saw the letter from the Garda Commissioner at 6 p.m. on Monday?  If that is indeed the case, it shows a truly astonishing level of incompetence, or worse, in the Department of Justice and Equality.  One could ask what it says about the role of the Attorney General and the level of communication between the Attorney General and the Minister.<\/p><p>Are we still expected to believe that the Garda recording scandal was not central to the decision of the Garda Commissioner to resign?  The questions are multiplying and neither the Minister, Deputy Shatter, nor the Taoiseach has done anything to address them properly.  Their contributions raise far more questions than they answer.  <\/p><p> We are told that reform of the Garda will now accelerate.  I hope and trust that it will.  We are told that the latest scandal will be fully investigated and I hope it will be, but we must also have full accountability and full information from the Minister for Justice and Equality and from the Government.  The Minister and the Government have failed to provide that accountability and information.  With respect, I believe the Minister should indeed leave office.  The Attorney General must also account fully for her actions, or lack of them, in all of this as the case may be.  Are we now going to have a situation where the Labour Party in government is calling for the resignation of the Fine Gael Minister for Justice and Equality and as a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>the Fine Gael Party in government is threatening to call in turn for the resignation of the Attorney General, a Labour nominee?  <\/p><p> Instead of looking after number one, each of these parties should consider the great damage their prevarication has caused.  There can be no more riding this out.  It is long past time that the cold light of day was faced and that this coalition removed Deputy Shatter from ministerial office and if the suspected failures of her office are confirmed, the Attorney General should follow fast on his heels.  In his statement this afternoon the Minister, Deputy Shatter, said: &quot;I hope that my correcting the record of the D&aacute;il today will put this matter to rest&quot; - well he might so hope.  <\/p><p> This minimalist apology would have had more credibility if it had expressed the hope that his correcting the record would have gone some way towards addressing the great hurt and harm intentionally done to Garda Sergeant McCabe and to the former garda, John Wilson.  For the Minister, Deputy Shatter, it is all about getting beyond this mess, primarily of his own making, and at the least cost to himself.  <\/p><p> Sadly, there is little in this latest address by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to this House that comes anywhere close to a real statement of contrition.  Let the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste note well that the Minister's attempts to ride this out further will cost their parties dearly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600060#HHH00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395860400,"counter":733,"content":"<p>We will proceed to questions following the statements.

One hour is allowed for questions.  As there are only two Deputies present so far, I will not be rigid in the time allocation.  I call Deputy Niall Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600061#JJJ00200","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1395860400,"counter":734,"content":"<p>I will confine my questions to the issue of the Garda Inspectorate and the report.  I flagged two issues when I spoke earlier.  First, there was what we would describe as the premature leaking of the report.  Can the Minister give us an undertaking that the next time important reports are due -  important reports such as the Cooke and the Guerin reports are due and they will be discussed - that they will not be leaked to the media and that the Members of the Oireachtas will rightfully have first view of those?<\/p><p>  Second, I asked the Minister in my initial contribution about Mr. Robert Olsen of the Garda Inspectorate in the context of it having been detailed in a newspaper interview that he had never met the Minister and that they - or at least the Department of Justice and Equality - shared the same building.  Could the Minister comment on that?  <\/p><p>  Third, on the vacant position of Commissioner, the Minister has appointed Noreen O'Sullivan to act in an interim capacity and the Minister said that the position will be filled by open competition.  On the consequential back-fill vacancies that will occur, the recently departed Commissioner conducted a round of interviews to fill deputy commissioner posts and an assistant commissioner post.  Now that former Commissioner Callinan has departed the scene will interviews take place again?  In other words, will the process that had taken place under the stewardship of Commissioner Callinan be declared null and void and will the process start again once a new Commissioner has been appointed, or will those vacancies of deputy and assistant commissioners be filled by open competition also, or by what process will they be filled?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600061#JJJ00300","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1395860400,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I will take the Deputy's questions in the order he raised them.  I can absolutely assure him that I did not leak the inspectorate's report.  A query came into the Department of Justice and Equality from a well known journalist who clearly had substantial knowledge of what was in it.  I was asked would I do an interview and I explained I could not do an interview on the substance of the detail of the report because the following day it was being brought to Cabinet and then it was to be laid before the House and I agreed simply to make some general comments.  I give the Deputy my absolute assurance that I did not leak it and the individual who was responsible for the report would know I did not leak it.  As to where it came form, I cannot answer that.  We all know in political life that stuff emerges and it is a mystery, on occasions, how it does.  I did not leak it; I had no intention of leaking it.  It was my intention to bring the matter into Cabinet, brief colleagues on it and do what we ultimately did, which was later that day to lay it before both Houses.  That is basically what happened in relation to that issue.<\/p><p>  In relation to the Garda Inspectorate, one of the issues that arises is that the Garda Inspectorate is independent.  I have met with GSOC which is also independent in the circumstances of seeking to resolve issues of difficulty that arose between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the context of the Garda Inspectorate, there have been some very important issues with which it has been dealing, and it is important it deals with them independently, including the fixed ticket charge issue.  It is correct to say that I have not personally met Mr. Olsen.  I am looking forward and hoping to do that at a time when I will not be open to a charge in this House that if I had met him I was in some way trying to impact on his independence or subvert him.  I am conscious of the brouhaha that arose when I asked - not demanded or insisted - the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to brief me on the other issue and it requested to brief me because matters had appeared in the newspapers and if I had not had a briefing the next thing is that I would have been criticised in this House for knowing nothing about the issue.  I have not personally met him.  I know that in relation to the issues where he sought information, it had been furnished to him by departmental officials in my Department.  It is not out of any disrespect for him that I have not met him.  It is out of respect for the independence of the inspectorate and some issues it is dealing with.  I am very conscious at this moment that it is about to embark on the review that is to take place similar to the Haddington Road agreement.  The last thing I want is any of the Garda associations being of the view that I am trying to influence unfairly the outcome of that.  I hope the Deputy understands there are issues there of relevance.  <\/p><p>  On the final issue the Deputy raised, there was a TLAC-style competition with regard to the vacant posts he mentioned in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The outgoing Commissioner was one member of the group.  The outgoing Commissioner has given great service to this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600061#JJJ00400","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1395860400,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I must ask the Minister to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600061#JJJ00500","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1395860400,"counter":737,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked me three questions and the Acting Chairman said she would give some leeway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600061#JJJ00600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1395860400,"counter":738,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600061#JJJ00700","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1395860400,"counter":739,"content":"<p>They completed that process and there is an appointment to be made.<\/p><p>I hope it will be made relatively shortly.

There were allegations of which I was aware.  I had no means of establishing their veracity and raised appropriate questions in the House.  Eventually the Morris tribunal was established.  I was the Fine Gael justice spokesperson at the time.  My former colleague in this House, Mr. Jim Higgins, MEP, was the justice spokesperson immediately preceding me.  He did a lot of work on the issue, as did Deputy Brendan Howlin, now a Minister.  When Mr. Higgins took up another position, I was justice spokesperson.  I proposed motions in the House which ultimately led to the Morris tribunal.<\/p><p>  I had no information to suggest that what has now been revealed was taking place in Garda stations.  I was simply told there was an issue in County Donegal and I raised questions.  All of us in the House are familiar with the Morris tribunal which sat for a very long time and produced a report.  It is some considerable time since I read the report, but I have no recollection of any finding that there was a taping operation going on in Garda stations throughout the country.  If there had been, we would have all known about it a long time ago.  When I was appointed, I did not ask the Garda Commissioner whether there was a telephone system in Garda stations to tape telephone calls.  It would not have occurred to me that such a system was operating.  I again reiterate that the first I knew of it was in the briefing I received in the Department - a detailed briefing by officials - on Monday evening.  Towards the end of the briefing the Taoiseach contacted me and I joined him and the Attorney General for a conversation.<\/p><p>  I was not present on Sunday, but I understand the Taoiseach and the Attorney General who work extraordinarily hard and extremely long hours were working in their Departments.  I may be wrong, but it is my understanding they were both working.  It may have been the case that the Attorney General was working at home; as I have not asked this question, I do not want to give a version of which I cannot be sure for fear of someone accusing me of misleading the House.  My understanding is a conversation took place in the context of a set of civil proceedings which I referenced earlier but into which I cannot go because of the fact that matters are pending before the courts.  The Attorney General briefed the Taoiseach about her concerns.<\/p><p>  The Attorney General is extraordinarily hard-working and for fear of some new myth developing, she and I speak to each other regularly about new legislation being drafted.  As it happens, this was not an issue with which I was personally familiar.  Of course, I knew proceedings were taking place, but as Minister, I am not involved in the day-to-day engagement in these proceedings.  They are dealt with through the Chief State's Solicitors office and the Office of the Attorney General and counsel who are appointed to deal with these matters.<\/p><p>  As I said previously, there is no more mystery about this.  As I understand it, both the Attorney General, having assessed the full background as information became available to her, and the Taoiseach took the matter very seriously.  I took it very seriously.  During the course of this evening Deputies have raised some of the issues of concern.  There are all sorts of possible implications, which is why a decision was made to have an independent commission of inquiry to address the matter.  I cannot put it any further than this.  It would be unfortunate-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600062#KKK00600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1395861000,"counter":746,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600062#KKK00700","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1395861000,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I wish to say this as it is very important.

It might be worth the Minister's while to refer to the UCD Sutherland School of Law, where two barristers have stated that in this context, they respectfully request that consideration be given to including the case of Shane O'Farrell in the files to be examined by Mr. Guerin.  That letter was sent to the Taoiseach on 28 February.  Consequently, it is clear there is a case to be answered in this regard.  The point I was making in respect of Shane Farrell and his mother, Lucia O'Farrell, is that there are such questions on the investigation, how the case was handled and what happened afterwards from a number of different Government agencies that would inform the Minister as to the weaknesses in all this.<\/p><p>  The other issue to which I referred and about which the Minister asked me to revert to him was that of the profiling of Travellers on the PULSE system.  Because this is such a serious matter which infringes the human rights of individuals and families and is extensive, I asked that the Minister arrange for an investigation or even talk to Sergeant Maurice McCabe, who obviously is in possession of the material pertaining to this matter, and ask him what he considers to be the issue.  The Minister should do so to inform himself in order that he knows what he is dealing with when he is speaking to the Garda or whoever will investigate this matter.  Finally, I referred the Minister to the loss by a family of a daughter and a granddaughter and the fact that in the course of the investigation, GSOC has failed to date to get appointments with the investigating garda&iacute; in a Cork Garda station.  I find that to be absolutely incredible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600063#LLL00600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1395861600,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I will take these matters in reverse order.  First, the Deputy has raised a case regarding a matter in Cork of which I am not aware.  Everyone in this House who has an interest in these issues is familiar with the report that was produced by GSOC arising out of the Boylan case, in which it made a complaint about the length of time it took to get some information and documentation from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I had previously told the House in respect of this matter that while substantial documentation was furnished over an extended period of time, it was quite clear that this was an issue of great concern to GSOC, and arising out of that - I revert to a conversation Deputy Collins and I had a few minutes ago - I took with great seriousness the concerns expressed by GSOC.  We organised in my Department a meeting with the then Garda Commissioner and the head of GSOC to discuss the difficulties that had arisen.  For some time - I am now talking about last summer - there had been ongoing discussions involving GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the creation of a new protocol to ensure issues of difficulty were dealt with between them and that there were strict timelines for dealing with issues, with some matters addressed where unexpected difficulties could arise.  Those protocols had not been completed and as the talks in my view had gone on for an unduly lengthy period, I urged them to bring matters to a conclusion.  Ultimately, the protocols were completed and agreed and were signed in September of 2013.  As part of the arrangement that was to be put in place to prevent the type of situation that the Deputy describes from arising, it was arranged that if GSOC encountered difficulties such as an inability to access materials for an inordinate length of time, or protocols not being complied with, an official in my Department would be informed.  If need be, the official in question would resolve the matter with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or sit down with the heads of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC and mediate a solution, because one cannot have such issues dragging on.  Consequently, if there is a difficulty, we have a mechanism to deal with it, and I urge that it be dealt with.  The Deputy can communicate to the person concerned that if it is believed that GSOC is having this difficulty, it should invoke this mechanism and it should be resolved.<\/p><p>  As for the other few issues raised, I am conscious of time, but the Deputy raised the issue of a letter I sent to him.  I appreciate that he now has come back with what might be described as a modified presentation from that made earlier, because he previously berated me about this matter on the basis that he had told me about it and I had told him there were procedures in place that should be followed.  The Deputy raised a serious issue in this House in an earlier debate.  I had concerns about it and met him just outside the confines of the Chamber.  I explained to him that I did not know the detail of the matter.  I explained to him that if he wrote to me detailing the circumstances of the individual, I would have the matter looked into.  Out of concern, I wrote to him a short number of days thereafter stating:<blockquote>Dear John,<br \/><br \/>Earlier this week you raised the issue of a female member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who took a complaint of sexual harassment to the confidential recipient.  I am not aware of any details of what is alleged to have occurred, other then what you said in the D&aacute;il and what has been reported in the media.  Any such allegations of the type described are, of course, operational matters that would fall to be dealt with under the procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for dealing with complaints of this nature.  However, if you forward the details of the case to me, I will arrange to have the matter followed up and will revert to you in due course.<\/blockquote>I am still waiting for the Deputy to do that, so obviously he was mistaken earlier on what he said.  There are of course internal Garda procedures to deal with issues of sexual harassment.  However, if there is an issue of this nature and it is not followed up properly, I have no difficulty with the details being given to me and I will ensure it is followed up in a manner that is appropriate and does not prejudice any issues.  However, I again state to the Deputy that it obviously is for the individual concerned to determine to what extent the individual wishes information to be furnished to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I totally understand that.  However, if the information becomes available, the Deputy is very welcome to furnish it to me and I assure him that I will follow it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600063#LLL00700","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1395861600,"counter":758,"content":"<p>To put it on the record, the lady in question did go through the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600063#LLL01000","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1395861600,"counter":759,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600063#LLL01100","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1395861600,"counter":760,"content":"<p>However, as she still awaits an outcome, the Minister can understand the reason she may not have the confidence in the process that one should have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600063#LLL01200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1395861600,"counter":761,"content":"<p>Sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600063#LLL01300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1395861600,"counter":762,"content":"<p>When I get the reply from her, I certainly will raise the matter directly with the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600063#LLL01400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1395861600,"counter":763,"content":"<p>Yes, but that is the exact reason I invited the Deputy to give me the details.

I think the Minister informed us this morning that he got a phone call from the Taoiseach and that the first he heard about this was at 6 p.m. on Sunday but that it took him until 12.20 p.m. on Monday to read the letter.  Surely the officials in the Department deal with the Minister.  The Minister questioned Deputy McGuinness about not getting a letter but what guarantee have we that the Minister gets letters sent to him when the Commissioner's letter took 15 days to be read, although not dealt with, by him and in spite of the fact senior officials, the Commissioner and the Attorney General were in meetings about the very same topic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600064#MMM00900","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1395862200,"counter":792,"content":"<p>I can only tell the Deputy what happened.  This letter apparently arrived in my Department on 10 March.  It arrived in the context of issues relating to the civil action that was taking place.  I understand there was some initial meeting on 10 March and a further meeting on 11 March.  I think the substantial focus on the part of officials in the Department was on the proceedings, which I cannot go into in any detail.  Clearly, the letter had information that was of importance.  I can only say to the Deputy that it was not furnished to me.  I can say to him that an enormous volume of correspondence of a very important nature comes into the Department of Justice and Equality on a daily basis.  This would not be the only important piece of correspondence that would be received.  Both during the day and going home in the evening, I would normally take a substantial amount of papers and correspondence with me.<\/p><p>  In the context of the events of that week, I do not have my diary in front of me but my recollection is that Deputy Niall Collins, Deputy Mac Lochlainn and I follow each other around with some regularity and we would have spent all of the Wednesday morning on the DNA database legislation.  From what I remember, I think that week - I am open to correction - the Cabinet meeting was on a Wednesday and not a Tuesday.  That would have occupied my full day that day.  On the Friday, I was in the Department of Defence.  On the Thursday, the Secretary General of my Department was at the Committee of Public Accounts and I think he spent some considerable time, because the committee was dealing with other matters, waiting to deal with matters at the committee.  As events fell, the letter was not furnished to me.<\/p><p>  I went to Mexico for the St. Patrick's Day ministerial arrangements and did a series of things in Mexico through the Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  I was not back in Dublin until the Friday.  The reality is, and the way matters worked out, and as we know from my reply earlier today to, I think, Deputy Mac Lochlainn who raised it, the Taoiseach had a conversation on the Sunday evening with the Attorney General.  I was briefed on it on the Monday.  The letter was not furnished to me.  I was briefed on the matter but was not told of the letter.  I did not receive a letter but my officials, in fairness to them, gave me a sufficiently detailed briefing for me to engage with the Taoiseach and the Attorney General on the issue.

I assume the Minister thinks these are really serious issues.  In all of his answers, the Minister has said he was not told about these serious issues.  The Taoiseach briefed myself and the Fianna F&aacute;il leader and told us that he phoned the Attorney General about an unrelated matter on Sunday evening and the Attorney General told him, when they had dealt with that issue, that she had a very serious issue she needed to discuss with him.

These are serious matters and when I became aware of the extent of this matter, I took it with great seriousness, as did the Taoiseach and the Attorney General.  In the context of the working group, this, as I understand it, was an internal Garda working group and there was a representative of the Attorney General's office, I am advised, on it.  There was no one from my Department on it.  What was happening within this group was that it was seeking to ascertain the extent of the problem and how many tapes there were.  I cannot give the Deputy a specific answer as to at what point it was established how many tapes there were.  My understanding of what happened, which reflects exactly what the Taoiseach said earlier, was that there was a substantial number of tapes found and that there was a change in the system in 2008 which changed, in some way, the technology.  I am still not clear on how many recordings exist and I cannot definitively say from which Garda stations.<\/p><p>   This is why we want the matter inquired into.  I know that the interim Commissioner is having this matter examined in great detail and I expect she will report to my Department on the matter.

It is a very detailed report which seems to have been sent to the former Minister, Dermot Ahern, on 30 April 2009, accompanied by a letter from the commissioners Mr. Conor Brady and Ms Carmel Foley of GSOC.

The letter goes on to say that the examination report has now been completed and that the report, with recommendations, &quot;is presented herewith&quot;.  The letter points out that the commission would have hoped that this exercise could have been completed by an earlier date but that due to an initial backlog of complaints and an onerous caseload, priority in resourcing allocation had to be accorded to operational matters.

Can I take it from this that there was no legislative underpinning of these recordings up to 2007?  Can I take it also that there is at least a likelihood and possibility that these recordings were illegal and in breach of the law and that offences could have been committed?  Is this an issue the Minister wishes to pursue?  Does he want to pursue the issue that whoever sanctioned these recordings had no legislative underpinning and could have been in breach of legislation?<\/p><p>  The second issue I wish to ask about concerns the Attorney General.  The Minister provided the D&aacute;il with information that the Attorney General was made aware on 11 November 2003 of the existence of the tapes and of the possible existence of other tapes.  He then went on to say that she had no knowledge at the time of the circumstances surrounding the making of the tapes, the background to their being made, the content or the number of tapes.  The Minister has told us what she did not know, but what did she know?  Did the Garda Commissioner phone her and say they had found some tapes - perhaps they could have been recordings of the latest documentary - and did she not ask what they were about?  I am sure she knew they were tapes of conversations within Garda stations.  She must at least have had that basic information.  If not, when did she get the basic information on them?<\/p><p>  Is the Minister alarmed, with the passage of a number of months, that this information was not brought to his attention?  When this information was brought to the attention of the Taoiseach, it resulted in a commission of inquiry.  Unfortunately, we see in the courts today that it has resulted in an impact on trials that are due to take place.  Therefore, is the Minister concerned that the legal adviser to the State did not bring this to his attention when she found out the seriousness of the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600067#PPP00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1395864000,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I cannot speak on behalf of the Attorney General in respect of details I do not know.  My understanding is that on her side, this particular issue arose in regard to a piece of litigation involving two different people that was taking place and that tapes were disclosed or found that could be of relevance - and proved ultimately to be of relevance - to this litigation.  This is my understanding of the November issue.  I understand the focus was on this piece of litigation.  I do not know the timeline as established by the working group the Garda Commissioner set up, but clearly the Attorney General became very concerned and alarmed and I presume at some point the scale of the issue became clear.  However, I do not think it was clear in November.  When it became clear, she, appropriately, briefed the Taoiseach and that is the position.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned some trials today may have been affected by this.  It is not a national secret that I spent most of my day in the Chamber, so I am not familiar at the moment with events that happened in the courts today.  Obviously, the implications of this are serious and that is the reason the issue is being taken seriously.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about the 2007 legislation I referred to earlier.  As I understand it, that is legislation which ensured the legality of recording a 999 call.  A tape can be made of such conversations automatically.  There is legislation regarding taping, such as telecommunications legislation.  For brevity, there was a 1983 Act and a 1993 Act.  The 1983 Act seemed to require that if a conversation was taped in these sorts of circumstances, the taping required the consent of both parties to the conversation.  The 1993 Act seemed to change the law to require only the consent of one of the parties to the conversation.  However, I do not pretend to be an expert on this aspect of the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600067#PPP00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1395864000,"counter":850,"content":"<p>Is an offence committed if there is no consent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600067#PPP00400","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1395864000,"counter":851,"content":"<p>Clearly, the legal implications of all of this are a matter to be considered by the statutory commission of inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600067#PPP00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1395864000,"counter":852,"content":"<p>Before Deputy Ross contributes, I ask him to be conscious that Deputies Buttimer and Boyd Barrett have yet to put their questions and we have just eight minutes for the three of them and the Minister must reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600067#PPP00600","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1395864000,"counter":853,"content":"<p>I have just two questions for the Minister.

The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, addressed the House this evening on the fixed charge processing system in terms of a 21st century strategy which was brought to Cabinet on 12 March.  As the Minister knows, one of the recommendations was that a criminal justice working group be created by the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Justice and Equality.  Is it intended that this group will report to the Cabinet or to the Houses of the Oireachtas so that we can have an insight into that?

There were 396 fatalities on our roads in 2005 and this had been reduced to 162 in 2012.  As I said earlier, even a single fatality is one fatality too much, but it is a very dramatic reduction.  Unfortunately, last year the numbers increased to 190 but it is still a far better position than in 2005 and fortuitously, so far, as we come to the end of the first quarter of this year, I am advised that fatalities are somewhat down on last year.  I hope that continues to be the case.<\/p><p>  It is important to put this in context.  In all the criticism of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that has been voiced, both the rank and file and management have taken very substantive action to try to ensure that our roads are safer and that people drive safely.  In my initial statement to the House I detailed the extent of Garda activity and engagement in that context.  I will not repeat it because we are time constrained.  Saving lives on our roads is not simply about Garda engagement but is about people being compliant.  The GSOC report of 2009 detailed the importance of compliance in reducing traffic accidents.  If we were to judge the system of fixed charge notices against such criteria provided, clearly it has been successful.  Both the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar and I would like to see the figures decrease further.<\/p><p>  The recommendations made for administering this system are of great importance.  I have set the timelines and the action plan has been published.  The working group will report to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar and me.  From time to time we will report to our Government colleagues on progress being made.  I have no difficulty with our occasionally reporting to the House.  So far this working group has met twice, so, clearly, it needs some time to complete the work is doing.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Ross's question, as I said previously, I was present with the Taoiseach and the Attorney General at the meeting that took place in the Taoiseach's Department on Monday evening.

They do not appear in fatality statistics but their lives and those of families are forever affected by serious traffic accidents.  We have at least that one united objective of trying to ensure we make our roads a good deal safer than they are.  It is not just a matter of Garda enforcement; it takes in the public's attitude and the need for people to behave responsibly.  It also encompasses the safety of our road system and the need for people to obey traffic lights, as well as the behaviour of pedestrians.  It is alarming that there appears to be an increase in pedestrian fatalities.  From reading some of what was said at the conference held by the Road Safety Authority last week, I was not absolutely clear whether some of the pedestrian deaths had arisen from pedestrian behaviour, driver behaviour or a mixture of both.  Probably all of us in this House have been guilty of the behaviour that is emerging internationally of driver distraction, which I referenced very briefly.  On occasion we have all driven cars while speaking on telephones, and one of the enforcement issues for garda&iacute; which can result in action is when somebody is holding a mobile phone - or cellphone in the United States - and speaking while driving.  Most cars are now fitted with equipment to enable people to engage in conversation without holding a mobile phone, and there is a growing concern that the extent to which people are distracted by phone calls results in serious accidents.  The perception some years ago was that once a person was not holding a phone, he or she would be relatively safe.  One can understand how that may not be the case, as an individual may be particularly engaged in a conversation, irate or stressed on the telephone, which could have fatal consequences either for a driver or others.  We must give some further thought and consideration to the area, although it goes beyond any issue in the inspectorate report.  It is a concern in the road safety sphere and I am sure my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, is giving serious thought to it in tandem with the Road Safety Authority.<\/p><p>  There is also the question of communicating with young people.  Far too many road fatalities are young men, either teenagers or in their early 20s, and much of the advertising and communication about the danger of driving at excessive speed bypasses too many young people, unfortunately.  As a result, too many die on our roads.<\/p><p>  It has been a long day and I appreciate the contributions made by Members.  I will not say I was enthralled by the repetitive calls for my resignation, which seemed to form part of a single transferable speech that some Members deliver.

As Irish republicans we campaign for one service in a united Ireland, but between now and then we will continue to campaign for reforms of policing services on this island.  A key campaigning point is restorative justice, as justice must be about restoration and not just retribution.  Tackling crime, particularly petty crime, cannot simply be left to the Garda, as it cannot tackle this crime on its own.  Garda&iacute; would be the first to admit this.  It must be about a partnership approach, with garda&iacute;, local authorities, and community and political representatives working together to improve the quality of life of those suffering from crime.<\/p><p>  Whole communities have felt abandoned by the Garda and the powers-that-be.  Many residents in these communities feel they are being held to ransom by those involved in serious anti-social behaviour but the powers-that-be are unable or unwilling to tackle the problem.  This is unacceptable and a new approach must be taken.  People have a right to live, work and play in safety in their community, and if a crime is committed, they can expect it to be dealt with through due process and justice restored.<\/p><p>  This Bill is a step in the right direction and Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting it, despite our serious concerns about certain aspects, and we intend to amend it accordingly.  In an all-Ireland justice system we see restorative justice as being one of the cornerstones.  Restorative justice approaches contrast with the traditional punitive or retributive approaches of the current justice system.  Restorative justice involves victims and communities directly and ensures that the offender actually confronts his or her behaviour and its causes, taking steps to make up for the harm done.  It is an inclusive approach.<\/p><p>  This restorative approach leads to much higher levels of victim satisfaction with the process.  This is principally because restorative justice, wherever possible, involves all those who have a stake in a specific offence.  It aims to collectively identify and address the resulting emotional, physical and financial harm, as well as the associated needs and obligations of all involved, in order to offer the victims more direct redress.  Restorative justice actively connects the offender with victim in a safe and controlled context called victim-offender conferencing in order to enable them to create healing.  Restorative justice therefore contrasts with traditional punitive or retributive justice.  The victim is viewed as central to the process, and it is not about guilt and punishment but about rebuilding and repairing.  Typically, restorative justice methods bring victims and offenders together in a safe and structured way, in the presence of a trained mediator, to decide on the most appropriate response to the harm caused by the offence, with the victim playing a major role in the process and often receiving some form of restitution or reparation from the offender.  In order for the process to succeed, participation must be voluntary on the part of both victim and offender, and the offender must concede the basic facts of the offence and responsibility for the crime.  With consent, family members and the broader community may also be included where appropriate.<\/p><p>  Restorative justice was born out of the conflict on this island.  In the Six Counties, communities had to look at alternatives to mainstream policing.<\/p><p>This was simply because the then RUC was unacceptable to the Nationalist community.  It has since become the norm in many communities across the North, particularly in Belfast and Derry.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the fact that restorative justice is being seen as part of the solution in this State.  I know it has been piloted in some communities but much more needs to be done to resource and support it.  It must become a central tool of justice and policing.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in sees an increasingly important role for restorative justice in the justice system of a future united Ireland, as we believe that in a great many cases it is more socially effective than retributive justice, as it results in higher victim satisfaction, lower instances of repeat offending, and greater chances of offender rehabilitation and reintegration into the community.<\/p><p> This Bill has limitations, particularly where it calls for attachment orders to be imposed.  This could well punish innocent family members.  Partners and children should not be punished for the crimes of others but this can all be debated on Committee Stage and we are happy to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600069#RRR00900","speaker":"981","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395865800,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy Halligan on publishing this Bill and welcome the discussion on restorative justice last night and tonight.

That would give Government and Opposition Members an opportunity to put down amendments that would strengthen the Bill.  Restorative justice is recognised in 100 countries.  There are various models of restorative justice.  In Canada there are 12 distinct models.  It is not appropriate in all cases, for instance, cases of domestic violence, murder or aggravated burglary.  It has advantages, some of which Deputy McLellan outlined.  It does not always involve the repatriation of damages, as set out in Deputy Halligan&rsquo;s Bill by way of attachment orders.  I have some concerns about that.  Deputy McLellan touched on them.  There is a danger that, where an attachment order is put in place as part of a restorative justice model or process, those who have no connection with a crime, a spouse or children, for example, somebody on a low income or social welfare, could be penalised too.  That would go against the spirit of restorative justice. <\/p><p>  Restorative justice has benefits for the victim, offender and the wider community and we should consider it.  The Department of Justice and Equality is considering publishing its own Bill.  The Minister of State might confirm that when she wraps up the debate tonight.  In his responses to some parliamentary questions I have tabled on restorative justice, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is open to developing it. <\/p><p>  Community restorative justice offers great benefits.  It can be achieved through statutory organisations or community groups.  In some countries it is even used within schools.  People grow up with the principles and values of a restorative justice process and transfer it from school to adult or criminal settings.  There is a great deal of research on those countries.<\/p><p>  In other countries, such as Brazil, restorative justice programmes are aimed at adults.  All of these points can be debated on Committee Stage and we will support the Bill&rsquo;s passage to that Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600070#SSS00200","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1395865800,"counter":883,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Private Member's Bill on restorative justice and the issues involved.  Crime has a heavy impact on victims and we must always remember the profound effect that it can have across all aspects of a victim's life.  Whether the victim is a person, a homeowner or a business there can be financial consequences to crime and all victims will suffer some kind of emotional impact.  In discussing crime and justice we must always remember the rights of victims.<\/p><p>  When we are dealing with our approach to crime we must also think about those who commit it, we must ensure that our justice system provides opportunities for people to put right wrongs that they may have committed.  Giving people an opportunity to avoid criminal records, to avoid prison, can provide opportunities to reduce crime rates and, at an early stage, turn people away from criminal activities.  We must all strive to ensure that happens.  In giving people an opportunity to change their ways we must ensure there are still consequences and that we do not allow people to reoffend multiple times before the justice system kicks in.  People must understand that their actions have consequences.  I thank Deputy Halligan for proposing this Bill and for making proposals on restorative justice.<\/p><p>  In his fine speech Deputy O'Brien spoke about restorative justice but what does it really mean?  It ensures that victims, offenders and the community work together in response to crime to prevent it recurring.  It is not a question of condoning harmful behaviour but it is aimed at communities and supporting individuals, while holding them to account for their actions.  The concept of restorative justice is wider than making monetary payments for losses which arise from criminal events.  It is intended to meet the needs of victims and encourage offenders to take responsibility for their actions.  The concept should underpin our approach to crime prevention, our approach to investigations and prosecutions and must be the underlying rationale of any punishment administered by the courts.<\/p><p>  Last Saturday afternoon in Cork city, where the Minister of State and I live, on one of the city's busiest streets, there was a dreadful assault which occurred in broad daylight: two young people attacked a homeless person.  Thankfully garda&iacute; were quickly on the scene; the victim, I am pleased to say, will hopefully make a full recovery, and there have been two arrests.<\/p><p>  Incidents like the one last Saturday get much media attention but we must consider the overall rates of crime rather than just one or two high profile incidents.  Winthrop Street is one of the busiest streets in Cork and each afternoon and weekend many teenagers hang out in the vicinity of the fast food outlets and shops there.  While some people may feel somewhat intimidated by large groups, most of the time there are no unsavoury incidents and we must acknowledge the excellent behaviour of the vast majority of teenagers.<\/p><p>  Last Saturday's incident, however, highlights the need to provide alternative places for young people to gather. <\/p><p>There should be engagement between Cork City Council and young people across the city on providing facilities where young people can gather away from busy streets.  Garda&iacute; in Cork are proactive in how they deal with crime, responding to community needs and redeploying resources as required.  Over a three year period from 2011 to 2013 there have been 170 incidents on Winthrop Street, an average of just over one incident per week.  So far this year there have nine incidents on Winthrop Street, two thirds of which occurred at night.  This is in keeping with trends of the last three years which consistently show that most incidents occur on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.  I use these figures to reassure people that during the day, and even at night, the streets of Cork are safe and that high profile incidents are a rare exception.  At last week's meeting of the Anglesea Street local policing district forum management committee, garda&iacute; presented up to date crime figures which indicated that thefts, assaults and public order offences were down in Cork city centre.  This downward trend is welcome and must be attributed to the excellent work of the garda&iacute; in Cork city.  The progressive community policing by garda&iacute; in Cork helps create a sense of community and responsibility.  I hope this will continue.<\/p><p> All crimes have victims and all crimes instil fear beyond their direct victims.  By ensuring that the concept of restorative justice underpins all aspects of the criminal justice system we can deliver a process that respects and prioritises the rights of victims, creates a sense of community and offers those who have committed minor offences an opportunity to change their ways and make amends for their wrongs.  I look forward to the Minister's proposals on the Community Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill, which will provide for a proper system of victim compensation and a system of restorative justice for minor offences at District Court level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600070#SSS00300","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395866400,"counter":885,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Halligan on introducing this Bill.  I listened carefully to his contribution yesterday evening and I hope all Members share his concern for highlighting the belief among the general public that victims are left out of the picture when severe incidents occur.  All of us can participate in strengthening the legislation in that regard.  There is some justification for the public's belief that the law as it stands does not fully protect victims of assault and other crimes.  It is up to us to strengthen the law in the interest of victims.<\/p><p>  The impacts of assaults on people are varied, as has been outlined yesterday evening.  I am aware of one incident that occurred three months ago when an individual who happened to be travelling on a bus was physically assaulted to a limited degree after being caught in a brawl that had nothing to do with him.  However, his biggest problem was the mental rather than the physical effects of the assault.  It is a terrifying experience for a law abiding citizen to be trapped on a bus in the midst of a brawl.  The individual has not taken the bus since his experience and has been attending counselling sessions at his own expense.  As he does not come from a well heeled part of the city, this is a huge financial burden for him.  We should take these aspects of crime into consideration in improving the law.  The Criminal Justice Act 1993 provides powers for courts to compensate victims.  I agree with speakers who suggested last night that the legislation could be strengthened in that regard.<\/p><p>  In regard to the Bill before us, I have strong reservations about sections 13 and 14, which provide for Garda assessments of the cost of retribution to victims.  I do not think that is a function which should be given to the Garda.  I understand a similar measure was attempted in the United States but it was not successful.  There may be a way around the problems but I have reservations about giving that responsibility to the Garda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600071#TTT00200","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speech","time":1395866400,"counter":886,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Restorative Justice (Reparation of Victims) Bill 2013.  I recognise that Deputy Halligan has introduced the Bill in a sincere attempt to deal the perpetrators of certain crimes by keeping them out of our prison system.  Particularly in the case of juvenile crime, I think we can all agree that is a direction we need to follow.  Restorative justice as an alternative to the prison system should become part of the justice process.  There are those who might say that it is trivialising crime but incarceration is too severe a penalty for certain crimes.  Far from trivialising crime, restorative justice is a genuine attempt to prevent recidivism while keeping victims and their families at the heart of the process.  Of course, it should not proceed unless the victim's consent has been obtained.<\/p><p>  This is part of a new policy direction which looks at crime differently by focusing on the needs of victims, offenders and communities instead of simply punishing the offender.  Doing time does not necessarily work and it certainly is not the best way for offenders to take responsibility for their actions.  It is often far better for the victim to obtain an apology and be recompensed for his or her loss or require the offender to perform community service.  In some countries fostering dialogue between the victim and offender has proven to be the most satisfactory for the victim in that the offender must account for his or her actions and the victim can in turn explain the pain and suffering that the crime caused.<\/p><p>  Aspects of the Bill before us should be considered carefully and I ask the Department of Justice and Equality, which is currently examining the EU victims' directive with a view to bringing forward legislation to deal with victim's rights, to consider Deputy Halligan's proposals.  It is imperative that victims of crime receive appropriate information, advise and protection.  The Criminal Justice ( Community Sanctions) Bill will replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907, which deals with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service.  The heads of that Bill are being considered by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence in the context of its pre-legislative scrutiny role.  I ask Deputy Halligan to make a submission to the joint committee on the Bill.  The committee recently completed hearings on the potential that a community court service might offer.  It was most interesting to learn about the approaches taken in other countries, most notably including New York, where it has proven a great success. <\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy Shatter, sat in on the consultation with stakeholders which outlined his commitment to addressing and considering this in great detail.  At that meeting he committed to establishing a pilot scheme which would be specifically tailored for the city of Dublin.  I welcome that interesting direction in which we should be going.  It is something that will benefit everybody.  Even if one looks at the economics of the situation, it will benefit us in that regard as well.<\/p><p> I also want at this point to acknowledge the excellent work being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its efforts to reduce crime to protect us all, in particular, the work of the community liaison garda&iacute; who work so diligently within the communities.  Therefore, it is with regret I would have to say that while there are aspects of this Bill that contain good ideas there are other aspects of it which have been widely outlined by previous speakers.  I will not go into them now.  As I stated earlier, I would urge the Department to consider the proposals within the Bill when it is looking at the EU victim's directive and that Deputy Halligan would make a submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it is considering the pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600071#TTT00300","speaker":"1099","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395867000,"counter":888,"content":"<p>I also welcome the opportunity to speak to this matter and I thank Deputy Halligan for bringing this issue before the House for debate.<\/p><p>  It is, as my colleague, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, stated, part of a modern justice system that we consider restorative justice.  When we look at the criminal justice system the challenge is to decide on what is the correct reprimand or penalty that somebody convicted of a criminal offence should receive.  A good rule of thumb in this regard is to consider how one would feel if something was taken from one's pocket.  I refer, in this case, to compensation.  It is apt that we should consider that where at all possible whoever is a perpetrator, be it in the form of harm to a person or property, should also pay from his or her pocket and, depending on the severity of the crime, the appropriate other sanction might also be a prison sentence.<\/p><p>  There have been issues and difficulties identified with the Bill but I hope that Deputy Halligan can take some comfort from the forthcoming criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill that has been approved by the Government for drafting and will deal with all kinds of issues pertaining to the Probation of Offenders Act 1907, including community sanctions and so on.  In particular, what is welcome is a specific item that deals with restorative justice that would operate within the District Court, where, ordinarily, lessor offences are tried and where such compensation could be made by an offender with the agreement of the victim which in turn would in some way allow for a discharge order or a binding-over order.  As has been stated, this would suit a one-off type offence or a young offender, or give somebody a second chance, which is fair enough to expect from a criminal justice system.<\/p><p>  When we look at the way the criminal justice system operates the other aspect is reparation for society.  I have particular issues that I have raised previously in this House which relate to the criminal legal aid system.  I wholly subscribe to the idea that persons should have access to the law and to the courts.  This is an essential part of the rule of law in any democracy, and we must stand firm with that.  One is entitled to have effective legal representation in court.  However, there is the reality of a small few offending repeatedly.  Sometimes these are minor offences but the fact that there are repeated minor offences makes them become serious offences entitling the accused to legal aid because he or she faces a possible term of imprisonment.  In many cases, the accused are on social welfare.  They are getting legal aid.  I can speak personally on this because I operate in the system as a solicitor.  In many cases, those involved are not upholding their familial responsibilities.  They will have money for alcohol and for the betting offices.  Then they break up somebody's property, get involved in an altercation, injure somebody and are in court the next morning, once again.  I refer to repeat offenders who are getting legal aid.  For the ordinary citizen, this is galling and upsetting.<\/p><p>  This matter has been looked at by a task force which was seeking to reduce criminal legal aid costs and one of the issues cited in claiming payment from this type of offender would be the cost of administration, but it goes back to hitting people in the pocket.  They have money for other matters that I would not count as necessities.  They should, even in a nominal way, which is how we value matters in this society, face a charge.  There is, in parallel, the civil legal aid system where parties in crisis in their lives wait months to see a solicitor, whether in a family law case or a contract case such as having their house repossessed.  This is the reason many voluntary organisations have sprung up to advise citizens.  It is important we have this well-rounded debate on such offenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600072#UUU00200","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1395867000,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I will use my time to relate to a previous restorative justice Bill to see how it functioned.  I refer to the Children Act 2001, the debate on which I was involved, which was a restorative justice measure.  We have no idea how that Act operated because it related to the children's courts.  The expectations for it were high.  I will give some details of the restorative aspect of that Act.<\/p><p>  The Children Bill 1999 was a development of the family conference which was an integral part of the programme on family and children's difficulties.  That was greatly expanded to incorporate within its parameters modern restorative justice measures in the 1999 Bill in regard to children who had offended.  The primary focus of this conference is on issues of accountability rather than welfare.  Previously, the family conference was to do with the welfare of the child, but this incorporated a parameter of restorative justice measures as well.  The conference is convened by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to formulate an action plan for the child in respect of whom it is convened.  The action plan includes provision for many matters, including the making of an apology or financial or other reparation to the victim.  This also includes provision relating to the child's lifestyle such as his or her attendance at school or participation inappropriate sporting or recreational activities.<\/p><p>  In practical terms the range of possibilities to intervene in the child's behaviour was almost limitless, as long as it was agreed to by the persons present at the conference, which would include family.  The advantage of involving the child and his or her family in the decision making process and of being a party to the decision would increase the likelihood of compliance.<\/p><p>  Since this was introduced we are in the dark as to how it has operated.  The provision of some information to the House at some stage would give a significant insight into how something that provided such a level of hope for the family conference in dealing with child offenders has operated.<\/p><p>The victim of the child's offending could be invited to attend the conference.  If the victim attends, the child is confronted by the consequences of his or her criminal behaviour.  How did this operate in practice abroad?  The victims in the pilot programmes welcome the opportunity of being present at such a conference.  This was borne out in the pilot project studies.  Some victims stressed the value of expressing their feelings to the young offenders and ensuring the offender learned from the experience.  It was believed at the time that the victims would want to contribute to the offenders' rehabilitation in certain circumstances or to show their support for the process of rehabilitation of the child.  Other victims emphasise their own interests.  They may want to make sure things are done properly to get reparation.<\/p><p> Another innovation allows victims to be present at the administration of the formal caution by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is known as restorative cautioning and is a suitable type of mini-conference response in circumstances where a full conference is not warranted.  It means the child offender can be confronted with the consequences of his or her offending and can be invited to apologise or make some form of reparation to the victim in a low-key atmosphere.  It would be interesting to get a full report on how successful its operation was over the past decade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600072#UUU00300","speaker":"1056","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395867600,"counter":891,"content":"<p>I have long been a supporter of restorative justice programmes.  It makes perfect sense to me for our legal process to have restoration centred judicial remedies.  If a victim feels that he or she would benefit from an apology then, where possible, that should be facilitated.  If victims of theft want their goods returned or replaced by the thief, that too should be facilitated if it can be agreed.  If victims of assault have had non-compensated financial loss following an injury received and wish to accept voluntary compensation offered by the perpetrator, then that too should be facilitated but there are better ways of doing this than the proposals in the Bill.<\/p><p>  Restorative justice needs to be a two-way street.  Ideally, it should be restorative for the victim and also restorative for the perpetrator.  The victim would receive, in words or gesture, a contribution towards closure of a bad experience.  On the other side, restorative justice, if properly implemented, should reduce the chance of a criminal repeating the crime.  One problem with the Bill is that it does not look at both sides of the restorative justice equation.  Overall, the Bill is not positive for the victim or the criminal.  For example, there is nothing in this proposed legislation to protect the victim of a serious assault who does not want the assailant to pay his way into a softer sentence.  The courts have already heard from outraged rape victims criticising the decision of judges who, on their behalf but without their request, accepted compensation sums from the attacker in lieu of long prison sentences.  Nothing in the Bill distinguishes minor administrative crimes, for example not paying a parking fine, from serious crimes like rape and homicide.  If this law was enacted, it could be applied to a rapist as easily as to a petty thief.<\/p><p>  Compensation money and sentencing for serious crimes need to be addressed in law.  There is no benefit to society if rich rapists and terrorists can buy their way into softer sentences.  Equally, the compensation of any victim, even for a minor crime needs to occur within a structure that does not lead to an unhealthy concentration of false accusations for fraudulent purposes.  Money and sentencing are two issues that must be handled carefully and separately.<\/p><p>  I would welcome a law that facilitates an element of financial compensation to be paid by the guilty party but not in a manner that obstructs justice.  Some crimes need harsh sentences to act as a deterrent to others.  Some criminals need to be safely behind bars for as long as possible for the protection of society.  However, our prisons are overflowing with people against whom society needs no protection.  My type of restorative justice would see the parking fine or TV licence evader doing charity work instead of going to prison.  My type of restorative justice would allow people guilty of drunken public order offences to serve a positive sentence of weeding the flower beds in a local park for a month or emptying litter bins.  This Bill does not provide for that type of scenario.<\/p><p>  I also worry that the provisions before us today would encourage those who are accused of a crime but are innocent to plead guilty in order to commence a compensation process and receive a mitigated sentence.  That would be an unwelcome development in our laws.  I am also unhappy with the aspect of the Bill that requires garda&iacute; to prepare compensation calculations.  We currently have healthy air space between the garda&iacute; and the Judiciary in our justice system.  For over a month, I have been arguing for the same respectful distance to be created between the garda&iacute; and the Government.  I do not think it would be good for the independence of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether as prosecuting agents or as supporter of victims, to become embroiled in the judicial act of sentencing.  To legislate for restorative justice is a fine idea and I look forward to upcoming proposals from the Minister for Justice and Equality in that regard.  However, the proposal before us is not the answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600073#VVV00200","speaker":"1105"},{"type":"speech","time":1395867600,"counter":892,"content":"<p>I propose to share time with Deputies Healy, Wallace, Clare Daly, and Ross.  I support the Restorative Justice (Reparation of Victims) Bill 2013.  I have listened to points raised by people saying that restorative justice should be brought into modern legislation.  It has been brought in recently in the North.  Restorative justice is not a new thing; rather, it is thousands of years old.  Under Brehon laws in Ireland, compensation was the mode of justice in most crimes.<\/p><p>  The modern legal system is based on the concept that crime is not an injury to the person but an offence against the State.  This was hammered home to me a few years ago when the son of a friend of mine was murdered.  The State stepped in to represent the person who was murdered but the barrister had no obligation to deal with the victim's family.  In this case, the barrister had the goodwill to speak to the family and explain what was happening in the case but, otherwise, the family would have been excluded.  They would have had to go into the courts and listen to what was said about their son.  This hammered home the nature of our system, which is not based on victims or dealing with victims' issues.  It deals with an offence against the State.<\/p><p>  It is a system based on punishment and it does not work.  The most recent CSO figures indicate that 50% of people released from prison reoffend within three years.  That is a high rate.  Certain types of criminals are a danger to people.  Should they be in prison?  Yes.  If someone rapes somebody, he or she should be in prison.  Repeat offenders should be in prison if they have no remorse or concern for the impact their actions have on victims.  Restorative justice can be effective in confronting young offenders, from 18 years of age up, with the consequences of their actions.  They must be confronted with the impact on victims.  Making restitution to victims can be part of the process of helping them to go straight and not to reoffend.  Offenders who genuinely engage with victims and who genuinely seek to make restitution through payment or otherwise should have this amount to an alternative to prison.  It should be taken into account.  Restorative justice has been shown to be extremely beneficial to victims of crime, helping them to get over trauma, get on with their lives, overcome the fear of being victimised again and to deal with their anger or desire for revenge.  It is a process that should be examined by this Government.<\/p><p>The Government signed up to the European Council directive on compensation for crime victims.  It is not contrary to the intention of the Government to sign up to a form of restorative justice.  The Bill moves the process on and provides a good basis for the introduction of a system of restorative justice.  Children are not involved as the criminal courts only deal with those aged over 18 years.  The mentally ill are not involved either as they cannot be tried.  All of the issues being thrown into the mix are intended to muddy the waters.  The proposals made by Deputy John Halligan are very specific.  The Bill provides a good outline of the way to proceed.  I am sure he would welcome support from the Government to amend the Bill, but its essence is a positive step forward and should be considered as part of a restorative justice process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600073#VVV00300","speaker":"1032","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395868200,"counter":894,"content":"<p>Other speakers have referred to the fact that many countries have had a system of restorative justice in place for some time.  The Bill raises various issues and principles of restorative justice &ndash; community restorative justice, the rights of victims and support services for them.  I am sure Deputy John Halligan would agree that the Bill would benefit from the legislative process in the House.  He has not had access to a legal draftsman and the Bill would benefit from going through Committee Stage by way of refinement through amendment and the extension of sections.  The Bill could be supported with a view to improving, refining and amending it through the legislative process.<\/p><p>  We should never lose sight of the fact that prevention is always better than the cure.  Not only is that the case but there are also significant social and financial advantages in the prevention of crime.  It is important to ensure every family has an equal opportunity to be socially included, to be part of life in their area and to have a reasonable quality of life.  It is important to remember the factors that make for good social conditions.  If we were to improve social conditions, crime would also be addressed.  I refer to education, in particular for young people.  I accept that there is a free preschool year, but it must be extended.  Moneys invested in young people at an early age result in a significant payback over time.<\/p><p>  Other factors to be considered are the improvement of educational facilities and opportunities for young people, as well as the improvement of housing conditions for families.  There are 98,000 families on local authority housing lists.  Employment opportunities are a considerable issue.  It is hugely advantageous for families to see parents and siblings employed.  That is vitally important.  The payback is significant, both socially and economically when employment is available.<\/p><p>  The provision of community facilities is important.  The support of RAPID programmes is crucial in that regard, but, unfortunately, such funding has been withdrawn.  We must provide community facilities and support communities.  We must also put in place community services, but the funding for such services has been consistently cut back by the Government.  Many of the programmes available to deprived communities across the country have lost their funding.  The provision of community facilities such as youth services results in a significant payback over time, both socially and economically.<\/p><p>  Approximately 1,500 garda&iacute; have left the system in recent years.  Community policing services have suffered most.  Community garda&iacute; on the beat build trust and confidence and make connections with young people and youth services in deprived areas.  The service should, therefore, be reintroduced in communities.  <\/p><p>  I support the Bill and would like to see it progressing to Committee Stage, at which point it would be amended and refined.  We should never lose sight of the fact that prevention is always better than the cure.  We should, therefore, provide for investment in services in these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600074#WWW00200","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1395868200,"counter":895,"content":"<p>I presume the idea of restorative justice means restoring justice, but it must be very difficult to restore justice in the majority of situations.

Not only do they not learn very much but sometimes they seem to come out with more problems.  We have seen figures for the numbers of offenders who have spent time in prison and reoffended.  They are frightening and should put us off throwing them into prison in the first place.<\/p><p>  The Criminal Justice Alliance in the United Kingdom defines restorative justice as a process in which everyone involved comes together to talk about impact of a crime and what needs to happen to repair the harm caused.  It can take place at any stage in the criminal justice system, and outside it, and has clear benefits, including high victim satisfaction rates, reductions in the levels of reoffending and cost savings for the criminal justice system.  I do not agree with the idea that the scheme should be restricted solely to financial reparation.  The vast majority of those who commit crimes could probably not afford to pay back financially for the damage they cause because most of them have no money as most of them come from deprived backgrounds.  If we seriously want to challenge crime, we must engage more proactively in tackling poverty and inequality.<\/p><p>Sadly, inequality is growing rather than decreasing.

It would not have given me any satisfaction to see them thrown in prison.  I can remember a brand new mini-digger being burned to a cinder one night and a JCB being burned another night.  Needless to say, I was not very pleased with the guys who did it even though I did not see them.  I had a fair idea that their being thrown in jail would not give me any benefit either.  I would have liked to have met and had a chat with them.  I would also have liked to have got them to do some work for me free of charge.

I argued with the right honourable Minister, Deputy Shatter, during the debate on the Fines Bill, that we should be using community service much more.  It is a better idea than attaching orders or throwing people in prison.<\/p><p> Another issue that springs to mind is that I had a son thrown out of a secondary school having been accused of doing something he did not do.  The <i>Sunday Independent <\/i>flashed the story all over the front page but it forgot to print the story when his appeal was upheld and he got back into the school.  I do not know how that slipped its mind.  It was amazing.<\/p><p> The idea of throwing kids out of school for one thing or another is counter-productive.  If kids are found guilty of doing something they should not have done, keeping them back at the end of the school and making them do some physical work for a few hours every evening for a considerable length of time, depending on the offence involved, would make much more sense than throwing them out of school.  It would also be more productive.<\/p><p> I am certainly in favour of the person who commits the crime engaging with his or her victim.  That can be educational for both sides and both can learn from it.  It is something we should put energy into and try to make happen more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600074#WWW00300","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395868800,"counter":897,"content":"<p>It has been a very long day and there were unusual occurrences in the House.  Perhaps that is the reason we had to listen to some pretty peculiar contributions from some Deputies.  We heard a Deputy say they think legal aid is okay and that they do not have a problem with it but that it is very annoying when people keep using it.  They then tried to blame the problems of the legal aid system on those who have the misfortune to be before the courts on multiple occasions.  There is no doubt that is annoying but it is much more than that.  The idea of penalising people and asking them, as the Deputy put forward, to pay for the legal aid themselves is ridiculous when a huge number of those people come from a background where they would not have the means to pay for it.  The issue should be why people are in a process where they repeatedly offend and whether we can do something and put in place measures which avoid that happening.  That would be good for the victims of crime and for society.  The reality is, and the statistics show, that the majority of those who appear before the courts and end up behind bars come from backgrounds where there is a certain hopelessness, a lack of economic progress, a lack of investment and so on.  Encouragement in education and investment in communities is far better for society in the long term.<\/p><p>  The concept of restorative justice is a fundamental and important one.  It could be summarised as trying to get people to take responsibility for their actions.  When people take responsibility, they understand better the consequences of the action and they are likely to modify their behaviour accordingly.  I note that all research would say the process should be voluntary and that it always should be.  I can appreciate that on one level but I can imagine many situations where it would not be the inclination of the perpetrator of the crime to engage in that process and simply having it on a voluntary basis might not be enough.  We need to be proactive in encouraging people to participate in this route because if they see the damage of their crimes, they are less likely to offend because most people are decent, and that is an important principle.<\/p><p>  I got an e-mail this afternoon from a person on a matter not linked necessarily to this issue.  I want to refer to some of what it states because the woman called the subject matter of the e-mail &quot;Victim of a Crime&quot;.  She started off by telling me her name.  She stated that four years ago in February 2010 she was stabbed outside a primary school in Tralee in Kerry.  She also stated that she brought this to the attention of the Garda but nothing was done.  She further stated that two years later in February 2012 the same guy attacked her again, this time outside her house and caused injury to her face, and once again the Garda failed to pursue it and continued to fail to do anything about it.  She stated that he was supposed to go to court but nothing was done to date.  She also stated that she has no confidence in the Garda.  She further stated that she cannot go anywhere as she does not feel safe, as this guy may come back and attack her again or, worse, attack her family, as the same guy threatened her youngest son.  She stated that she would appreciate if I would bring this matter to the attention of the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  What does a victim like that want?  The woman wants a right to live in her community.  She wants the right to know that the person who was guilty of the crimes against her is being dealt with and, critically she does not want to feel endangered any more.  The question for us is how that will be achieved.  The first thing is that the crimes must be investigated.  That is critical.  Sadly, myself, Deputy Wallace and Deputy Joan Collins, in particular, have met multiple people over the past period who are the victims of injustice but who have had that injustice compounded by the fact that the justice system, as it currently stands, failed them.  Their cases were not investigated.  Sometimes they were just tragic instances that life throws up in people's past where they become a victim for no real reason.  They just end up in that situation because of accidental factors, but what happens next compounds that and they cannot get closure.  The issue of restorative justice is attempting to deal with some of those questions.<\/p><p>  I have a problem with the idea of financial compensation.  We discussed it during the passage of the fines legislation when the Minister, Deputy Shatter, put forward fines as an alternative to a penal sentence.  I am completely opposed to penal sentences in general for most crimes but fines in many instances are ridiculous and community service is a better alternative.  We need to take into account people's ability to pay.  For example, most crime is committed by people who do not have money.  If a junkie breaks into one's house to get money to buy drugs, they are not going to have the money to pay one back if they do that damage.  Investing in getting that person off drugs is probably a more sustainable solution.  I am really in favour of the idea of people meeting those against whom they carried out a crime.  An apology can often mean the closure a person needs.  Just being face to face and to have the other person understand the consequences of their actions is hugely important.  We need to move away from the idea of penal sentences and to take a much more holistic approach where the victim's interests and the person who carries out the crime are taken into account so there is less re-offending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600075#XXX00200","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1395868800,"counter":898,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, I thank Deputy Halligan for bringing forward this Bill and assure the House that the Minister shares the Deputy's concerns to ensure the interests of victims are at the heart of the criminal justice process.<\/p><p>I would like to address some of the specific points raised by Deputies during the debate.  With regard to the policing response to burglaries, the Minister is confident that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is devoting all resources necessary to confront those who seek to profit from burglary crimes.  Robust Garda action in this area is reflected in the most recent official CSO crime statistics, which show the national rate of burglary decreased by 10.4% for the 12 months ending 30 September 2013.  This continues a downward trend in the overall number of burglaries which has been evident since the end of 2012.  Of course, any statistical improvements are of little comfort to those who have been the victims of burglary crimes.  The Minister is very conscious of the deep distress that such crimes can cause householders in urban and rural areas, as well as the broader impact they can have in terms of fear of crime in our communities.  In this regard the Minister emphasises the progress being made regarding Operation Fiacla, which is the national Garda operation focused on identifying and targeting gangs involved in burglaries.  Operation Fiacla is intelligence-driven and includes specific burglary-related initiatives which have been implemented in each Garda region to target suspect offenders.  The Garda authorities have indicated that as of the end of February this year 8,344 persons have been arrested and 4,755 persons have been charged under Operation Fiacla, reflecting the extent and impact of the operation.  The implementation of Operation Fiacla and its regional support operations continues alongside ongoing community policing measures.<\/p><p> A number of Deputies expressed concern about Garda station closures.  The recent Garda district and station consolidation programme is one of the current strategic development programmes being undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This programme provides for effectiveness and efficiencies through the restructuring and reconfiguration of service delivery methods.  The revised structures will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's community policing philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs.  The centralisation of services facilitates the introduction of an enhanced patrolling system and is operational and intelligence-led.  This patrol system will ensure that a highly visible and community-oriented policing service will continue to be delivered throughout the country.<\/p><p> Decisions on the provision and allocation of Garda transport, including the type and specification of vehicles, are a matter for the Garda authorities in light of their identified requirements.  Operational circumstances are fully taken into account when new vehicles are ordered.  The Government's recent investment in the Garda fleet resulted in the purchase of 305 new Garda vehicles towards the end of 2013 at a cost of &euro;5 million.  These were in addition to the 133 Garda vehicles that had already been procured during the year.  Another &euro;4 million has been made available for the purchase and fit-out of Garda transport in 2014.  This is a clear indication of the Minister's commitment to ensure that to the greatest extent possible An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is provided with sufficient resources to enable it to deliver an effective and efficient policing service.<\/p><p> The issue of legal aid for repeat offenders has also been mentioned by Deputies.  Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 the courts are responsible for granting legal aid to accused persons whose means are insufficient to pay for legal representation.  A person's previous convictions are not a criterion for assessment for legal aid under the Act.  Deputies will appreciate that the legal aid scheme operates with due regard to the State's obligations under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights on appropriate legal representation for persons charged with criminal offences.<\/p><p> Deputies may be aware an ongoing review of penal policy is being conducted by a working group established by the Minister in September 2012.  This group has been asked to conduct a wide-ranging examination and analysis of penal policy, including sentencing policy and the reintegration and rehabilitation of offenders.  Among other matters, this review is also required to take into account the perspective of those who are victims of crime.  This group is expected to report shortly after Easter.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy Halligan for bringing the Bill before the House.  While the Government shares his concerns with regard to ensuring that the rights and needs of victims of offences are a central consideration in the criminal justice process, in view of the difficulties identified with the provisions of the Bill, the Government cannot agree to its being read a second time.  This has been a very worthwhile debate and we thank Deputy Halligan for this opportunity.  I am sure that when the Minister brings forward his proposals the Deputy will be quite satisfied with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600075#XXX00300","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395869400,"counter":900,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Halligan on bringing forward this timely and important Bill.  It contains some excellent provisions to deal with the escalating number of intrusions into family homes and properties.  The loss of valuables and items of sentimental value and the general destruction that occurs have a huge psychological and stressful impact on the victims of such crime.  Victims feel insecure and in many cases they feel powerless to defend themselves and their properties afterwards.<\/p><p>  A typical recent example is that of the elderly man living alone in west Clare who, after several events threatening his well-being, fled from his home late at night and cycled a very long journey to a safe haven in a nursing home in Ennis.  The result is that he will probably never again return to his homestead.  He has been prematurely removed from his environment, his neighbourhood and all his friends.  This man has been institutionalised by force.  It is a typical example of what is happening, particularly with people living alone who are the victims of criminality.<\/p><p>  In 2009 the National Commission on Restorative Justice recommended that a restorative prospective be introduced nationally to the Irish criminal justice system.  Unfortunately the report has been left on the shelf gathering dust, although it includes many positive recommendations which could be incorporated into Deputy Halligan's Bill.  Perhaps his proposals could act as a catalyst to tie in with the report, which was commissioned by the Government at the time.  I am sure a very efficient committee was in place which came up with some very good suggestions.  It provided a very good formula for restorative justice and reparation.  We should not throw out Deputy Halligan's Bill very easily.  Much thought has been put into it and it is very rational and logical.  We should give it real consideration and send it to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The least it deserves is for this to happen.<\/p><p>  The commission estimated the cost per case of a probation order to be &euro;8,200 and that of a community service order to be &euro;2,000.  The supervision of a suspended or deferred sentence was estimated to be &euro;5,500.  By comparison, the average annual cost of keeping an offender in prison is approximately &euro;120,000.  In the absence of research-based evidence and relevant supporting data, the commission in its report opted to develop the estimates of the potential wider application of restorative justice based on 2007 court and prison data and a cautious assumption of the level of case referrals and case outcomes and the mix of cases which may be diverted from current disposals.  The commission offered a tentative projection of a wider application of restorative justice in respect of adults on criminal charges before the courts at between 3,265 and 7,250 per annum.<\/p><p>In the absence of research-based evidence and based on certain assumptions, the commission projects that annually, between 290 and 579 persons due to be sanctioned before the courts could be diverted from being given a custodial sentence where a restorative option is applied.  The commission estimates that diversion from custodial sentences of this range could lead to a reduction of between 40 to 125 prison spaces per annum.  It estimates this level of reduction could generate potential savings in prison costs of between &euro;4.1 million and &euro;8.3 million.  The assumptions applied in making these projections are considered to be modest and do not include savings that would arise from lower rates of reoffending in the future due to restorative interventions.  The projections excluded savings from reduced demand for prison spaces due to part-suspended sentences as a restorative option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600076#YYY00200","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1395870000,"counter":902,"content":"<p>First, I thank all those Members, from all sides of the House, who made valuable and quite excellent contributions.  I thank the Minister of State for her kind words earlier this evening and I thank my legal team, who helped me to put together the Bill.  In addition, I thank members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who were quite excellent in helping me with the Bill, as well as the many groups and in particular, the Support After Crime Services in Cork, Limerick, Clare, Tipperary and Waterford, whose founding member, Ms Sally Hanlon, was quite helpful to me.  I also thank many members of victim support groups nationwide.<\/p><p>  I am aware that many Deputies from all sides of the House would like to be able to return to their constituencies and tell their constituents they are supporting the Bill.  This is because any Deputy who works on the ground knows full well the devastating impact that burglaries have on communities throughout the country.  They also know how completely powerless victims can be.  I reiterate the point I made last night, which is that a burglary takes place every 19 minutes, according to statistics from the Central Statistics Office.  Consequently, by the time this debate concludes this evening, another four or five homes will have been ransacked.  Another four or five families will return home or will wake up to scenes of devastation, their security will have been shattered and treasured items will be gone forever.  I ask Members to think about such families and not the burglars when they vote on this Bill.  This is because the Bill primarily is about victims and not the convicted.<\/p><p>  Some Members of my legal team were listening to the Minister's response last night and were quite taken aback with some of the information in that response.  I wish to go through some points that were made.  First, he spoke about the rights of the accused but this Bill does not mention the rights of the accused.  If one is accused, one has not been convicted.  This Bill deals specifically with those who have been convicted of the offence.  One then must determine whether one should deal with the rights of the victims or the convicted.  All those accused have rights and one is not guilty because one is accused.  I was shocked, as was my legal team, to hear the Minister mention the rights of the accused last night.<\/p><p>  The Minister also referred to section 6 of the 1993 Act.  During the debate, much was made by the Minister and some Government Deputies of the compensation clause built into section 6 of the 1993 Act.  What was not mentioned by the Minister -  again I was taken aback by this - is that section 6 always is at the discretion of the judge.  Section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 provides that where a defendant is convicted of an offence, the court may make an order requiring him or her to pay compensation in respect of personal injury or loss suffered by the victims as a result of the offence.  However, the decision on whether a compensation order is made currently is at the discretion of the court.  The Minister gave out wrong information here last night, which gave the implication that it already was in being that compensation was a prerequisite for people who went to court but this is not the case.<\/p><p>  The Minister spoke about victims' consent and the point was made that this Bill does not take into account a victim's consent.  It was suggested that an offer of reparation could be perceived as a means by which a convicted burglar could buy his or her way out of the sentence.  This is a ridiculous suggestion.  The Bill does not propose the payment of compensation as an alternative to a custodial sentence.  Under the terms of the Bill, sentencing would take place irrespective of whether reparation was made voluntarily.  I also was deeply shocked by Deputy Ferris when she brought up the horrendous crime of rape.  This Bill specifically pertains to burglaries and invasion of the home.  I made it quite clear in this Bill that it would be incumbent upon a judge, irrespective of the bestowal of a custodial sentence or a community sentence, that reparation would be paid to the victim.  Consequently, it has nothing to do with this.  I made a point of not commenting on minimum or maximum sentencing or whatever.  During the abortion debate, I had rape victims as guests in the Gallery and they know my views on rape and on how women are treated and violated and on how victims are treated.  I wished to be quite clear in that regard and while I like Deputy Ferris, perhaps she had not read part of the Bill.<\/p><p>  The rights of the accused also were mentioned at length - far more than the rights of the victim - to not have his or her home violated, from what I could make out.  What is clear in the Bill is that the payment of reparation applies to those convicted of a burglary.  I must make this point quite clear.  The rights of the accused are clear in Irish law and this Bill in no way infringes on due process and a fair trial.  The suggestion was made that the Bill could infringe on the rights of juveniles or those suffering from mental health issues.  Again, my legal team were shocked to hear the Minister speak about this last night.  Everyone is aware that those considered incompetent under the law will not be brought to trial and all of this is taken into consideration already in Irish law.  This Bill is addressing cases in which adults of sound mental health are convicted in an Irish court of law.  Again, my legal team, when going through the Bill this morning with me, recognised that the Minister mentioned the rights of children.  This is a Bill directed at adult defendants, that is, adults who are convicted.  Moreover, an adult is someone who is 18 years of age or more, while a child under Irish law is someone who is under 18 years of age.<\/p><p>  Someone mentioned the assessment from the Garda.  As matters stand, if one's home is broken into and money or precious items or jewellery are taken from one's home, one's first port of call is the Garda to give a report as to what has been taken and one gives such an assessment to the Garda.  When one contacts an insurance company, its representatives ask for that.  They ask whether one has gone to the Garda, what has been taken and whether one can give an assessment, has receipts and so on.  The garda&iacute; would have been the first people to whom one would have gone.  Moreover, those who spoke up about the assessment from the Garda appear to be forgetting that if someone is convicted, it will have been because the Garda found the items or will have induced that person to make a statement as to what he or she had taken from the house and the damage he or she had done.  I see no problem with a garda appearing before to the court to state he or she accepts that this particular house of such a person was broken into and this is what was taken or stolen.<\/p><p>  The meeting with victims was mentioned.  While I have no problem with a perpetrator meeting the victim under restorative justice, many victims do not want this to happen - one can speak to all victims' groups in this regard.  In the first instance, they are too shocked and upset and they are afraid.  In the context of restorative justice, had it been amended and included within the Bill, I would not exclude it.  However, I wished to make clear that many victims find that as of yet, they are not quite up to meeting someone who has broken into their house, damaged their property or assaulted them.<\/p><p>  The Government's plans to introduce new restorative justice measures also were appraised.  However, what was not specified is that the Government proposes to give victims of crime the right to accept reparation payment from the offender in question.  Members should bear in mind that the right to feel safe and secure in one's own home already has been ripped from the victim and the Government's response is to create a framework within Irish criminal law whereby if the person convicted of breaking into one's home, who possibly may have 100 other convictions under his or her belt, feels sufficiently remorseful to offer compensation, then the victim will have the right to accept such payment.  I do not call that justice for the victim.  Do Members honestly consider that to be an appropriate response to the rights of the victim?  I would be interested to meet the offender, who may have been availing of free legal aid for many years, who will voluntarily make such reparation.<\/p><p>This is the difficulty for victims' groups with whom one speaks.  I was quite clear in putting this Bill together and I met approximately 20 families whose homes had been broken into and I spoke to victims' groups throughout the country.<\/p><p> The basic aim of the reparation proposal from the Minister for Justice and Equality is to reduce the overall number of custodial sentences for crimes at District Court level.  No thought has been given to the victim.  The reparation process, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, alluded, would certainly not be considered a fair and balanced one.  Restorative justice is about the idea that because crime hurts, justice must heal.  The victim of the home burglary deserves justice in the same way as any other victim and if that justice has to come via deductions from the criminal's means of living, whether his or her wages, pension or social welfare payment, then so be it.  <\/p><p> If the Bill had gone to Committee Stage, I would have been prepared to accept amendments.  I am deeply disappointed the Government has not agreed to that.  As I said, I put a huge effort into this Bill, as did all groups from the legal team to the Garda to victims' rights groups.  It is disappointing to think it will not be allowed to progress to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600077#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1094","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1395870600,"counter":904,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 24; N\u00edl, 71.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies John Halligan and Thomas Pringle; N\u00edl, Deputies Paul Kehoe and Emmet Stagg.<\/p><p>Question declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032600078#AAAA00300","aye":["1096","1032","1083","1101","1037","976","1047","1050","1094","960","1049","983","962","1017","993","981","969","1044","1054","1028","984","1005","1001","970"],"nay":["980","974","1079","989","1029","1030","1042","1092","1031","972","1041","1093","1099","1006","986","994","1091","1046","968","1007","1011","1103","957","1078","1085","1068","1051","995","1106","973","1098","1021","1110","1053","990","982","1023","1038","996","1180","997","1082","977","1026","1004","1070","1034","1067","1056","1045","1018","1060","1058","1069","1073","971","1061","1081","964","966","952","1013","1048","961","978","1010","1095","948","950","1185","1024"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1395870600,"counter":905,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 11.05 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 March 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
