While this month will see the end of the 1916 Rising commemorations, centenary commemorations will commence again on the anniversary of the death of Thomas Ashe who, of course, was born in Lispole, County Kerry.  He was involved in the 1916 Rising, tried on the same day as &Eacute;amon de Valera and sentenced to death, a sentence which was commuted to one of penal servitude.  He went on hunger strike with another Kerry man, Austin Stack, during which he was forcibly fed.<\/p> <p>While we celebrate and commemorate the bravery of the men of 1916, the 100th anniversary of the death of Thomas Ashe is relevant because the forcible feeding of prisoners continues to this day, most notably at Guantanamo Bay.  While we mark the anniversary of his death, we must also highlight the fact that the death he endured and the punishment he received - he remained on a cold prison cell floor in a weakened condition for 50 hours before being subjected to forced feeding - constituted human rights abuses that continue to happen today.  That is part of the reason we must highlight the injustices that continue to happen today, even though we will be commemorating an event that happened 100 years ago.<\/p> <p>What does the Government plant to do to commemorate the anniversary of the death of Thomas Ashe and highlight human rights issues, in particular the abuse of the rights of prisoners and the abuses perpetrated by countries with which we are great friends?  That friendship does not mean that we will not criticise them when they are wrong.  When the United States of America engages in the form of punishment it uses for prisoners, we must not be silent.  We must stand up for the rights of prisoners, irrespective of the reasons for which they are imprisoned.

I am taking this item on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, who unfortunately cannot attend the House.<\/p> <p>On Easter Monday of this year, 28 March, a State ceremony took place in Ashbourne, County Meath, to remember Commandant Thomas Ashe and all of those who gave their lives arising from the events of the Battle of Ashbourne.  This was one of a number of formal State ceremonial events to take place around the country this year to reflect the special significance of key regional locations in the events of the 1916 Rising and to honour and remember those who fought and those who died.  I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the assistance of Meath County Council and Fingal County Council in supporting this very special commemoration.<\/p> <p>Some of the most significant Volunteer action outside of Dublin took place at Rathcross, Ashbourne, under the leadership of Thomas Ashe, Richard Mulcahy and Frank Lawless.  Thirteen men in total lost their lives in Ashbourne on 28 April 1916.  Commandant Thomas Ashe was tried by court martial and his death sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life.  He died in September 1917.<\/p> <p>This year, we have remembered and reflected upon the ultimate sacrifice made by Ashe and all those who gave their lives in order that Ireland&rsquo;s dream of self-determination could become a reality.  My Department is currently considering how the centenary of the death of Thomas Ashe should be appropriately marked and is being assisted by the guidance and advice of the expert advisory group on commemorations in these deliberations.<\/p> <p>The 1916 centenary commemorations were inclusive, respectful and measured, and sought to strengthen peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  The Ireland 2016 centenary programme met with widespread support across the political, academic and community sectors.  It has engaged our communities at home and abroad in an unprecedented way and the benefits at community level and indeed nationally cannot be underestimated.  The inclusive nature of the programme has enabled citizens to really examine our history and has encouraged them to consider the future of their communities.  It gave people scope to think about the events of 1916 and its legacy in a way that is personal and meaningful to each individual.  The Government will continue to mark significant events throughout the decade of centenaries and the State's commemorative programme will be based on the inclusive, open and consultative approach that has worked so well this year.<\/p> <p>At all times, the Government has been supported in its plans by the guidance and advice of the expert advisory group on commemorations and the Oireachtas all-party consultation group on commemorations.  The expert group is currently considering the issue of guidance around the approach to the second half of the decade of centenaries.  The centenary of the death of Commandant Thomas Ashe will be marked on 25 September 2017.  In addition, next year we will remember the battle of Messines and will commemorate the death of Francis Ledwidge in the third Battle of Ypres on 31 July.<\/p> <p>In 2018, we will mark the end of the First World War and the general election of 1918 and then move on to commemorate the First D&aacute;il in January 2019.  Commemorating the period of the War of Independence and Civil War will present its own challenges.  However, I strongly believe the same open and honest approach which we used for this year&rsquo;s successful commemorations, which allowed all narratives to be heard, will ensure we will be able to reflect appropriately on the all of the major historical events as they unfolded.<\/p> <p>In terms of funding for commemorations, the Department is currently considering the funding breakdown for commemorations in 2017 in the context of finalising the commemoration programme for next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#B00100","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I know that the Minister of State is only reading the answer but, for his benefit, the question asked the Minister \"to outline the Government's plans to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the death of Thomas Ashe and to state the budget allocation for the commemorations\".

The Department will be happy to engage with relevant groups, including local authorities and third-level institutions on how the centenary of the death of Thomas Ashe might be appropriately commemorated next year.  The inclusive, respectful and measured approach which characterised this year's centenary commemorations will continue to shape the State's commemorative programme for the remainder of the decade.

I am glad the Minister of State is attending the House to address this serious and urgent issue that has come to my attention.  It concerns an e-mail sent to personnel in HSE West, which baldly stated that any patient attending addiction counsellors in the mental health services must have co-morbid mental illness and addiction and be under the care of the relevant catchment area consultant.  It states that anyone who is not under the care of a consultant should be discharged back to their general practitioner.  The same e-mail asked its recipients to please confirm that all addiction counsellors in their areas only treat people who have mental health issues as well as addiction.<\/p> <p>This is a very frightening turn of events in the Galway west and south Mayo area, in particular, but I know that the mental health services also cover Galway and Roscommon.  It has been brought to my attention that GPs will no longer be able to refer patients with an alcohol addiction to the HSE services unless they have been diagnosed with a co-morbid mental health illness.  That means that scores of patients receiving support will be left high and dry in the run up to Christmas and that GPs will have nowhere to send patients who present with alcohol addiction problems for the foreseeable future unless they have the additional diagnosis.  I find this decision to be totally unacceptable.  Christmas is obviously a pressure point for families where someone has an alcohol addiction problem.  I understand that this decision was taken on the advice of senior psychiatric personnel and that people working in this sector have been completely taken aback by the decision and the fallout that will ensue.  According to the recent Galway city alcohol strategy, a total of 38% of alcohol drinkers screened positive for alcohol problems, 22% for alcohol abuse and 11% for alcohol dependency.  One in five reported one or more harms due to their own drinking and one in four people reported one or more harms as a result of someone else's drinking.  Therefore, this is an issue which affects families of people with alcohol-related problems, as well as those with such problems themselves.  <\/p> <p>Galway has a population of over 75,000 but there is only one full-time and one part-time counsellor for over-18s who are problematic drinkers.  Waterford, by comparison, which has a population of 47,000 has five counsellors that are accessible to drinkers, as well as one outreach worker, 1.5 workers for under-18s, a hospital liaison nurse, a liaison nurse in other projects and a clinical psychologist.  Limerick and Tralee also leave us in the ha'penny place, given the level of such services provided there.  <\/p> <p>Galway has been historically completely under-resourced for dealing with the issues surrounding alcohol addiction.  I note that the Minister of State was in Galway recently when we both attended a consultation on the future drugs task force policy there.  When she was there, the Minister of State heard at first hand the problems being faced on the ground.  We have seen cuts to services in Ballinasloe, Merlin Park, the western region drugs task force and elsewhere that have exacerbated the problems.  However, this new cut to services is totally unacceptable and must be reversed immediately.  I will write to the management of HSE West but a strong intervention by the Minister of State, who has responsibility for this area, would be very useful.<\/p> <p>I note there is a particular problem locally in Galway in that services tend to be pigeonholed either into drugs or alcohol services, where most people presenting with one or other of those issues have a poly-use problem.  There are also issues with prescription drugs and other drugs people are using.  There generally tend to be social and health problems associated with them.  The fact is, however, that a vital service such as addiction counselling under the HSE is being limited in such a way that only people who have a dual diagnosis can be seen.  That means that people who are currently receiving supports from the addiction services will no longer be able to avail of them.  In addition, GPs cannot refer people who present as problem cases between now and Christmas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is totally unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#B00500","speaker":"1377","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter, but I am afraid that he will not be very happy with my reply.  I am not happy with it and will explain why.<\/p> <p>The Government is committed to tackling alcohol misuse in Ireland and the widespread harm and pain it causes.  Alcohol is causing significant damage across the population and in workplaces, families and communities and is a substantial burden on everyone in Irish society.  Individuals with an addiction to alcohol access the full range of general health services, including primary care, secondary care, social care and mental health services.  There are also specific addiction services.  People who present for alcohol addiction treatment are offered a range of interventions, namely, initial assessment, comprehensive assessment, the Minnesota programme, brief intervention, individual counselling, self-help, peer support or a combination of these.  The delivery of these services is based on the Four Tier model of treatment intervention and services are designed to respond to an individual's specific identified needs.<\/p> <p>Responding effectively to the co-existence of substance use and mental health disorders presents a challenge for treatment services in several ways.  Among the issues that make treatment complicated are those surrounding the assessment of patients, the types of combination treatment they require and the specific context and settings within which services are provided for them.  The HSE has recently established a national clinical programme for co-morbid mental illness and substance misuse.  This clinical programme will commence early in 2017 with the aim of recommending a comprehensive model of care to respond to this serious clinical issue.  A national working group under the direction of a national clinical lead will be convened to progress this model of care.  It will include an examination of residential co-morbid treatment and recovery settings.  The existence of problems relating to the treatment and care of individuals with a dual diagnosis is common across European treatment services owing to the separation of mental health and drug use treatment networks.  The establishment of the national clinical programme is a major step towards recognising this problem and taking specific steps to deal with it.  <\/p> <p>The current practice of Galway Mayo and Roscommon CHO Area 2 mental health services is that access to mental health services is via referral by a GP to a consultant-led multi-disciplinary team that will conduct a core assessment and arrange care, as appropriate.  This principle applies to all services within our remit, including alcohol addiction services.  In line with national policy, CHO Area 2 mental health services will continue to prioritise and respond to people with a co-morbidity of alcohol addiction and mental health problems.  <\/p> <p>The issue of support for those with an alcohol addiction will also be considered as part of national strategy development, most particularly in developing the new drugs strategy and in the review of A Vision for Change.  It is essential to have a public health policy response which seeks to reduce the number engaged in the harmful use of alcohol.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill contains a package of measures aimed at reducing alcohol consumption in Ireland to 9.1 litres per person per annum, the OECD average in 2012, as well as the harm associated with alcohol.  With other measures, the Bill will bring about a cultural shift in how we view and consume alcohol.  As a consequence, we will see an improvement in both physical and mental health well-being in the population.  The Bill commenced Committee Stage in the Seanad on 26 October and the debate will resume in the next session of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#C00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I appreciate the answer, but to be honest, it is nonsensical.

I am told that the limiting of the service whereby GPs can refer people to the alcohol addiction service in Merlin Park hospital in Galway flies in the face of that statement.  It will cause huge problems for those who are already being seen by alcohol addiction services and will cause a lot of stress for families during the Christmas person when the problem is exacerbated and families find themselves in very difficult territory with a family a member who has an alcohol abuse problem.

I hope he will have good news on this occasion too.  <\/p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware that Rural Resettlement Ireland, a housing NGO that was begun by Mr. Jim Connolly in Kilbaha in west Clare, has been responsible for relocating hundreds of families from Dublin to towns and villages all over the country.  The children of those families went to village schools and their children are now going to village schools.  Many schools were able to keep extra teachers, certainly in the 1980s and early 1990s, because of the wonderful families from inner city Dublin who had difficulty in finding housing in Dublin and were welcomed with open arms in rural communities.  There are dozens of such families in west Clare who have successfully relocated from Dublin.  <\/p> <p>I have been contacted by people in counties Leitrim and Mayo to ask why the scheme is not being promoted more, channelled or energised by the Government.  My understanding is Rural Resettlement Ireland no longer receives State funding.  Will the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government recommit to funding this concept?  I have no doubt that many of the families who find themselves in the desperate position of being homeless in Dublin and who are living in bed and breakfast accommodation or hotel rooms would welcome the opportunity to relocate to a town or village that could do with the extra numbers because of depopulation.  It is not the answer for everyone.  Many people who find themselves in this situation want to stay in Dublin to be near their families and loved ones, but Government policy should support and facilitate those who wish to relocate to start a new life on another part of our great island.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> What are the views of the Minister of State on this?

We need to think outside the box.  We need to view the housing crisis as requiring an all-Ireland strategy.  Where there are difficulties and challenges there are opportunities for other communities, villages, towns, GAA clubs and schools.  It is not a Dublin, Cork or Limerick problem.

While my Department does not operate a specific rural resettlement programme, the recently published Rebuilding Ireland includes a range of measures supportive of the regeneration and renewal of towns and villages throughout rural Ireland, consequently ensuring a vibrant population in these places.  As the Senator stated, there can be positive outcomes, and more than 800 families have been relocated with great success over the years, mainly from Dublin, to many of the counties he mentioned including Clare, Mayo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo and Galway.  I know some of the families who later relocated to my county of Meath.  They were delighted to have had the opportunity to relocate from Dublin to Roscommon.  It is important that we have an opportunity for this to happen.  It makes total sense to facilitate people in unsatisfactory or temporary accommodation in Dublin who would like to resettle.  I am very interested in trying to achieve this.  We are interested in promoting a scheme such as this.<\/p> <p>It is our aim that steps are taken to secure the reuse of vacant and underutilised properties for residential purposes, particularly in the many towns and villages in rural Ireland that contain a significant number of empty houses.  Action 5.1 of the action plan relates to the development of a national vacant housing reuse strategy.  The strategy will examine the potential for bringing existing but vacant housing back into beneficial use.  I intend to examine mechanisms to match such accommodation potential to prospective applicants for social housing, through measures such as the repair and leasing initiative, which will see upfront financial assistance being made available to upgrade empty but substandard accommodation in return for leasing back the property for social housing purposes.  We also intend to examine the potential to widen the geographical range of social housing location options available to persons seeking such accommodation.  This ties in with what the Senator said.  Perhaps people on a waiting list in Dublin would be happy to relocate to a vacant property in Roscommon, Leitrim or Clare.  This would benefit the local community because it would create activity for shops, schools and transport.  Everybody would gain, provided it is by choice.  We will try to make this an option to make it happen.<\/p> <p>Acquisition and leasing options are also available to local authorities to ensure that households needing accommodation may be provided with such accommodation.  Rural Resettlement Ireland, RRI, mentioned by Senator Conway, has done a great job.  Recently, Mr. Jim Connolly of RRI met departmental officials to speak about the history of the organisation and its recent work and to be part of policy-making on rural regeneration and housing.  We had a successful meeting and more meetings are planned.  We recognise his expertise in this area and what the organisation has achieved over the years.  RRI was established in 1991 to encourage and assist families to relocate to depopulated rural areas.  In 1993 it received approved housing body status under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 and over the years since then it has received capital funding of more than &euro;5.81 million under the capital assistance scheme and the capital loan and subsidy scheme.  This capital funding was used to accommodate 21 households in County Clare and households in other areas.  In addition, RRI received a total of &euro;1.26 million in grant aid, of which the most recent instalment of &euro;10,000 was paid in 2012, towards administrative support for the provision of advice, research, training and other supports in its endeavours to assist families to relocate to depopulated rural areas.  Recently I watched an episode of \"Nationwide\" which featured some of these families.  It was clear they had a very successful outcome.  This was because of the work put in and the support and research provided.  It is a big move for anyone to leave a city with which they are familiar, such as Dublin or Cork, and move to a rural area.  Those of us familiar with rural Ireland understand how great it can be, but it can be a big change.  It is important work is done with the families.<\/p> <p>The Department&rsquo;s allocation for grant aid funding was significantly reduced in 2012, and grant in aid is now prioritised for those applicant organisations which contribute most significantly to meeting national housing objectives.  RRI was advised on receipt of its grant of &euro;10,000 in 2012 that, given resource constraints, it was unlikely the Department would be in a position to provide further funding to it under that scheme.  However, to guarantee that the rental properties supported by RRI are sustainably managed and maintained, fees for the management and maintenance of capital loan and subsidy scheme supported properties continue to be available to it, subject to compliance with the relevant terms and conditions.  These fees, together with loan and interest charges, amounted to more than &euro;696,000 over the past five years.<\/p> <p>I assure the House the Government is committed to ensuring that rural towns and villages are not forgotten in our ongoing implementation of Rebuilding Ireland.  The development of a rural resettlement programme will be considered further, in conjunction with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, in the context of taking forward these measures, the details of which are set out in the action plan.  We are committed to this.  It is something that makes total sense.  If 100, 200 or 1,000 people who today are in emergency accommodation and on a waiting list would like to move to a rural area we should facilitate it, particularly when there are vacant properties in the high streets of towns and villages which need to be used.  It would breathe some life back into these rural areas and give them a chance to maintain the services they have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#D00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for endorsing the ethos of the case I have made.

There is a chance that in an effort to solve some of the housing situation with the housing budget we can fund rural regeneration.  It makes sense that if people want to relocate that we would facilitate it at the very least.<\/p> <p>Jim Connolly understands the necessity of rural regeneration, which includes housing.  I chair an urban renewal working group, which includes small villages and towns, and we are examining a range of plans to breathe some life back into rural areas which have suffered decline not only for the past seven or eight years but perhaps for 20 or 30 years.  If we look at the Westport example, where over 20 years there was investment of more than &euro;180 million in a logical and planned way, we can see the difference it has made in those 20 years.  We need the same type of plans for other rural areas and villages throughout the country.  This is what we are trying to do through the Department, the working group I chair, and the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, to drive the action plan.  We are working with the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, and other Departments to address this and put in place long-term sustainable plans to rebuild rural areas.

Sub-aqua clubs engaged in underwater search and recovery provide a vital service at a time of great heartbreak for many people.  Much of their work focuses on cases where the time for a rescue has passed and the focus is on recovery of a deceased person in order that a body can be returned to a family.<\/p> <p>By its very nature, search and recovery is very costly.  Equipment required for search and recovery operations needs to be of a high quality and durable and includes diving suits, diving communication units, other technologies, boats and the cost of training, all of which are extremely expensive.  This equipment is currently being funded by clubs across the country through voluntary contributions. <\/p> <p>I recently met members of the Roscommon Sub Aqua Club which is one example of a sub-aqua club in real need of funding and support.  It is one of the largest in the new affiliated grouping in the midlands, with 14 fully-registered divers to support the Irish Coast Guard.  Each diver has to be in the water regularly in order to ensure their bodies are conditioned for deep sea diving and to meet standards required to engage in search and recovery operations.<\/p> <p>Members of the club have told me that, for example, their boat has to be on the water every week in order to support training and search and recovery operations.  The club currently has a 13 year old boat which is completely unsuitable for the work it carries out.  I have been told it is not fit for purpose.  A new rescue boat would cost approximately &euro;70,000, which the voluntary club simply cannot afford.  However, it is a cost that needs to be met in order to further support the vital work carried out by club and others across the country.  <\/p> <p>In the past three months alone, the club has been involved in three separate search and recovery operations.  One recent incident involved a number of people who got into difficulties while out on water in rough conditions.  The Roscommon Sub Aqua Club was called in and was involved in a recovery operation which lasted approximately 20 days.  The cost of this operation amounted to &euro;100 per hour in fuel costs alone.<\/p> <p>It is clear that the operations in which it is involved are extremely costly, yet the service provided is invaluable and priceless for the families affected.  Roscommon Sub Aqua Club and other clubs need to be supported by the Government.  Page 52 of A Programme for a Partnership Government states: \"We recognise the need for a grant aid scheme for underwater search and recovery, in line with the state support currently available to mountain search and rescue.\" <\/p> <p>The members of the Roscommon Sub Aqua Club and others across the country are very committed and carry out their work to a very high standard.  They carry out very important work which involves very high risk.  The value of the service to families to be underestimated.<\/p> <p>A situation where clubs like Roscommon Sub Aqua Club have to spend a significant amount of their time fundraising to support vital operations means they cannot be where they need to be, namely, effective in terms of supporting the Irish Coast Guard.  Therefore, I call on the Minister of State to provide an update on plans to introduce the grant aid scheme for underwater search and recovery, in line with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government.<\/p> <p>Following discussions with various Departments over the past number of months, I am aware this issue is within the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.  I also ask that the Minister of State make the Minister, Deputy Ross, very aware of the demands currently being placed on Roscommon Sub Aqua Club and others right across the country and to support the vital work they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#E00200","speaker":"1415"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Hopkins for raising this very important Commencement matter with regard to Roscommon Sub Aqua Club and other clubs all over the country, and the great work they do.  I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport. Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.<\/p> <p>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has recently been assigned responsibility for this matter under A Programme for a Partnership Government.  I would like to take this opportunity to clarify the Department&rsquo;s role in regard to search and rescue.  The Irish Coast Guard, as a division of the Department, has the delegated responsibility for maritime search and rescue.  The Irish Coast Guard provides maritime search and rescue through its three rescue co-ordination centres and dedicated search and rescue units.<\/p> <p>These search and rescue units comprise the search and rescue helicopters and Coast Guard volunteer units.  Search and rescue units are also declared to the Coast Guard from the RNLI with which the Coast Guard has a very close working relationship.<\/p> <p>As is recommended practice worldwide, search and rescue in Ireland is built upon the rescue centres listening for and receiving distress messages and responding to, sending and co-ordinating search and rescue units to the scene of an incident.  The Coast Guard uses the search and rescue helicopters, Coast Guard volunteer units and RNLI lifeboats to respond to vessels or persons in distress at sea.<\/p> <p>The network of search and rescue units has been built up over many years and today provides a first-class response to persons and vessels in distress.  The location, distribution and response services provided with these resources are kept under review, with a view to development and improvement in the delivery of search and rescue services.  In addition, the Coast Guard engages and co-operates with neighbouring states as part of the global search and rescue system.  The Coast Guard volunteers, search and rescue helicopters, rescue co-ordination centres and full-time Coast Guard staff are managed and funded on foot of the Department's responsibility to provide and support search and rescue services in line with Ireland&rsquo;s international commitment.  <\/p> <p>Turning specifically to the matter of underwater search and rescue, I should state that due to the very recent assignment of responsibility to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport I understand there has not been an opportunity for any in-depth analysis to take place.  On initial examination of the matter, it should be pointed out that to draw a comparison between underwater search and rescue and mountain rescue is not quite as simplistic as may appear.   <\/p> <p>Mountain rescue is carried out by dedicated mountain rescue teams who are declared resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to aid in the search for missing persons, in addition to assisting those who get into difficulty on our hills and mountains.  There is a systematic procedure involved for their tasking and there is no other entity in the State directly tasked with this responsibility.  Mountain rescue teams are charitable organisations run by volunteers.  They are in receipt of modest grants from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which do not purport to cover all costs associated with the running of the teams.  <\/p> <p>The Department does not exercise any operational oversight over mountain rescue teams due to the fact that they are search and rescue resources and are tasked directly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Responsibility for the recovery of bodies underwater rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the dedicated Garda water unit.  The Garda authorities may request the assistance of Irish Naval Service divers.  They may also seek the support of the Coast Guard, including the helicopter service, full-time Coast Guard staff and volunteers.  The Coast Guard does not undertake diving activities.  If necessary, specialist commercial diving resources may also be deployed.  <\/p> <p>These arrangements reflect the inherent risks involved in this type of activity.  The Coast Guard, when acting in support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in underwater recovery, does not as a general rule, request or avail of the assistance of divers who turn up at the scene of a maritime incident as a result of media coverage.  In fact, in 2016 the Coast Guard entered into an agreement with the Irish Underwater Council, the national governing body for recreational underwater sports, in order to clarify that the responsibility to manage such club divers rests with the Irish Underwater Council.  <\/p> <p>In light of the above, and specifically the recreational aspect, it is important that this matter is thoroughly analysed and researched, in particular the relationship to the health and safety diving regulations and recreational divers, with a view to investigating fully the provision of funding to entities which the Department would not generally task with undertaking search and recovery on behalf of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#E00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I very much appreciate the Minister of State's response on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.

It is stated: \"On initial examination of the matter, it should be pointed out that to draw a comparison between underwater search and recovery and mountain rescue is not quite as simplistic a similarity as it may appear.\"  However, this falls within A Programme for a Partnership Government.  We are talking about affiliated volunteers who complete training to meet standards to engage in search and recovery operations throughout the country.  They need equipment to support these operations, but it is very costly.  They need to be supported properly.  They are committed individuals who, in co-operation with the Irish Coast Guard, wish to engage heavily in whatever operation they are called on to participate.  I cannot accept the reply provided.  Following a more in-depth examination of the matter by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I ask that we receive a proper update on plans to introduce a grant aid scheme.

To be fair, he states he has only recently been assigned responsibility for this area in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  As I noted, the Irish Coast Guard has a suite of options to which it will resort in the event that it is called on to support underwater recovery activities.  In the first instance, such activities are the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which has its own diving team.  Second, the Naval Service can be requested to act in aid of the civil power using its own diving teams and equipment.  Additionally, if circumstances so require, commercial diving companies can be engaged and specialised equipment such as remotely operated underwater vehicles sourced.  In some circumstances, it might be the case that the assistance of private citizens or recreational divers who are members of diving clubs might be availed of.  However, because of the inherent risks to which I have referred, such assistance must, of necessity, be limited.  These activities must be undertaken by properly trained and equipped professionals under appropriate supervision such as members of Naval Service or Garda diving teams.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge that some of the equipment used is costly and that the people mentioned are volunteers.  Perhaps the Senator might request permission for a delegation to meet the Minister or his officials or she might write to the Chairman of the Oireachtas committee to ask that the matter be discussed.  The committee could invite representatives of local or national sub-aqua teams to attend a meeting to engage in a more detailed discussion when it might be possible to achieve all-party consensus on the matter.  I was involved in securing a once-off grant for capital infrastructure from the Department under the then Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for replacement of mountain rescue vehicles.

The House has had a number of statements from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and those statements have continued to be at variance with previous statements.  He has now stated that he is supporting the application for a presidential decree under Law 140 whereas in July 2015 he said the position in relation to the conviction and retrial of Peter Greste, which was the precedent we were using for the application of Law 140, would not apply in the case of Ibrahim Halawa.  He said the presidential decree and its terms would not be applied where an individual was in the course of a court process.  That was the Minister for Foreign Affairs in July 2015 and that is what he told the House.  He said the Government could not interfere or ask for the application of Law 140 and a presidential decree until after the court case but he has now changed his position again.  It demonstrates the lack of engagement and concern on the details of this issue.<\/p> <p>The Australian Government succeeded in getting Peter Greste released by forcefully looking for a presidential pardon and getting it, but it was only because it asked and made every diplomatic effort possible.  Ibrahim Halawa's case has been postponed for the 17th time and he now faces trial again.  He addressed the court and the judges for ten minutes yesterday.  Even though there are 400 defendants, he was allowed to address the court.  Amnesty International has said he is a prisoner of conscience and innocent of all charges, yet an Irish citizen is about to enter his fourth year in prison without trial.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to raise with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, the issue of rent certainty.  One fifth of the population is now renting houses.  Rents have increased in some areas by 40% to 50% and those people who are renting now have no opportunity to buy because it is virtually impossible to save the money for a deposit while paying rent.  We are concerned that the Government is only concerned about Galway and Dublin.  It is talking about designating other areas as zones of rent certainty in the future.  While we have a debate over the issue of 4%, an immediate issue is what happens in Greystones, Ashbourne and the rest of the commuter belt as soon as one puts rent certainty into Dublin.  Those areas will have no rent certainty.  In Galway, Waterford, Limerick and other towns and cities, rents have been increasing but there seems to be no proposal in relation to them.  In towns and villages around Ireland, there has been a huge increase in rents over the last number of years and to simply put a cap on rental increases is not the solution.<\/p> <p>In Kerry, and other areas, there are thousands of vacant houses which are not being refurbished and rented out by their owners because it simply would not pay them to do it.  That is not to mention the fact that trying to get the money to do it in the first place would be difficult.  There are thousands of houses that would become available if the Government implemented initiatives that would incentivise landlords who have houses but will not rent them out because it would not pay them to do so.  We have concerns about the Government's proposals and we look forward to the debate on the issue when it comes before the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#G00300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I echo some of the sentiments which were just expressed by Senator Mark Daly on the housing crisis and the Government's response to it.

On reading the report, it is clear that the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skill, Deputy John Halligan, has not listened to those who raised concerns in respect of the operation of the scheme.  Almost 7,000 children throughout the State have applied for school transport but were refused a seat despite claims from the Minister of State that no child would be without one.  In County Mayo alone, 497 concessionary primary tickets and 589 post-primary tickets were issued.  There were 289 requests for a concessionary ticket that were refused.  In fact, a number of people paid for the tickets but still did not get them.<\/p><p>That this review proposes retaining the <i>status quo<\/i>is unacceptable and does not take into account the reality on the ground.  The policy changes, which in all fairness were imposed by Fianna F&aacute;il, do not take account of the traditional catchment areas, health and safety concerns and community links.  Areas such as Ballycroy and Louisburgh in County Mayo have been deeply affected by these changes.

Rent certainty would be the best Christmas gift the Government could give to the thousands of people who are at risk of losing their homes because of rising rents.  The homelessness situation is at an all-time high and the solution of limiting rent increases to 4% per year will only exacerbate the problem.<\/p> <p>I personally know of two instances in the past two weeks where people are being forced to vacate their homes because of rent increases.  A friend of mine living in Bray had his rent increased from &euro;1,500 per month to &euro;1,900 per month.  As a result, he had to leave his home and has moved to his parents' family home.  My niece has also had her rent increased, from &euro;1,100 to &euro;1,700 per month, and has to move out, but she cannot find alternative accommodation in Dublin.  These exorbitant rent increases will make more people homeless and are totally unjustifiable.<\/p> <p>If people in rented accommodation at the moment are unable to pay their rent, how can a policy of allowing landlords increase rent by 4% per year help the situation?  The Peter McVerry Trust stated that rents will rise from the present monthly average of &euro;1,545 to a monthly average of &euro;1,737 in three years.  Inflation is at 0.5% at present so what is happening is that landlords are being allowed to increase their profits while more and more people are becoming homeless. <\/p> <p>The definition of insanity is to think that if we keep the landlords happy the market will provide.  I, for one, am shocked that the Government thinks that rent predictability is better than rent affordability.  I have a question for the Leader.  Are the profits of landlords more important to the Government than the need for affordable accommodation for families or is it that the Government is not in touch with the people of this country?  Can it not see what is happening?  Whole communities are being devastated by increasing rents and it is time to tackle this problem and show the people of this country that we care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#H00800","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>The programme for Government of May 2016 provides:<\/p><blockquote>The new Government understands the divisions and distress caused in local communities who feel that new energy infrastructure, like wind farms and pylons are imposed on them.

I ask that the Minister with responsibility, Deputy Naughten, outline in the House his plan to introduce new guidelines.

The United Nations said this morning that the al-Assad regime, with the support of the Russians, is responsible for the complete meltdown of humanity.  They are executing civilians and rebels and going from door to door to do this.  The Irish Government needs to do what it can to put immediate pressure on the regime to allow a proper ceasefire, not the ceasefire that was supposed to have occurred last night.  This would allow people to get out.<\/p> <p>This leads to my next point, about which I feel very strongly.  Refugees coming to this country need to be housed.  Documentation on the Government's Irish refugee protection programme states that in Westmeath, for example, there will be up to 30 families resettled in the new year.  The families will be split between Mullingar and Athlone.  I welcome this although we are under severe pressure owing to our own housing crisis.  I welcome the fact that there will be 30 families coming to Westmeath to be resettled.  However, I am concerned about where they will be settled.  Westmeath County Council has responsibility to house the families but there are already 2,200 people on the housing list.  Therefore, it is a big job for the council.  I am concerned about where the people will be housed.<\/p> <p>The Minister responsible, be it the Minister for Justice and Equality, who has responsibility for bringing the refugees in, or the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, needs to come to the Chamber to hear how Senators believe people should be housed.

There is an asylum unit in Athlone where families have been living for over ten years in mobile homes.

It states the company cannot guarantee any set working hours for staff.  That is how the private nursing home industry operates.  It is a standard contract.  I know this because I worked on trying to organise the workers.  There is considerable fear.  If the staff told their employers they were members of a trade union, they would not get any hours the following week.  That is the reality of how private nursing homes operate in this sector.  The workers get paid the princely sum of &euro;9.58 per hour, including a 3.5% premium for working nights and Sundays.  That industry is nothing less than a disgrace.  Let us have the debates and call in the Minister for Health.  We will make sure we have trade unionists in the Visitors Gallery to hear exactly what is going on in the sector.  Let us have no more lobbying on behalf of Nursing Homes Ireland.  It refuses to engage with the real issues in the industry and, as we all know, it refuses to engage with trade unions.

It is disappointing to note that the trial has been postponed again.  A few things in his analysis, such as on the lack of intervention by Government, need to be clarified.  On 12 November, and again on 17 November, the Taoiseach wrote to the President of Egypt urging him to return our citizen to Ireland without delay.  On 12 November he spoke to the Egyptian ambassador and expressed concern about the delay.  He also underlined the Government's strong desire for him to be returned to Ireland as a matter of urgency.  In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to liaise with the family and the embassy in Cairo and it maintains close and ongoing communications with lawyers in Egypt.  In the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach has expressed his frustration and annoyance at the constant adjournments and delays in the trial.  The Irish Government, though the Taoiseach, has been in direct contact with President el-Sisi on numerous occasions and the two men have met face to face to discuss the case on two occasions, as well as speaking on the telephone.

It is important to recognise that between now and then there needs to be much discussion between all sides in regard to the Bill.  I am sure all Members have a view and the Minister will be ready to work with everyone to ensure the Bill that returns to the House is the best it possibly can be.  The Bill is important.  It is somewhat cheap to say the new provisions are about landlords or about protecting certain people.  They are not.  Rather, they are about creating certainty, security, ensuring we have supply and standards and that the Residential Tenancies Board is beefed up to ensure tenants' rights are protected.<\/p><p>None of us in politics wants to see people without houses or sleeping on the streets or in hotel rooms.  All of us want people to be provided with housing, whether through the rental market or social or private housing.  The language used on all sides of the House is important.  Nobody flies a flag for any particular band of sectoral interests.  This is all about people who require housing.<\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh once again questioned my understanding of economics, but that is okay.  We will have a debate on the school transport scheme and the relevant Minister can come to the House, once she understands that the Sinn F&eacute;in history of high taxes and spending is the bedrock of where she comes from.<\/p><p>Senator Landy raised the very important issue of wind farms and matters before the courts.  I would be happy for the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to come before the House in the new year to discuss the matter.<\/p><p>Senators McFadden, Butler and Lombard referred to Syria.  It is fair to say we are all appalled at the lack of leadership in regard what is happening.  George Osborne summed it up well yesterday when he spoke about a vacuum of leadership.  We have not had the leadership we need in order to bring a resolution to the region.  We all stand united in the condemnation of the attacks by the al-Assad regime and its allies.  It is time the international community joined together to ensure that the barbaric behaviour comes to an end.  There is no justification for this type of behaviour, good bad or indifferent.  We have seen images of defenceless people being killed in their homeland.  We need to see an end to the targeted attacks.  That requires international leaders to stand up and be counted.  I hope the Minister will do that on behalf of the Irish Government.<\/p><p>Senators Gavan and Colm Burke referred to private nursing homes.  I will not go into that issue today, as it was discussed yesterday, but I would be happy for the relevant Minister to come to the house to deal with the matter.  Senator Richmond made a proposal regarding the visits of Heads of State and Government.  It is a very worthwhile proposal that should be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I will be happy to have that discussion with the committee, through the good offices of the Cathaoirleach.<\/p><p>Senator Davitt referred to housing in Westmeath on which I would be happy to have a discussion.  He could also table a Commencement Matter on the issue.  Senator Humphreys referred to Airbnb, separate from to the rental strategy.  The Minister spoke on the radio about the matter.  The Senator has raised a very good point that needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to University Hospital Galway.  I would be happy for the Minister to address the issue.  He cannot table a Commencement Matter on the issue before Christmas because the Minister will be unable to come to the House before the Christmas holidays.

We had lengthy debates on Second and Committee Stages and many issues have been ironed out.  The general thrust of the legislation is to look at making work pay, which is about reducing the USC.  The Bill includes a range of other measures.  The Minister of State has given a commitment he will review various aspects of the Bill over time.  An issue that has been raised is with regard to regulation where vulture funds purchase home loans and small business loans.  This may be outside the scope of the Finance Bill, but is relevant.<\/p> <p>Last week, the Central Bank appeared before the finance committee and it has concerns about this area.  Where a home loan or a small business loan is purchased by a vulture fund which does not operate in Ireland, regulation is under the auspices of an intermediary appointed by the vulture fund.  There is concern that policy and interest rates are dictated by the vulture funds.  Will the Minister of State examine how this operates in practice?  The voluntary code was to apply to the funds.  Will the Central Bank have sufficient teeth under the regulations to ensure home owners remain in the same position as they would have been if the loan had been held by the original Irish-based institution?  We need to keep a very close eye on how this operates in practice.  We cannot have a situation whereby home owners whose loans are sold to vulture funds are put under enormous pressure.  When the Central Bank steps in to regulate the intermediary administering the loan it finds it does not have sufficient teeth to deal with it.  People are being dealt with in different ways depending on whether they are with the original bank or the vulture fund.<\/p> <p>Small business loans may also be sold to vulture funds by banks operating in Ireland.  These small businesses suddenly find they are put to the pin of their collar.  When the Central Bank steps in it finds it does not have sufficient teeth to deal with the situation.  I ask that a review be carried out under the legislation introduced recently to govern how loans sold to vulture funds are regulated.  If there is a need to do so, the Government should step in so that the Central Bank has sufficient powers to ensure that anyone whose loan is sold to a vulture fund by one of the principal banks is not put in a worse position.<\/p> <p>This is a general observation on the regulation of foreign institutions, colloquially known as vulture funds, buying loans from Irish institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#P00600","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I have said all I want to say about the Bill in the previous debates.  It is short-sighted.  It is very obvious thousands of home owners are in the situation outlined by Senator O'Donnell with regard to vulture funds.  The Central Bank has done absolutely nothing regarding the packages of non-performing loans being sold off to these vulture funds, which are completely unregulated and can charge whatever interest they want.  There is no urgency about fixing this.  This is why legislation needs to be introduced immediately.  The Central Bank needs to play a much more robust role under its consumer protection remit.  The Minister should be doing everything he can to facilitate it doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#P00700","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>This year we have brought about a reformed budget and finance scrutiny process which has been very beneficial.

The most recent estimates available suggest the horse and greyhound racing industries combined underpin in excess of 24,000 jobs and stimulate economic output of approximately &euro;1.6 billion.  They receive financial support from the State through the horse and greyhound racing fund under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  My Department makes payments from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  In the period 2002 to date a total of &euro;1.03 billion has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund, provided for under the relevant regulations, has, therefore, been reached.  <\/p> <p>Exchequer funding provided from the fund is pivotal to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.  To give effect to the budget for 2016, the cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulations.  The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of the budgetary process for 2017, include an allocation of &euro;80 million for the horse and greyhound racing fund.  It will be distributed in accordance with section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, with 80% going to Horse Racing Ireland and 20% to Bord na gCon.  These percentages amount to &euro;64 million and &euro;16 million, respectively.  To allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2017, it is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 to increase the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the horse and greyhound racing fund by &euro;80 million to &euro;1.118 billion.  This is being achieved by way of the regulations submitted today.  The aggregate limit on the horse and greyhound racing fund was increased in this manner in 2004, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.  <\/p> <p>With regard to the horse racing industry, it is estimated that the bloodstock industry provides 14,000 jobs and contributes almost &euro;1.1 billion to the economy.  In 2015 bloodstock export sales rose to &euro;268 million in what was a remarkable year for the bloodstock industry.  The industry is also estimated to account for up to 80,000 tourists to Ireland each year.  They are among the estimated 1 million plus who attend horse racing each year in the country.  Ireland holds a distinguished position in the thoroughbred racing world, being the biggest producer of thoroughbred foals in Europe and the fourth biggest in the world.  Approximately 40% of the EU output of thoroughbreds and 11% of the total worldwide are produced in Ireland.  The horse and greyhound racing fund has been pivotal in shaping the destiny of this dynamic industry.  It has helped Ireland to become a world centre of excellence for horse racing and allowed Horse Racing Ireland to undertake a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.<\/p> <p>The horse racing industry satisfies all of the critical requirements for success in terms of employment and foreign direct investment.  It is the type of export-oriented industry we need.  The industry has been the flagship for the country and had an immeasurable influence on its international reputation in recent times.  Government funding of this key industry presents an excellent opportunity to yield a high return on investment.  Support for certain strategic industries is important to future economic growth and can provide widespread benefits for society, in addition to the economy.<\/p> <p>With regard to the greyhound industry, the greyhound racing sector is also an important driver of employment and activity in both rural and urban areas.  A report by Jim Power Economics in 2010 estimated that the greyhound industry employed over 10,300 people and contributed almost &euro;500 million in economic output to local economies around tracks, which have a wide geographical spread.  Bord na gCon reports that, since 2002, over 10 million people have attended greyhound race meetings.  The board has an annual turnover of approximately &euro;40 million.  Funds generated from racing are reinvested in the industry through contributions to prize money and grants to various bodies involved in the greyhound racing and breeding sector, in addition to the promotion of greyhound welfare and the regulation of the industry.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Andrew Doyle:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The challenge for the board is to encourage the development of a commercial greyhound racing and breeding industry built on a consumer-focused, high-quality entertainment product which meets the highest international regulatory standards.  The funding being provided to the greyhound racing sector helps to sustain a long-standing tradition as the industry is part of the social fabric of the country and underpins economic activity in what are often less affluent regions.  It has also contributed significantly to the improved facilities available at greyhound tracks around Ireland.  Greyhound racing as an activity is inextricably linked to the farming community and, while it is undoubtedly part of the fabric of rural Ireland, it also enjoys a strong urban support base.  The overall objective of the Government is to ensure that the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve their maximum potential and, in so doing, contribute to economic and social development.  Governments of all persuasions have acknowledged the importance of these industries and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives over a long period.  Without this support, these vital industries would simply not survive.<\/p><p>Broadening the tax base is an issue that has been of significant concern among many politicians, in particular.  The advent of new technologies and business models has challenged Government to re-evaluate the funding mechanisms for the industry.  As part of its overall commitment to the industry, the Government has addressed, through legislation, the anomaly whereby remote and online betting operators were outside the tax net.  The Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 came into force in April 2015 and brings betting exchanges and Internet and mobile betting providers within the scope of the existing licensing regime.  It extends the existing 1% turnover tax on land-based bookmakers' activities to online and mobile bookmakers and implements a 15% commission tax for betting exchanges.  These measures have had a very positive effect on revenue streams with significant increases being realised.  Betting tax revenues have increased by &euro;20 million in 2016 when compared with this time last year.<\/p><p>Both Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon have operated through challenging economic conditions over the past several years and, in that context, the former Minster for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, had the activities and operation of both bodies reviewed.  The Horse Racing Ireland Act, which gives effect to the recommendations in the Indecon report, came into force on 8 February 2016 with certain sections commenced on 9 March 2016 and further sections due to commence in January 2017.  The Act introduced a range of improvements in governance and accountability arrangements, many of which derive from recommendations made by Indecon consultants following their review of the sector.  Indecon International Economic Consultants was also commissioned to conduct a review of certain matters relating to Bord na gCon in order to assess the suitability of the legal, governance and regulatory framework supporting the greyhound industry and to identify opportunities to maximise its commercial income.  In this regard, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Creed, will shortly bring forward the heads of a greyhound industry Bill to ensure the principles of good governance and regulation are clearly and unambiguously laid down in primary legislation.  In broad terms, the Bill will seek to address the deficiencies in the existing legislation as identified in a report authored by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in January 2016, as well as in the Indecon and Morris reports.  The Bill addresses the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthens regulatory controls in the industry, modernises sanctions and improves integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector.  The Bill will strengthen the Irish greyhound industry, enable it to deal with the existing challenges and maximise its future potential.<\/p><p>Without doubt, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon face significant challenges as they work to grow and develop the horse and greyhound industries in an extremely competitive market segment.  I am, nonetheless, confident that these industries have tremendous growth potential with sporting, leisure, tourism and cultural appeal across a wide demographic, both national and international.  The thoroughbred horse industry is a major driver in the economy and both industries breathe life and jobs into their respective communities from the grassroots up.  The &euro;80 million allocation is vital to help secure rural jobs and sustain communities.  The Government plays an important role in considering policy and providing an input into legislation to nurture all potential growth.  Given that these two industries have their respective footprints in many parts of rural Ireland, I am confident that it is the goal of all of Members present to fully realise the contribution of these sectors to the economy, employment and the social and cultural fabric of this country.<\/p><p>The degree of success of these initiatives is dependent on the hugely important contribution made by the horse and greyhound racing fund.  Section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 provides that a draft of these regulations must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft be passed by each House before the regulations are made by the Minister.  Accordingly, I ask for Members' support to ensure that Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon receive the funding provided for in budget 2017 and that the very important role of these industries and the economic activity generated by them are sustained into the future.  I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#Z00300","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I ask all Members to be brief.

My party will support the motion on the horse and greyhound racing fund.  As the Minister of State rightly pointed out, Ireland is a world leader in this industry, which is what this is.  While there is often a false perception about and an opposition to the allocation of such funds to what is perceived in the general domain to be a glorified sport, the Minister of State has pointed out with reference to the facts and figures that this is a major industry, particularly in parts of rural Ireland where neither industry nor employment are ten a penny.<\/p> <p>There is an old adage which states that to accumulate, one must speculate.  The fund makes an investment of &euro;80 million in the sector with &euro;64 million for the horse racing industry and &euro;16 million for the greyhound racing industry at an 80:20 breakup.  With that money, we are supporting an industry with an annual economic output of &euro;1.6 billion according to the latest figures.  In any man's language, it is a good reward for any investment.  In this case, it helps to provide employment for up to 24,000 in rural areas.  I ask those who think the investment should not be made whether they would prefer if the money had to be spent to fund social welfare payments to compensate those people if their jobs did not exist.<\/p> <p>Racing plays a major role in our tourism industry with an estimated 80,000 tourists coming to the island annually with the primary goal of attending racing festivals.  Those racing festivals also make a major contribution to their respective local economies with an estimated &euro;260 million being spent annually in the likes of Killarney, Galway and elsewhere.  The investment is reaping enormous rewards.  The argument will be made that the horse racing industry would survive without this money.  While that is possibly true, without this injection, our national industry would be an also-ran.  By virtue of the stimulus and support provided by the fund, we are world leaders in this industry with Irish exports of bloodstock at &euro;268 million.  That is a serious input into our economy.<\/p> <p>I had a number of issues but the Leas-Chathaoirleach asked me to be brief.

It could be spent on such matters rather than dishing out huge prize money and building fancy bars.<\/p><p>Bord na gCon claims it contributes &euro;500 million to the economy while Horse Racing Ireland claims to contribute &euro;1.1 billion.  If they can claim these vast sums of money, how can we justify providing huge annual contributions to both industries which are dominated by very rich owners and trainers?  Our citizens - those lying on the streets and on hospital trolleys - deserve better.  The Government often talks about priorities; I know where my priority would be in this regard.  Corporate governance of both industries also raises questions as highlighted with the reappointment of CEOs against State rules and the building of champagne bars.  I have raised the matter of the reappointment of the CEO, as has my party.  My colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, raised it in the D&aacute;il and yet the reappointment stands despite its breaching rules and salary caps.

In these modern times when we have so many ways to stimulate activity into the economy and we have so many high-tech jobs and pharmaceutical jobs, it is fantastic that the tradition of horseracing and greyhound racing, which have been with us for centuries as part of our history, is to the fore allowing us to present ourselves on an international stage.  The figures the Minister of State has laid before us prove that we are making a success out of something that is dear to so many people's hearts.  There is much pride in our bloodstock that is in such demand considering the size of our country.  We can be proud that horses and jockeys from this country feature internationally.<\/p> <p>As has been said, Bord na gCon and Horse Racing Ireland have been funded every year since the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  This is a technicality in that the consent of the Houses is required for this &euro;80 million to be split 80:20 between Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  The evidence of the success of the investment is there.  The Irish thoroughbred industry report update from 2013 gives the figures the Minister of State outlined of &euro;1.6 billion in economic output and 24,000 jobs underpinned.  We know those jobs are in the horse breeding and dog breeding sectors.  In addition there are jobs in hospitality with 1 million people attending horseracing events with significant numbers also visiting our greyhound tracks.  People are getting entertainment and it supports the hospitality sector and international tourism; it is good all round.<\/p> <p>The area of corporate governance is very important.  When we are giving taxpayers' money it needs to be spent in line with what we envisage for it.  I am delighted that arising from the recommendation from the Indecon report we saw the Horse Racing Ireland Act come into law.

I would like to see the Government introduce a gambling control Bill which has been discussed for some time.

My party will support this funding.  I acknowledge the number of jobs that are created through the horse industry and greyhound industry.  While some people feel it is an opportunity for buying champagne in luxurious bars, as someone from a rural area, I recognise that it is an opportunity for people who may not get employment in their own areas to be employed.  I am surrounded by dog breeders, owners and trainers as well as horse breeders, owners and trainers in Tipperary.  Every day I see young people who have been able to stay and work in their own communities.  Some of them have broken out into training dogs or horses.  They have gainful employment, participate in their communities.  They are around to play GAA, soccer and other sports in their communities and make up teams.<\/p> <p>I do not live in a parallel universe.  I am surprised at our Sinn F&eacute;in colleague.  I am quite friendly with many Sinn F&eacute;in people who are involved in the dog industry and who are looking for the Bill the Minister of State mentioned and which I hope he will steer through.  The Minister of State referred to a report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine last January.  The Minister of State, as Chairman of that committee, guided that through the committee during 2015, when I also sat on the committee.<\/p> <p>I do not pretend there are no problems in the greyhound industry; there are many problems there.  There are problems with governance, integrity, substance misuse, semen control and stud control as well as many other problems.  The report broadcast over four or five days on RTE's \"Drive Time\" programme highlighted the problems.  Cutting of the supply of money to the people in the industry who are trying to tidy this up and make a proper living from it and bring integrity back will not solve these problems.  It will be done by introducing legislation as we intend to do.  I do not speak as a Government Member but as somebody from the Opposition who has an interest in this.  I have had many discussions with the Minister of State and I know he intends to do it.  We will have one opportunity to do it, starting immediately after Christmas.  We need to get this right because the industry is dying on its feet.  As I said on radio the other day, if we do not get it right and bring the confidence back into the industry, it will die.<\/p> <p>The horseracing industry had the same problems.  We need to remember that the people working in that industry are represented by associations, such as the Irish Stable Staff Association, Irish Injured Jockeys and the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association.  All those people have organisations within the horseracing business to stand up for them and to speak for them.  It is not as though people are downtrodden.  I have frequently raised the entitlement of members of the Irish Stable Staff Association to proper wages, etc., and that is moving along.  However, cutting off the supply of funding for the industry would not solve anything and would put more people on the dole.

Those are the facts.<\/p><p>As has been said, the industry has attracted 80,000 visitors from overseas, primarily for horse racing rather than greyhound racing.  It is considered a sport that brings in a lot of revenue.  The industry is thriving in some areas of the country.  It provides significant rural employment, and if there are issues around the conditions of some employees, that needs to be addressed under employment law.<\/p><p>Nobody would ever say that greyhound racing was an elitist activity; it is anything but.  The demographic spread of greyhound owners and breeders shows that people do not need to have a large amount of money or resources at their disposal.  They require resources to transport and keep animals to a certain standard on registered premises.  It is quite simple.  The new legislation will deal with governance, regulation, integrity and improving the reputation of the sector.  Other legislation concerning animal health and welfare is already in place, which can deal with many of the alleged and perceived problems that exist in the sector.<\/p><p>It is important that we examine the &euro;80 million that will be allocated under the horse and greyhound racing fund and the revenue that is generated.  More important than that is how we can fine tune and develop other aspects of the sector.  <\/p><p>I agree entirely with Senator Mulherin about the gambling control Bill.  I have been an advocate for it since it was first introduced by the former Minister, Alan Shatter, as a White Paper.  The betting tax Bill will provide us with an opportunity to increase betting tax as long as we can capture it and not put some indigenous people involved in the bookmaking industry at a disadvantage.  That is the trick. <\/p><p>Eventually, the net cost of the fund should be zero.  In other words, the revenue returned to the Exchequer through taxes such as betting tax would equate to the amount of money that is given out.  Money comes in to the Exchequer and is dished out through different Votes to various Departments.  That is what we are trying to do here today.  I appreciate that &euro;7 million would provide rural transport, but the industry is primed, through the &euro;80 million fund, to bring in revenue to the State to allow us to consider all of the other options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#BB00400","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1481711400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 30; N\u00edl, 8.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Gabrielle McFadden and Michelle Mulherin; N\u00edl, Senators Paul Gavan and Trevor \u00d3 Clochartaigh.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#CC00400","aye":["1409","1380","1423","1391","1384","1376","1420","1390","1414","1383","1411","1396","1415","1412","1417","1387","1393","1386","1375","1425","1398","1374","1397","1394","1431","1382","1410","1421","1399","1418"],"nay":["1378","1388","1389","1405","1400","1392","1413","1372"],"abs":[]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Bill 2016: Committee Stage","time":1481711400,"counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#DDDDD00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

However - I think this is what I think Senator Higgins is saying - if the Minister accepts the requirement to report to the Houses and she provides a report of some nature each year on the performance of the scheme, that would do the Minister some service, do the House some service and ensure the type of transparency the public demands on incentives such as this.  I fully support the scheme.<\/p> <p>As a Minister of State sitting at Cabinet, I was involved with the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, in helping to design this scheme.  While we should be proud of it, we should spend a little time considering the transparency element.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#KK01100","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I call Senator Mac Lochlainn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#KK01200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>May I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#KK01300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I will allow Senator Higgins speak after the Minister.

I will speak to amendments Nos. 7 and 8.  The rationale behind amendment No. 7 is that it seeks to delete the following section, which states that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring the controller to include information, the inclusion of which would in the opinion of the controller be likely to prejudice the performance of the controller's functions under this Act.  We believe that all records should be kept in the interests of accountability and transparency.<\/p> <p>The rationale behind amendment No. 8 is that it is in the interests of accountability and transparency to have not just the applications but the name of applicants so that one can see the consistent points.  I agree with much of what Senator Nash said.  For many years there have been calls to incentivise research and development and it is something we can do better on this island but we just need to make sure that the appropriate checks and balances are in place.<\/p> <p>With all respect to Senator Reilly, we know that tax incentives have been introduced, for example, one need only think of the oil and gas off the coast and some of the vulture capitalists who availed of opportunities in this city that have been closed down.  One must be very cautious about introducing incentives and make sure all the checks and balances are in place.  We must strike a balance between incentivising people to create jobs in the area of research and development but we must have the appropriate checks and balances in the public interest, considering the number of debacles we have had in this State in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#LL00100","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for tabling amendments Nos. 5 to 9, inclusive, to section 18, which are being taken together.  Section 18 requires the controller to report annually to the Minister on this scheme.  Amendment No. 5 in the name of Senator Mac Lochlainn seeks that the report by the controller is to the D&aacute;il instead of to the Minister.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 6 in the name of Senators Higgins and Ruane seeks to have the report made publicly available.  The annual report by the controller to the Minister will provide statistical information on the office's activity on the KDB scheme including, numbers of KDB applications filed, applications withdrawn, KDB certificates granted, refused or reviewed.  The process before the controller is one step in the process for a company to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for the 6.25% corporate tax rate.<\/p> <p>The fact that a company might be successful in getting a certificate from the office does not mean that the company will be successful in qualifying for the lower corporate tax rate when it applies to the Revenue Commissioners.  Given that the information contained in the report is limited and is part of a wider process, it is considered appropriate that the controller should report to the Minister as opposed to the D&aacute;il and for this information not to be publicly disclosed.  For that reason I do not accept amendments Nos. 5 and 6.<\/p> <p>In relation to amendment No. 7 in the name of Senator Mac Lochlainn, I should point out that the controller is an independent officeholder who acts under the superintendence and direction of the Minister.  The provision in section 18(2) is a necessary safeguard that allows the controller to undertake his or her statutory functions without undue and inappropriate interference by any Minister.  Senator Mac Lochlainn's amendment would undermine the independence of the controller in carrying out his or her statutory functions under the Bill.  The controller must be able to undertake this function without fear of interference.  For that reason, I am not accepting amendment No. 7.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 8 which is also in the name of Senator Mac Lochlainn seeks the inclusion of the name of applicants for the KDB scheme in the report to the Minister.  The names of applicants are not included in the controller&rsquo;s annual reports of his or her activities for the office covering patents, trade marks and designs.  Section 18 of the Bill follows this practice.  Moreover, as Senators will be aware, the Revenue Commissioners do not disclose the identity of taxpayers and indeed the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 prevents Revenue from releasing taxpayer information.  For that reason I am not accepting amendment No. 8.<\/p> <p>As regards amendment No. 9 in the name of Senators Higgins and Ruane it is the case that applications before the office will be examined individually on the basis of novelty, usefulness and non-obviousness.  In the case of refusals, the office will follow exactly the same process as it does now in relation to refusals of patents, trademarks or designs.  The reasons for refusal are case-specific and are not made publicly available and that is the intention also in this Bill.  For those reasons I am not accepting amendment No. 9.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#LL00200","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>In response to Senator Reilly, it is important to say we do not need to have a divisive conversation but we need to be honest.  It is straightforward; it is an expenditure.  The fact that if a company is paying 6.25% because of its research and development, if it was going to pay &euro;500,000 to the State it will now pay &euro;250,000.  It is just a straight expenditure and it may well be worth it.  I will not be painted as the enemy of research and innovation.  I am very passionate about research and innovation, including public research and innovation, which is another area we need to look at.  That is an area I have highlighted previously.  We need research and innovation from both the private and public sectors but we also need to make sure that we are getting appropriate value and that it is working out.<\/p> <p>The Senator described how we move from the large number of companies to the smaller number who are successful in an ever-decreasing pyramid.  I am very aware of that, but the bit that we tend to leave out, unfortunately, is the bit about what happens next - the small number that are successful, whom we have rightly supported at various steps of the way.  We must consider what then is the benefit to society and where is the wider benefit.  It is not simply enough to say some companies will succeed and we expect there will be jobs.  We are asking the Minister to track the process, to join the dots.  That approach relates to both my amendments.  There may have been a misunderstanding of amendment No. 9.  I have indicated already I will withdraw it and reserve the right to resubmit a variant of it on Report Stage.  However, the key concern is whether the Minister wants to get qualitative information as well as statistical information because otherwise I do not understand what information she will be getting that will allow her to evaluate the scheme.  I am just asking for that.  This is simply about information.  There is a separate point at which I hope the information would be publicly available.  Again, my amendment No. 10, which I will also withdraw and reserve the right to reintroduce or vary on Report Stage, is about a public report.

Just because a body is independent does not mean that it is not subject to accountability.  In this land, even if one goes as high as the Supreme Court and one loses one's case, one can consider going to the European Court of Justice.  There are courts of appeal.  Nobody is beyond reproach.  That is the case even with the Ombudsman.

The Bill is supported by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  I have made many efforts to bring forward the Bill but D&aacute;ileanna have collapsed and it is difficult to get Private Members' Bills passed.  We now have new politics and I am delighted with the new approach which will bring about results.  I received tremendous support from the late Brian Lenihan, the Minister's former constituency colleague, who worked with me on the Bill.  Even when he was not in the best of form he came along to see if he could get it through, but the Government at the time fell.  I thank the Leader of the House and the Fianna F&aacute;il Whip who arranged time for the Bill.<\/p> <p>The Bill provides an opportunity to register one of the most important documents a person can make, which is a will.  Most countries have such a system in place, and I believe Malta is the only country which does not.  In Ireland, we have 10,826 solicitors and 7,807 law firms.  A solicitor or a law firm can make a will, as can an individual, but the register of the will is kept in the solicitor's office.  In these circumstances, a will's book is held in a secure location in the offices of a legal firm.  Some legal firms have difficulties and go out of business, and there is a danger of the records being lost.<\/p> <p>Brexit is also causing issues because a number of UK based solicitors are registering with the Law Society of Ireland.  This means they can make wills here.  People are more transient now than in the past.  Someone could make a will in Cork and there may never be anything more about it.  Before coming to the House a few hours ago, I got a call from a man in Cork whose father transferred land to his two brothers, and while his mother left 46 acres of the farm to him, it was repossessed.  A law firm found his mother's will in its office.  He is very aggrieved.  His problem will not be solved by the will.  What would solve it is if records were kept by the General Register Office, which is located in Roscommon as it happens.<\/p> <p>I am trying to be brief and not make a big speech because I have rehearsed this quite a lot over the period and it is better to explain it in straightforward terms.  All I want is a voluntary registration of a will on an A4 sheet of paper stating when and where a will was made, where it is held, who made it and where it is available.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Terry Leyden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That information cannot be made available to any family member or inquisitive neighbour - the neighbour would not be allowed to see it, number one.  If a family member is deceased, the family gets the original death certificate and on production of that certificate, it will be informed by the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages that a will was made.  That is the kernel of this issue.  It is not rocket science.  Since the foundation of the State, we have had a register and licences for dogs or a television.  We register everything.  Roughly 30,000 people die every year and only about 10,000 cases go to probate.  If a will is found after probate takes place, and two very eminent solicitors are sitting on either side of me so I am certainly blessed, it is null and void.  My colleagues can confirm that but that is the procedure.  We have an excellent probate officer and probate service.  It is well organised and a great indication of very sophisticated administration in Ireland.  We have a quality Land Registry, probate services and registration of births, deaths and marriages.  These services are very important.  It is very important that the State can keep a record.  There are other organisations that have tried to set up these services but they come and go.  <br\/><br\/>I am very anxious that this be debated so that an awareness is created.  Having this debate in this House makes people aware that they should make a will.  It will not kill them.  Some people felt that if they made a will, they were on their last legs.  A will is vital.  If even a young couple with an apartment or house and children dies intestate, there is complete confusion about who is entitled to what, where and when.  Even the simplest things like family jewellery or cars can present a problem.  I must say that solicitors have been very helpful.  In October, they offered a special deal involving making a will.  This is one advantage of having this debate in this House.  Another is the opportunity to go through Committee Stage some time in the new year.  I spoke to an eminent senior counsel who was quite satisfied with the general gist of this Bill - the fact that there is no disclosure or breach of confidentiality and making a will is a voluntary decision so that there will be no compulsory wills.  If wills are made on a voluntary basis, there must be a voluntary code of practice.  I think my colleagues said that at the beginning of the debate.  One cannot bring in legislation saying that if a solicitor does not register a will, they could be prosecuted.  It is just not practical.  At this point in time, we want awareness.  If this Bill becomes law, I would like the legal firms to say that they will register everything they have at the start through some arrangement, such as getting a copy of the books into the offices and registering them.  It puts extra work on the Department, an office of which I am delighted to see in Roscommon town.  I looked at the probate office, which was not that suitable because it does not hold the Registry of Birth, Deaths and Marriages.  The key is to hold the Registry of Birth, Deaths and Marriages.  One can then ensure one will have knowledge regarding the will that is being made.  <br\/><br\/>I am sure that in his work as a Deputy, the Minister has come across issues like this over the years.  When I bring it up, I get some hard luck stories.  A man told me today that the prodigal sons were brought back and he was thrown out.  I do not know if that happened in biblical terms but he certainly felt very aggrieved.  This sparks off contact with people around the country because so many people have been deprived.  Is there anything worse than being deprived of a legitimate legacy from a father, uncle or brother?  We are talking about a simple will that says a person will inherit this property.  Would it not be awful if in ten years' time, they find the will but probate has already taken place?  That is the key.  Any Members present know that in old times in rural Ireland, there would be two or three solicitors' firms in a town.  When a person died, the solicitors would go to the funeral and ask the family to come in on Monday morning as they had some documents for family members to look at.  They would then gather together on Monday morning, settle up and that was it.  Now somebody could die in Galway with most deaths being broadcast on Shannonside, Midwest Radio or Northern Sound.  However, a solicitor is not listening to death notices every day to find out whether one of their clients has died.  The solicitor will not hear about it.  If you look at the <i>Law Society Gazette<\/i>, which I think comes out every month, you will find ten requests asking whether someone has knowledge of such a will, where it is and whether it can be found.  That does help locate those particular wills.  I do not want to labour this point because I have gone through it on a few occasions.  At the time, there was support across this House.  Former Senator Fergal Browne from Fine Gael, who was from Carlow, took a tremendous interest in it.  This was in the period from 2002 to 2007.  Senator Browne took a tremendous interest in the Bill and pushed it very hard.  In fact, he brought out another Bill later on that concerned pre-nuptial agreements.  I am not sure if it was successful.  This Bill aimed to ensure that when you go up with &euro;100, you do not come down with &euro;50.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#NN00300","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Or the other way around.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#OO00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":252,"content":"<p>You go up with &euro;100 and come down with &euro;200.

As Jack Lemmon once said, \"death ends a life, not a relationship\".  Certainly when there is a will, there are definitely relations.  When there is a will, there is certainly a way.  The Registration of Wills Bill will provide a clear statutory basis for the registration of wills by extending the civil registration system, which will enable the person making the will or their solicitor to register details of the custodian of their will, thus reducing the risks of wills remaining unknown or being found belatedly.

It is worth pointing out that the Bill would not go straight to the next Stage but would go to the committee and at that stage, Senator Leyden would have the opportunity for the Law Society of Ireland and other interest groups to make their input.  This version of the Registration of Wills Bill has been introduced twice previously by Senator Leyden in 2006 and 2011, and has been opposed on both occasions.  The Bill proposes making a voluntary register of wills, which in itself is a good idea and one which I support.  It is not a depository of wills to be administered by the General Register Office, GRO.  The register would contain details of the testator and custodian of the will.<\/p><p>The Bill was considered in detail in 2006 by the Department of Health and Children.  As Senator Leyden outlined, the then Minister of State, Brian Lenihan, met with him and went through the legal issues and his reasons for opposing the Bill at that time.  While the idea is a very good one in principle, we need to make sure that it is done properly.  I am supportive of the Bill going to the next Stage, and I hope the Minister will be also.<\/p><p>Senator Leyden was not listening when I made the point earlier that the Bill will go to committee, because that must happen, and at that stage, the Law Society of Ireland and other interested parties could make their input.  Some legitimate concerns exist that the Bill as currently formulated would not achieve any certainty about the existence of a valid will.  The right of a person to make a subsequent unregistered will or codicil remains.  Registration <i>per se<\/i>could not be used in evidence and could bring the GRO into disrepute.  Moreover, in 2006 the Bill was opposed by the Law Society of Ireland.  Furthermore, there are also issues about the parent Department or organisation, costs, staffing, training and systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#PP00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Surprise, surprise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#PP00500","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":262,"content":"<p>That is of concern.

I support the general principle of the Bill.<\/p> <p>The new section which was inserted in 2011 was to address the deficiencies brought to attention during the passage of the 2005 Bill through the Seanad.  However, it is difficult to see how the new provision addresses those concerns.  It merely underlines the deficiencies of the Bill.<\/p> <p>There would be no evidential basis for a register of wills, as proposed.

One could argue that any voluntary register should be managed by that office.

Also, since the proposed scheme, as currently set out, would be unlikely to have the support of the Law Society of Ireland, it is likely that a relatively small number of wills would be registered if solicitors do not buy into the process.  However, the crucial point has to be what the Bill would deliver for citizens.  Would this Bill provide certainty where people die, apparently intestate, where the existence of a will is disputed or where wills are apparently lost?

It is a very good idea that when a will is made that it would be registered without the contents of the will being in any way revealed.  I know Senator Leyden is not suggesting that, but the fact that a will exists should be registered.  That is right because it would prevent the will being lost and all the trauma the Senator described of a relative coming across a second will later.  The final will and testament of a person, if he or she is of fit mind and testamentary condition, if one likes, is the operative document, but the Bill does not suggest that is not the case.<\/p> <p>The purpose of the Bill is for wills to be registered.  It is administratively simple and efficacious.  It is the right thing to do and it will ensure wills do not go missing, avoid trauma and assist everyone.  Senator Leyden described the situation very well in terms of births, marriages and deaths.  A will could be discovered when death certificates are sought.  That would stop much pain and searching, a lot of cumbersome effort, when people do not know which solicitor is involved and they must go to various solicitors with whom the deceased person has had dealings.<\/p> <p>The Bill arises from Senator Leyden's vast experience as a public representative and his interaction with people who have had such a difficulty.  It is a very intelligent response to that difficulty and I congratulate him on it.  It is right to register wills and it is the right mechanism to do it along with births, marriages and deaths in the General Register Office in order that they are all under the one roof.  When one hears the Bill described and explained, one wonders why it has not been done in the past.  It is the right thing to do.<\/p> <p>I do not have anything further to contribute to the debate nor do I have time to so do.

There is strong value in encouraging the registration of wills, in terms of ensuring there is a paper trail, which is of such importance to families.  I concur with Senator O'Reilly that it might be very important to locate wills along with information on births, marriages and deaths.  As I understand it, this is simply an arrow that will provide people with a route to know where they might locate a will.  It would not compromise in any way the content of the will.  Neither is it simply an issue of property because it is an issue of family history as well.

A significant concern was identified by Senator Leyden, namely, that many people do not make wills.  In Ireland quite a number of people do not make wills at all.  This brings the making of wills into the mainstream and they will become one of the pieces of paper one is expected to file.  <\/p><p>I have some questions on the operation of the system.  I would like to hear more about that and debate the issue on Committee Stage.  I have the same concerns that others have expressed, in that where there is a last will and testament, circumstances may not allow for another will to be made and appropriately registered such as, for example, in the case of a person who is in the very late stages of an illness.<\/p><p>The question of which will takes precedence may be a separate question but could be teased out.  I am also conscious, as Senator Leyden said, that we have a precedent of having a register of wills in some form in many European countries.  I worked on the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe with Senator Leyden and I am sure he will be aware of the other models.  The Government might constructively consider the models in other European countries with similar registers.  I am sure as legislators we can find the very best model for Ireland, and that the Senator will be interested in working with people to find the model that will work.  <\/p><p>I look forward to Committee Stage of the Bill.

To be fair to him, he has pursued this particular issue relentlessly.  He initiated a Private Members' Bill in 2005, 2011 and again today.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in is supportive of the intentions behind the Bill, as the current system is archaic.  The current procedure is too loose, with no fallback when the will is misplaced, lost or, in some cases, destroyed.  At least with a register in place it would be known that a will had been made at some stage.  Without a register and without knowing whether a will has been made, there are long delays in allowing the intentions of a deceased person to be set out and unnecessary delays for the beneficiaries of a will.<\/p> <p>The death of a loved one is a traumatic time for families.  Turning houses, solicitors' offices or whatever else upside down while searching for wills that may have been filed for safekeeping adds to the stress.  Maintaining the privacy of the contents of a will is imperative to maintaining the integrity of the probate process.  Any changes to the current process will need to be managed extremely carefully to ensure an effective and accountable process remains in place.<\/p> <p>The essential details of a written will need to be kept private and the intentions of the deceased persons secured as it is their wish when they make a will.  Centralising the process that proves that a will was made and its location would be a most welcome move for the country once privacy is maintained within the system.  <\/p> <p>Many attempts have been made to set up a central register but all have failed.  I again thank the Senator for his tenacity in continually pushing this measure.  Ireland is way behind other countries in Europe in putting a register in place.  <\/p> <p>In the context of Europe and people living abroad who may have made a will, a central European register would make sense.  Ireland has been criticised many times for failing to possess the political will to implement a register.  The Senator cannot be faulted for this.  He has twice brought a Bill before the Seanad and twice a sitting Government has let him down in terms of progressing the Bills.  I hope the Minister will make sure of its progress.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill at this stage and look forward to working and making recommendations on amendments on future Stages to ensure that it passes and becomes law.  This cannot fail for the third time.<\/p> <p>There is a wider problem, namely, that the taking out of wills in Ireland by citizens is not done on a level anywhere near high enough.  Making a will is one of the most important and necessary acts that one carries out in one's adult life.  A campaign raising awareness or encouraging more people to take out wills on the back of this Bill would be most welcome.<\/p> <p>I look forward to working with other Senators to make sure a robust, yet transparent, central register is implemented.  Central to our support will, of course, be maintaining the privacy and integrity of the current wills process, but moving it into modern times and away from the dated and inefficient methods currently being used which have led to many problems and confusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#QQ00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Senator Leyden has put forward a very practical proposition, namely, the idea that wills should be registered.

Bearing that in mind, I feel registering wills should be mandatory because otherwise people will run into difficulties.<\/p> <p>People can make wills very simply.  Many people are anxious about the process, especially older people.  People associate the making of wills with the ending of one's life, and sometimes younger couples are more prepared to write a will than those who are older.  It is a very simple and relatively cheap process.  It puts one's affairs in order.  Most wills are not complex as they do not require trusts to be established and so on.  The making of wills should be encouraged.<\/p> <p>There are times when a person attends different solicitors in different towns and makes different wills.  One solicitor may register a will but another may not.  In order to give effect to the intent of the Bill, which is that people know about wills, it would have to be mandatory to register wills.  In order for a will to be formalised, it has to comply with certain legalities.  For example, it could be a requirement that wills are registered within a month.  Of course, people can make wills on their death beds and there would have to be provision to allow for such a flexibility. <\/p> <p>All in all, it is a very good idea and provides a good opportunity to encourage people to make wills.  Some 70% of people do not make a will.  Sometimes people are scared about going to a solicitor's office and think they will have to spend a lot of money, but that is not always the case.  One can ask what the cost will be.  From my experience, it is not expensive compared to many other legal services that are provided.  It provides peace of mind.  Aside from knowing how to deal with one's property, one can set out one's wishes about things that may be in doubt, such as where one wants to be buried.  One can have a will registered and forget about it.<\/p> <p>I hope the kernel of what the Senator is suggesting can be taken on board and that we can move on it.  It would be an improvement for probate.  People could rest assured that when a person dies another will is not in place and one does not override another.  <\/p> <p>Some people do not realise that when one gets married a will is no longer effective.  People who get married need to make another will.  Those who are remarrying need to make a second will.  Many colleagues in the Chamber can also add to my advice.

Having listened to the very short debate we have had, I am a little better disposed to the merits of the idea than I might have been even an hour ago.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the initiative of Senators Terry Leyden, Catherine Ardagh and Lorraine Clifford-Lee in drafting the Bill.  I can certainly see why it would be a good idea to provide for a statutory system to register wills.  It is important that people make a will as it makes it much more straightforward to administer a deceased person's estate and is simpler and less costly for families.  Where a deceased person has no family, it could help to avoid long delays and expense while his or her successors are being identified.  On the face of it, having a register of wills would seem to be a good way to locate a person's last will and testament.  It might also be a way to establish whether a will was ever made.  When one considers the proposal in more detail, however, it appears that registering wills might create as many problems as it would solve.  I can imagine that the Senators will want to deal with situations where, for example, wills are lost or a person has changed solicitor or where the family of a deceased person think there is a will but cannot locate it.  We all know that matters to do with people's estates can become very divisive, difficult and upsetting for those involved.<\/p> <p>We all have the right to settle our affairs as we see fit and, provided we have acted within the law, no one can interfere with this.  We are not obliged to publicise the fact that we have made a will, its contents or where it is lodged.  I realise the proposal is that registration be voluntary, but the problem is that a voluntary system would not stop people making multiple wills or codicils subsequent to the registration of a will and then not registering the existence of new wills or codicils on the register.  As such, the registered will might not actually be the last will and testament of the person concerned.  I am certainly not suggesting a compulsory system be introduced and acknowledge that the Senators are not proposing it in the Bill either.  I am simply pointing to some of the pitfalls in having a voluntary system.  I often say we always debate two laws in this and the other House; the law in front of us and the law of unintended consequences.  In that regard, I note that inheritance matters are not dealt with by my Department; as such, I would need to consult the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to obtain further information on the issue.  The Bill proposes that a person or his or her solicitor attend before the registrar to say a will has been made.  The actual will would not be deposited with the GRO, nor would the registrar see it.  There would be no proof that there was a will or that it was valid or that another will or codicil had not superseded it.  I acknowledge that the Senators may have considered these matters and have solutions to them.<\/p> <p>There have been some changes to the Bill since its original publication by Senator Terry Leyden in 2006.  The Registration of Wills Bill 2005 passed all Stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann but fell on the dissolution of the Oireachtas for the general election of 2007.  The Registration of Wills Bill 2011, again brought forward by Senator Terry Leyden, was similar to the 2005 Bill in that it provided for a voluntary system of registration by the GRO.  The Bill before us bears no substantive difference to the 2011 Bill.  The Bill was first introduced 11 years ago and, of course, things could have changed in that time.  <\/p> <p>When the 2005 Bill was introduced, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform sought the views of the Law Society of Ireland which expressed reservations about the legislation on a number of grounds, both in terms of its day-to-day practical implementation and the infringement of certain legal principles.  It pointed out that as the proposed registration of wills was to be voluntary, it would have limited effect.  Proponents of the register will suggest a number of wills go undiscovered or are destroyed each year, which sometimes results in the wrongful distribution of assets under the intestacy rules or the terms of a prior will.  However, there would still be these problems under a voluntary system.  In addition, the Law Society suggests the most the Bill's proposed registration system could achieve would be to confirm that a particular will was registered on a particular day.  Crucially, it would not be conclusive that the will registered was the last one.  <\/p> <p>A further concern is that the registration of a will is not proof of its validity.  As the Bill stands, it does not appear to require that the will being registered be executed in accordance with statutory requirements and be valid, nor would registration prove that the will was not made without undue influence.  The register would also accommodate the registration of DIY wills, a large proportion of which, experience suggests, do not comply with statutory requirements.  The Law Society also opined in 2006 that if the issue of the proper execution of wills was not addressed, it could call into question the veracity of the information held on a public register, a concern shared by my Department and an tArd-Cl&aacute;raitheoir.<\/p> <p>The Bill proposes that the GRO have responsibility for the registration of wills.  Civil registration was first introduced in 1845 for the registration of non-Catholic marriages and extended in 1864 to births, deaths and Catholic marriages.  Registration of adoptions was introduced in 1952 and civil partnerships in January 2011.  The date on the register forms a basic, continuous source of information on the population, providing a record of vital events relating to people and satisfying the need for evidence that has a bearing on rights, entitlements, liability, status and nationality.  Civil registration is relevant to each of us at important stages in our lives, beginning with the registration of our births and ending with our deaths.  Between these events, civil registration affects us directly, as in the case of marriage, and indirectly when certificates are required for many of the services available in society, including enrolling a child in school, obtaining a passport, taking up employment or claiming a social welfare payment.<\/p> <p>Each event registered under civil registration legislation has the benefit of an independent evidential basis.  Details of births are notified to the registrar independently of the parents, while details of deaths are attested either by way of a certificate provided by a medical practitioner who attended the deceased or a coroner's certificate.  Marriages are evidenced by the signatures of the parties to them, the witnesses and the solemnisers on the registration forms, details of which have been recorded by the registrar prior to the event.  As a result, the records of the GRO enjoy a very high reputation for integrity and credibility nationally and internationally and certificates of vital events are readily accepted as evidence of the facts recorded without any need for further investigation or inquiry.  A register of wills as provided for in the Bill would be significantly different from other registration functions the office already has.  As the scheme proposed is voluntary and, therefore, not comprehensive, it would be unable to guarantee that a registered will was the last one and had not been amended, revoked or superseded and that its validity could not be assured.  It is difficult to see how the scheme as proposed could achieve its objectives.  In addition, I am fearful that the good reputation enjoyed by our system of civil registration could be undermined.<\/p> <p>I understand the Bill was drafted against the background of the Council of Europe's Convention on the Establishment of a Scheme of Registration of Wills.  The convention provides for the establishment of national registration schemes and contains supplementary rules governing international co-operation between national authorities entrusted with the task of registration.  Ireland has not signed or ratified the convention.  It is also the case that there has not been enough time to consult the Law Society about the Bill to see if its views have changed in the ten years since it first considered the matter, particularly having regard to the fact that the Bill has been amended, mainly by the addition of a new section 13.  As such, it would be useful to consult the Law Society on the current Bill to see if its views have altered.  It would also be useful to hear from the Ard-Cl&aacute;raitheoir on his views and experience, as well as from other experts and interested parties, to tease out some of the issues.  The best way to achieve this is to support the passage of the Bill on Second Stage to allow it to proceed under the new arrangements to a pre-legislative scrutiny hearing at committee level when we can hear from all of those with an interest and expertise in the area and, perhaps, tease out the legislation further.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Leo Varadkar:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2192\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The best way to achieve that is to allow the Bill to pass through Second Stage and proceed to Committee Stage and, under the new arrangements, to allow for a pre-legislative scrutiny hearing so we can hear from all those who have an interest and expertise in this area and perhaps tease it out further.<\/p><p>Other issues that would need to be considered are fees to cover the administrative cost of the office, whether the GRO is the appropriate body and not the Probate Office, and whether a copy of the will should actually be kept on file in the GRO.  I note Senator Ardagh's point on the possibility of registration online.  Of course, one could potentially scan a will and register it online.  Also to be considered is the matter of whether the registered will should take precedence over subsequent wills.  A Senator suggested that we examine what is done in other countries to see what systems operate there.<\/p><p>While I will not be opposing the Bill today, I will not be able to support it further unless some of its flaws and some of the issues I have raised today can be corrected.  The best way to do that, however, is to allow it to proceed to Committee Stage, on which these issues can be teased out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#RR00400","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending to discuss the Bill in the House.  I am well aware of the resistance from the GRO in Roscommon.  I have experienced it for a very long time.  I hope it does not influence the Minister when he comes to think about this and that he will take a very independent approach.  I know he will and that he will be very progressive in so far as this is concerned.  I am quite confident that the Minister's senior officials will be the same.<\/p> <p>Of course the Bill is not perfect; it is to initiate something.  It is hard to get people to embrace something new.  I accept the arguments on the Probate Office and on whether it is the type of place to have the proposed register.  I will not go into details because we will deal with this on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Clifford-Lee for co-sponsoring the Bill and I thank Senators Noone, O'Reilly, Higgins, Devine, Mulherin and Ardagh for their contributions.  I also thank Senators Ardagh and Clifford-Lee for their input into the Bill.  I will not go through all the points made because this is a very early stage of this process.  I am delighted to see so many practitioners here.  It is interesting to have their input.  The Bill will proceed from the Seanad and will be based on the experience of Members here who can debate every line of it and may make it a reality.<\/p> <p>No information is proposed to be disclosed to anyone on the fact that a person has made a will.  That is a matter for oneself.  There is no requirement that the will registered must be the final will.  If somebody signs a will at the last minute, it is the one that will be probated, albeit ten weeks after registration.  That would be straightforward, normal information.<\/p> <p>The world has changed and Ireland has changed.  So many people of all nationalities are coming to Ireland and joining the community.  They could have made wills that may never be found.  Over the years as a Deputy and Minister of State, it came to my attention that so many people were disadvantaged by the fact that a will could not be found.  So many solicitors have got into trouble recently in this regard.  Who knows where the books are gone?  The register is the book that is held in the office of a particular solicitor.  It is a shame if somebody is deprived of a major entitlement.  People become very aggrieved when they feel they have been done out of their rights.<\/p> <p>My Bill is an effort to address this issue and I am not saying it is perfect.  This is one of the few countries in the Council of Europe area which does not have formal registration.  I suppose we will reach the stage at which there will have to be registration covering all of Europe so as to facilitate the bringing forward of information.<\/p> <p>I accept that the quality of the registration system at the GRO in Roscommon and here in Dublin is excellent.  The records are excellent.  This would be a voluntary scheme.  Nevertheless, if the Minister could make a small, simple start, what I propose could grow in time.  That is all I seek.  If the Probate Office is the correct location, I would have no problem with that as long as we could move this forward and deal with it on Committee Stage.  If the Minister has an open mind on this issue, it will be beneficial.  I certainly have an open mind on it and I have no hang-ups at all about it.  We could make it successful and see it through.  I am absolutely confident that when the Minister has time to study and think about this, having heard the contributions in the Seanad today, he will have a fresh approach.  I am very confident that he will see it through.  If he decides to see this through, we will do it together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#SS00200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481711400,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#SS00400","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#SS00500","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481711400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 20 December 2016.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#SS00650","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1481711400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016121400002#SS00675","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481711400,"counter":287,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 5.36 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 15 December 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
