Its main purpose is to facilitate the complete closure of St. Patrick's Institution.  It will repeal statutory provisions that enable the courts to order the detention of offenders under the age of 21 years in St. Patrick's Institution and also delete references to St. Patrick's Institution from the Statute Book.<\/p><p>St. Patrick's Institution was originally established in Clonmel early in the last century as a borstal institution for young male offenders.  It was transferred to its current site adjacent to Mountjoy Prison in 1956.  The Criminal Justice Act 1960 which gave it its statutory title made provision for the sentencing of offenders aged 16 to 20 years to detention in the institution.<\/p><p>As Senators, many of whom have campaigned on this issue, are aware, the detention of children in St. Patrick's Institution has been the subject of consistent criticism for many years.  The report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System under the chairmanship of Dr. T. K. Whitaker in 1985 noted that &quot;the dominant features of St. Patrick's for the majority of those contained there are boredom and demoralisation&quot;.  The report recommended the closing of St. Patrick's Institution as soon as possible, stating: <\/p><blockquote>Rehabilitation is not possible where the physical and environmental conditions are such as to nullify any personal developmental programmes.  The facilities and services which a human and morally acceptable detention centre should provide for juveniles could not be provided even in a renovated St. Patrick's.<\/blockquote> <p>In his annual report for 2004 and 2005 the former Inspector of Prisons, Mr. Justice Dermot Kinlen, described St. Patrick's Institution as a &quot;finishing school for bullying and developing criminal skills&quot;.  The detention of children in St. Patrick's Institution has been criticised by the Ombudsman for Children, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the European Committee on<\/p><p>Social Rights and the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights.  In addition, organisations such as the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Children's Rights Alliance have called for the detention of children in St. Patrick's Institution to be ended.<\/p><p>The programme for Government 2011 to 2016 included a commitment to end the practice of sending children to St. Patrick's Institution.  Very significant progress has been made by the Government in fulfilling this commitment.  Responsibility for 16-year-old males remanded in custody or sentenced to detention was transferred from the Irish Prison Service to the children detention schools at Oberstown in May 2012.  The &euro;56 million development of national children detention facilities at Oberstown which I was honoured to bring to the Government as the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is almost complete.  This development will increase the number of children detention places available on the campus to enable the transfer of responsibility for all children remanded in custody or sentenced to detention from the Irish Prison Service to the children detention schools.<\/p><p>In 2012 the Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, presented an inspection report on St. Patrick's Institution which raised serious issues and major concerns.  The inspector reported that a combination of, among other things, weak management, the culture in the prison, inattention to human rights norms, prisoners on protection and the prevalence of drugs meant that St. Patrick's Institution had not lived up to the mission statement of the Irish Prison Service.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The inspector concluded that there was a culture in St. Patrick's Institution that resulted in the human rights of some prisoners, children and young adults, being either ignored or violated.  In his 2012 report, the inspector acknowledged the efforts made by prison management to deal with the issues previously identified regarding St. Patrick's and the improvements made.  However, in a follow-up report in March 2013, he found disturbing incidents of non-compliance with best practice and breaches of the fundamental rights of prisoners.  The inspector reported that, despite the best efforts of management, the culture in St Patrick&rsquo;s had not changed and that the safe and secure custody of young offenders detained there could no longer be guaranteed.  He recommended that the facility be closed, that prisoners be dispersed to other institutions, that existing staff be likewise dispersed and that the name \"St. Patrick&rsquo;s\" be consigned to history.<\/p><p>In line with the recommendations of the Inspector of Prisons and to effect the changes necessary in regime and culture and ensure safe and secure custody, in July 2013 the Government decided to close St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  As an interim step, which was required pending the opening of the Oberstown facility, arrangements were made for sentenced 17 year old males to be transferred shortly after committal to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution to a dedicated unit in Wheatfield place of detention.  This is an interim measure until they can be accommodated in the new children detention facilities at Oberstown.  Males aged 18 to 20 years sentenced to detention are detained in a separate unit in Wheatfield.<\/p><p>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs subsequently made the necessary orders under the Children Act 2001 to transfer responsibility for newly-remanded 17 year old males to Oberstown from 30 March 2015.  However, for legal reasons, it has been necessary to retain St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution on a contingency basis for remands awaiting places in Oberstown.  The courts have on rare occasions remanded 16 and 17 year olds to St Patrick&rsquo;s for short periods until places in Oberstown became available.  This is a rare practice which will cease following enactment of the Bill and the closure of St. Patrick's Institution.  These children cannot be transferred to Wheatfield because section 88 of the Children Act 2001, which provides for the remand of children in custody, does not permit the transfer of remanded children from St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution to a place of detention.  The Children (Amendment) Act 2015, for which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has responsibility, was enacted earlier this year and is currently awaiting signature by the Minister.  When operational, this Act will enable the full transfer of responsibility for children in detention to the children detention schools.  The Act provides for the repeal of all legislative provisions which permit the detention of children in adult prison facilities.  The relevant provisions of the Children (Amendment) Act cannot be commenced until Oberstown is ready to receive sentenced persons under the age of 18 years.  This will happen when recruitment of staff for Oberstown is finalised.  A number of advertisements in this regard were placed in the public arena, including one last week.  When adequate staff have been recruited the legislation can be commenced, which I hope will be soon.  While the Irish Youth Justice Service has experienced difficulty with recruitment, the necessary staff are expected to be in place shortly.<\/p><p>Two partial closing orders under section 2 of the Prisons Act 1933 have been made in respect of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  However, it will be necessary for the Prisons Bill to be enacted before St. Patrick&rsquo;s can be completely closed.  The intention is that, when closed, the St. Patrick&rsquo;s buildings will be designated as part of the male section of Mountjoy Prison, which seems appropriate given their location.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, and I will give particular attention to the need for careful co-ordination of the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 and the Prisons Bill, when enacted.  <\/p><p>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill, in respect of which some detailed work was necessary to enable the closure of St. Patrick's Institution.  For example, section 3 provides for the repeal of certain enactments relating to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  The provisions to be repealed relate in the main to court powers to commit offenders under the age of 21 to detention in St. Patrick&rsquo;s and in the case of a custodial sentence imposed on such a person, he or she will be committed to his or her local committal prison and can subsequently be transferred onwards, where appropriate, to another prison or place of detention.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have had to put in place transitional provisions.<\/p><p>Part 2 will enable St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution to be completely closed which I am sure everybody in this House will welcome.  The main provision in this Part is section 6 which provides for the complete closing of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution by ministerial order.  The section also contains transitional provisions to deal with warrants for the committal or remand of persons to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution which remain unexecuted on the date it is closed.  They are all very normal transitional provisions one would expect to see in such a Bill.<\/p><p>Part 3 provides for the removal of references to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution from the Statute Book.  These provisions are contained in sections 7 to 22, inclusive.  I might mention that it is proposed to retain the references to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution in a small number of legislative provisions in order to avoid unintended consequences for the operation of these provisions, but that is just a technical point.<\/p><p>Part 4 deals with issues that have emerged in the closing of prisons.  The transfer of detainees aged 17 years and in the 18 to 20 age group out of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution required Wheatfield Prison to be closed and reopened as a place of detention.  Some dedicated units were established there to accommodate the detainees transferring from St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  When I visited, I noted that the new units were very different from the rest of the prison.  Every effort was made in the interim to ensure Wheatfield Prison would be more satisfactory and age appropriate than the previous facilities in place in it.  A permanent legislative solution is required to regularise the position.  I, therefore, propose to bring forward an amendment to section 2 of the Prisons Act 1933 which provides that the Minister for Justice and Equality may make a closing order directing the closing of a prison or part of a prison.  Members will understand why I must do this, as Wheatfield Prison was being used as a temporary solution at one point when we took on board what the Inspector of Prisons had to say in 2013.<\/p><p>Section 23 amends section 2 of the Prisons Act 1933.  The proposed amendments have two purposes.  The first is to provide that, following the closure of a prison, any outstanding warrants that refer to that prison as the place of committal can be executed in another specified prison.  The second purpose is to address the position of persons on temporary release from a prison which has been closed.  All such situations must be addressed in the legislation.<\/p><p>We are all aware that the path from St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution to Mountjoy Prison has been too well worn during the years.  We must interrupt the predictable path of violence and crime and repeat offending progressing to further serious offending and committals in adult prisons.  The unprecedented programme of reform in closing St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and developing the national children detention facilities at Oberstown will allow us to place these young people in a secure environment that will offer them a second chance to be productive people who contribute to society.  We will continue to develop other options for young people who get into trouble with the law because while a secure environment suits some young people, others can be helped in an alternative way.  The Bill will allow us to place the young people who need it in a secure environment which I hope will offer them a second chance.  The young people who were referred to St. Patrick's Institution in the past but who are now referred to Oberstown have a wide variety of needs and need a lot of intervention in order to help them to get that second chance and be productive people who can contribute to society.  <\/p><p>I hope the Bill will be passed by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in order that St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution will finally be consigned to history at the earliest possible date.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#C00600","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.

When the Minister is not in this country, she is elsewhere in Europe or other parts of the world representing us.  I wish her well.  <\/p> <p>I am taking the Bill on behalf of my colleague, Senator Denis O'Donovan.  It allows for the closure of St. Patrick's Institution in Dublin, something that has been advocated for for quite some time and which we very much welcome.  While the institution was supposed to assist in the housing and reformation of young adult offenders and children in certain circumstances, the model applied has largely failed and been widely criticised, a point to which the Minister alluded.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2017\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is incredible to think the calls made to close St. Patrick's Institution date back to the recommendations made in 1985 in the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System which was chaired by Dr. T. K. Whitaker.<\/p><p>We all agree that it is a great shame that approximately 800 people under the age of 26 years are incarcerated in prisons.  We all further agree that prison is no place for a young person.  A new approach needs to be taken to address young offenders to ensure their rehabilitation rather than incarceration.  This is the central aim of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s penal policy.  In that regard, the closure of St. Patrick's Institution is a small step forward.<\/p><p>The issue of penal reform, in general, is one the Seanad has debated considerably, particularly during this term.  Much of the debate has stemmed from the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on penal reform which was published in March 2013.  I pay tribute, in particular, to the Members of this House who were on the committee which called for five key actions to address the challenges in the criminal justice and penal systems.  The first action sought was a reduction in prison numbers.  The committee was concerned about the significant increase in recent years in the numbers of prisoners.  It strongly recommended the adoption of a decarceration strategy through a declared intention by the Government to reduce the prison population by one third over ten years.  It is obvious from the justice system that, oftentimes, prison, instead of reforming the individual in custody, makes him or her more likely to reoffend.  A 2013 report from the Irish Prison Service and the Central Statistics Office showed that criminals had a reoffending rate of 62.3% within three years, while over 80% of those who reoffended did so within 12 months of release.  This is a most depressing figure.  However, I commend the Minister for recognising this problem.  While I hope more work can be done in this regard, I welcome the latest initiative announced by her to tackle the problem of repeat offenders.  If the programme is successful, it will be a great feather in her cap.  I still remain sceptical, however, that State agencies have the ability and the vision to truly address the problem of repeat offenders once and for all.  There is no question that all State institutions must work to rehabilitate the people concerned and offer them another way of life, rather than a life of crime.  Not only is the justice system not effective in reforming offenders' actions, it is also costly.  The average cost of imprisonment per prisoner comes to &euro;75,000.  This is one reason the Oireachtas joint committee recommended that all sentences of imprisonment under six months imposed for non-violent offences be commuted and replaced by community service orders.<\/p><p>The joint committee also endorsed the Irish Penal Reform Trust&rsquo;s recommendation of a simple Bill which would set out the basis for a structured release system to include proposed changes to remission, temporary release and parole.  The committee recommended that this legislation could also provide a statutory framework for an expanded community return programme, as well underpinning the strategies used by groups working with offenders after release and potential offenders.  In that regard, it is obvious a community return programme would be most worthwhile and address many of the matters about which I have spoken.  It is foolish to believe an individual engaged in criminal activity will simply stop reoffending if he or she has to serve a sentence.<\/p><p>In July 2014 the strategic review of penal policy was published by the Department of Justice and Equality.  It contained 43 recommendations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2017\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would interested to know how many of those recommendations were subsequently implemented.  Far too often, Governments of all hues commission reports, which contain recommendations based in evidential policy-making, only for those reports to be left on a shelf to gather dust.  This Minister is very proactive and I hope she will not leave that committee's report on a shelf but that she will implement most, if not all, of its recommendations.  Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports this Bill and looks forward to its speedy passage through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#E00200","speaker":"1164","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I extend what appears to be an almost daily welcome to the Minister to this House.  She is probably one of the hardest working members of Government, if not the hardest working.  I go home on a Friday evening but the Minister will pop up in Brussels, which shows her commitment to public service.<\/p> <p>This Bill is very welcome.  I was part of a delegation from the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which included my colleague, Senator Bacik, and others, that visited the Mountjoy campus and St. Patrick's Institution.  We saw what the staff there were trying to achieve but it was not fit for purpose.  The correct strategy, which was part of the commitment in the programme for Government in 2011, is to close St. Patrick's Institution.  This legislation is appropriate but, in essence, it is technical in nature.  The decision has been made to close the institution, which is happening, but for legal and technical reasons, this Bill is necessary as a tidying up exercise and to proceed with the completion of the project. <\/p> <p>No young person should end up in prison, if at all possible.  This House unanimously passed motions on restorative justice and the need for a community court and I am pleased the Department of Justice and Equality and Minister are committed to developing pilot projects, in particular in the area of restorative justice.  The pilot projects in north Tipperary and south county Dublin have been very successful and I would like them to be extended nationwide.  We have seen the success of restorative justice practices in Northern Ireland in recent years and their success in places such as Canada, Australia and elsewhere.  There are also the unofficial restorative practices that have been engaged in by community groups, which perhaps many of us do not know about and which are achieving significant results, particularly some of those taking place in schools.  <\/p> <p>Young people who commit crime usually do so because of a set of circumstances in which they find themselves, such as social deprivation or not having the opportunities others have.  They are the issues with which we need to deal.  We need to equip those young people with opportunities to ensure they can play a meaningful role in society.  Many people turn to crime because they do not feel they have any hope in society.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality published a groundbreaking report on penal reform and I pay tribute to Senator Bacik for her work in this area.<\/p> <p>Prior to taking up her role as Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald was Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, at which time she started a necessary conversation followed by actions, which have resulted in children in this country being recognised properly as a result of the referendum and as a result of our having a senior Minister with responsibility for children.  It is probably an appropriate progression that this Minister would take over as Minister for Justice and Equality to further develop the commitment this Government has to children.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge that Senator Wilson and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party are supporting this Bill.  I hope it gets unanimous support in the House because it is necessary, important and technical in nature.  We are all committed to the one goal here.  This House regularly comes together and unanimously supports something that is right and proper, and this is right and proper.  It will be another significant achievement for the Houses of the Oireachtas if we can get this Bill over the line and ensure St. Patrick's Institution is consigned to its place in history.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#G00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The practice of detaining children in the adult prison system, namely, St. Patrick's Institution, was contrary to a number of Ireland's international human rights obligations.  It was counterproductive as a means of steering children away from future criminality and it represented a poor reflection of the State's policy towards children.  Concerns and criticisms about the practice were levied against Ireland domestically, regionally and internationally for more than 30 years in the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System, the Whitaker report, of 1985, to which the Minister referred, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child concluding observations in 2006, the European committee for the prevention of torture as recently as February 2012, and the UN committee against torture concluding observations of July 2011.<\/p> <p>Particular credit should be given to the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Children's Rights Alliance which had consistently campaigned for the closure of St. Patrick's Institution and had kept the associated children's rights violations to the fore.  The introduction of the Bill is an historic day for children's rights, juvenile justice and the progressive reform of our penal policy.  It realises the programme for Government commitment in 2011 to end the practice of sending children to this institution.  I support and welcome entirely the closure of the institution.  I commend the Government and, in particular, the Minister, who was the former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and her successor, Deputy Reilly, for their hard work, commitment and initiative in completing this task.<\/p> <p>I do not wish to be a killjoy or to detract from what is clearly a great success.  However, given the time I have left in the House, I must take this opportunity to raise a number of concerns about child detention currently.  I am concerned that with the closure of this institution, there will be a perception that the detention of children in adult institutions has ended which, of course, is not the case.  While since 30 March 2015, all newly-remanded 17 year old males are committed to Oberstown, those sentenced to detention are committed to Wheatfield Prison, which is unsuitable for their needs.  As of today, 13 boys of 17 years of age are serving sentences in this prison - I checked the figure earlier.<\/p> <p>I also have concerns about Oberstown, some of which were reflected in a letter to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, following a visit there by members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, including me, in June 2015.  There is a need for the institution to publish its data.  An accountable, transparent method of recording and making available data on violent and intimidatory incidents between residents is needed.  It is essential that the safety of young people in Oberstown be prioritised.  I have heard examples of six boys in a unit turning on one boy with only two staff on hand to contain the six boys if things got out of hand.  It is not unfeasible that a young person could come to serious harm and I would like the Government to put mechanisms in place now rather than reacting later to a tragic incident involving death or serious injury to a child in detention.<\/p> <p>Published information is needed on Oberstown's daily occupancy and capacity figures which separate out children on remand and children under sentence.  All prisons, including Wheatfield, which expressly specifies the number of 17 year olds it holds, do this.  It is vital that interested parties can monitor the use of remand on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>The Minister will be aware from a number of my previous interventions that I have ongoing concerns around the overuse of remand for children.  There is no rationale for keeping these figures out of the public domain, especially when the Irish Youth Justice System has not published an annual report since 2011.  We need to track the nature and type of charges for which children are remanded and committed.  According to Oberstown staff, the profile of charges has become more serious over the years and this has an impact for risk assessment both of staff and the children involved.<\/p> <p>I would like to highlight the need for specific and ongoing training to deal with the increased age cohort.  I have raised this issue with the Minister of Children and Youth Affairs on a number of occasions.   These young people are physically bigger, display more challenging behaviour and have more serious charges against them, which changes the dynamic between the staff and younger boys who do not want to be seen to comply or buy in when the older boys are around.   This concern was raised in the visiting committee report for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution in 2014.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While Oberstown is within the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, we have an opportunity to consider a new system of sanctions and what we do with poor behaviour or escalating violence.  Perhaps we need to look again at the issue and draw from best practice.  We have a real opportunity to do things afresh with Oberstown.<\/p><p>The European committee for the prevention of torture visited Oberstown in 2014 and published a report in November 2015.  Important concerns that the committee raised throughout the report include excessive use of force and handcuffs, use of lock-up due to insufficient staffing levels, insufficient access to natural light and austerity of the rooms, staff numbers and ratios and the need to photograph, record and report.  I note a particularly worrying comment in the Government's response to the report that the operational capacity of 90, comprising 84 boys and six girls, \"will be reviewed\"; there are currently 54 places, comprising 48 boys and six girls.  We are aware that staffing shortages have been raised by Members and the ability to replace staff out due to illness and injury must be examined before we look to expand.  We need to consider children being placed on remand in Oberstown inappropriately.  Perhaps we should not be looking at any increase but rather at dealing with this issue effectively.<\/p><p>The Minister raised the HIQA report of June 2015.  It was a follow-up inspection report that identified widespread and unacceptable use of single separation and this must be addressed.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust did a report on monitoring and accountability in Oberstown at the end of 2014 that identified a number of concerns with monitoring mechanisms, including around adequate resourcing of monitoring bodies, the lack of enforcement of the recommendations of monitoring bodies and the outdated nature of the standards used for inspection of the children detention schools.<\/p><p>The last point I raise relates to the assessment, consultation and therapy service, ACTS, which are supposed to assess all children remanded or committed to detention but this is not happening.  According to staff, this is due to limited availability and logistics.  Some children are regarded as too violent or difficult for ACTS, which begs the question of what are the criteria for ACTS?  What message are we sending to a young person by saying he or she is too violent or difficult to reach.  It is unacceptable that this service can disengage from working with a young person and surely this is what they are about.<\/p><p>I fully support this Bill but I had to take this opportunity to raise some of my concerns.  What is being done today is historic and significant but I ask the Minister to consider the issues I raise relating to children in detention.  We need to ensure that we can look at the other options available, particularly for children on remand and the children in Oberstown, so we do not use outdated practices in their detention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#H00100","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to the House and echo the words of others about her incredible working record.  I also welcome her hard-working officials, as we are conscious of the volume of legislation coming through from the Department of Justice and Equality.  This is historic legislation, as others have said, which I very much welcome.  I was moved when reading the language of the Bill, particularly the first line, which is \"an Act to provide for the closing of Saint Patrick's Institution\".  Like many others, I have campaigned for its closure for many years with the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  Senator van Turnhout has mentioned the Children's Rights Alliance and the Minister mentioned the long history of constant criticism to which Ireland has been subjected from international bodies and internally, from our own Inspector of Prisons and the Whittaker report of 30 years.  There was an appalling culture and abuses perpetrated on children and young adults, including violation of human rights, within St. Patrick's Institution.  It is very welcome to see this final stage in the legislative process moving towards its closure.<\/p> <p>As Senator Conway has said, this is almost technical legislation, despite the rather moving language in it as the decision to close was taken some years ago.  I will speak in a moment about the process that has led to it and will return later to the criticism issue.  I remember representing young offenders before the children's courts, with many of them being desperately sad cases.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those of us who practised criminal law or worked on the front line remember the whispered stories of sexual and physical abuse and the drugs culture in St. Patrick's Institution, all of which was documented by successive inspectors of prisons.  One former inspector, Mr. Justice Dermot Kinlen, described St. Patrick's Institution as a finishing school for bullying and developing criminal skills and uttered stronger language about it in private.  The groundbreaking 2012 report of inspector of prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, on the culture of violations there played an important and pivotal role in the decision to close it.  In the 1990s, the work of the recently deceased Dr. Paul O'Mahoney, a leading criminologist, on recidivism in the Irish criminal justice system exposed St. Patrick's Institution, as Mr. Justice Kinlen said, as a breeding ground for future criminality.  The average prisoner in Mountjoy would have spent time in St. Patrick's and would have been reconvicted nine or ten times on average.  Senator Wilson quoted more figures on recidivism which expose the legacy of St Patrick's Institution.  It has been a black spot on the Irish record in terms of penal policy and children's rights.  <\/p><p>In his report on penal reform published 30 years ago, T.K. Whitaker recommended that St. Patrick's be closed.  Some 20 years on, in 2005, a follow-up to the Whitaker report again recommended its closure.  It is great to see that it is finally being closed, 30 years after the Whitaker report.  This is hugely progressive in terms of penal reform policy and children's rights.  The policy decision to end the practice of detaining children in St Patrick's Institution was hugely welcome when it was made in 2011 and there has also been a number of progressive steps which the Irish Penal Reform Trust has welcomed.  The trust has been to the forefront of ensuring closure.  Following the inspector of prisons' report, there were commitments made by the Minister in 2012, when she was Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The current Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, signed ministerial orders in March of this year to end the practice of remanding children to St. Patrick's Institution.  In addition, the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 has been enacted.  There have been progressive stages involved, not only of a legislative nature.  As the Minister said, it also required the expansion of Oberstown.  I note the building work is almost complete on the expansion of the Oberstown campus.  The Minister also mentioned the recruitment of staff.  Senator van Turnhout has said it is a key issue and one about which there is some concern regarding whether the necessary staff can be recruited in time.<\/p><p>I have three points to raise on the practical impact of the legislation.  In terms of timing, when will the Bill take effect?  We intend to pass it as swiftly as possible.  I am delighted that it has been commenced in the Seanad.  I hope it will be passed by the D&aacute;il next week and that the ministerial order commencing its provisions will be signed.  Under section 6, a closure order will be required.  Before the latter can be signed, it will need to be co-ordinated with the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Children (Amendment) Act 2015.  We would also need to see the relevant staff in place and the campus at Oberstown finally completed.  Can the Minister say exactly when the Act and this historic provision will take effect?<\/p><p>On the question Senator van Turnhout raised, we know from the Irish Penal Reform Trust that 13 boys are currently detained at Wheatfield Prison.  I think they are all 17 year olds so it may be that they will age out, - in other words they will reach 18 shortly - but one does not know.  How long is it proposed that boys under the age of 18 will be detained at Wheatfield?  That is a matter of concern.  Will it be possible, when this legislation is brought into force and the closure order is made, for those boys to be transferred to complete the remainder of their sentence until they turn 18?<\/p><p>Senator Conway mentioned the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality's report on penal reform a number of years ago and kindly referenced my contribution to it as rapporteur.  In the same spirit as Whitaker's report 30 years ago, we recommended that imprisonment should be a sanction of last resort and that a commitment should be made to reducing the number of people imprisoned.  Since the Government took office in 2011, there has been a reduction in the number of people being detained in prison, which is welcome.  Others have mentioned the community return programme - a hugely progressive initiative - which has shown really positive results in tackling recidivism rates and reducing reoffending.<\/p><p>My concern is that if, on the closure of St. Patrick's, its buildings are designated as part of the male section of Mountjoy Prison, this would lead to an expansion of the adult places available in Mountjoy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->An expansion of prison places tends to lead to an expansion of the use of imprisonment as a sanction, which would be unwelcome.  It is clear that prison is needed, in particular for offences of violence and for offenders who are serious recidivists who commit serious crimes, but when we looked at the issue in detail in the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, we were conscious that a large number of people were still being detained and imprisoned for very minor matters such as non-payment of fines.  We must ensure we do not expand prisons for the sake of it and that we do not see any regression in terms of returning to a position where we are simply building up the numbers of people detained.  I would be concerned about what the redesignation of the St. Patrick's buildings would mean in terms of the adult prison population.<\/p><p>The Bill is very welcome and I am sure it will be welcomed across the House.  It marks a change in approach from retributive punishment and sanction to rehabilitation.  The culture in Oberstown is clearly about rehabilitation and, as the Minister said, seeking to give people a second chance, which is hugely welcome.  The Bill marks an historic day in terms of penal reform and the development of children's rights, so I very much welcome it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#J00200","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome.  The Bill is also particularly welcome.  I add to what others have said in terms of the great effort the Minister is putting in, but she is also achieving much success.  I congratulate her in this regard.  We are honoured to have her here so often introducing Bills such as the one before the House.<\/p> <p>I sent a birthday card today to Dr. T. K. Whitaker, who will be 99 tomorrow.  I will speak to him later on about today and the fact he has been mentioned so often.  He is a former Member of this House, as was the Minister herself.  It is a delight to see that something he recommended 30 years ago is taking place.  He will be very pleased to know that.<\/p> <p>I remember speaking on a prison Bill many years ago when I was first elected the House.  I was trying to work out in my mind why we put people in prison.  Senator Bacik referred to the issue in one way, namely, to protect society.  In another way it is a punishment, to ensure a person is discouraged from doing something again.  However, by far the most principled approach to take to criminals is rehabilitation and to consider what we must do to ensure we give people another chance.<\/p> <p>I was only once in a prison, on a visit to Wheatfield Prison.  I was involved with the leaving certificate applied course.  I was very impressed with the work being done with younger people, not necessarily under 17 years, who were being taught the leaving certificate applied course, many of whom had never learned to read or write in school.  They had fallen out of the system and that got them into a bad habit.  One of the reasons I was impressed is that we got our meal in the prison that evening and it had been cooked by two young men who had learned how to cook there.  I am confident they would have gone on to benefit from that because the education they got in prison was such that it would enable them to stay out of prison in future and stay away from crime.  Senator Conway expressed the hope that we would have the unanimous support of the House.  I think the Minister will have that.  It is very difficult to see how anyone would disagree with what she is attempting to achieve.<\/p> <p>We have all read of the issues that surround St. Patrick's Institution.  In recent years a considerable number of people under the age of 21 were held on a 23-hour lock-up.  That just seems horrific.  The closure of St. Patrick's, which the Bill will bring about, is very welcome, and thus the Government will be able to end the practice of sending children to the institution.  The transition process has taken some time.  It is an ongoing process.  It is worth mentioning that when the Council of Europe delegation visited St. Patrick's in September last year, it noted that five 17 year olds were still being remanded there.  However, it could be said that the Council of Europe's newly published report carried a relatively positive assessment of child detention facilities in this country.  That is a considerable improvement on the situation that pertained in the past.  The report highlighted high levels of violence in prison, to which previous speakers referred, and the practice of slopping out as well as the detention of failed asylum seekers in prison.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Feargal Quinn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While we have seen considerable progress with regard to young offenders, we could learn more from the best European policies and practices in this area.  It is worth noting that in Germany education and vocational training are central principles for young people in custody.  Another principle worth noting is that in Germany and the Netherlands, young people aged 18 to 21 can be treated either as juveniles or adults.  This is an interesting concept to consider.  Whether a person is treated as a juvenile or an adult depends on the seriousness of the crime, the circumstances in which it was committed and the personality of the defendant.  We must tailor the punishment by taking age into consideration.  Just because someone has turned 18 does not necessarily mean that he or she can be regarded as a fully competent adult.  The number of people who are unable to read or write at that age is a good example of that.  <\/p><p>We should use community service much more than is currently the case, rather than sending people to prison.  The highly respected policy think tank, Howard League for Penal Reform, conducted research demonstrating that community service can reduce re-offending by up to 22% compared with short custodial sentences of up to 12 months.  Community service often means that work gets done that probably would not have been done.  It also provides offenders with a work routine, builds their self esteem and can change their lives for the better, unlike locking them up at enormous cost to the taxpayer.  In the UK community service is now officially referred to as compulsory unpaid work.  Why not call a spade a spade here too?  I ask the Minister to give her views on this.<\/p><p>One of the issues related to both juvenile and adult justice is that of restorative justice, where the offender pays back for his or her crime.  In some European countries citizens can nominate a local project or vote for a project that they wish to see benefit from unpaid labour.  In that way, citizens have a worthwhile input into the justice system.  This is a concept that is worth considering in the Irish context.<\/p><p>Finally, it is worth asking if wider society could play any part in juvenile justice policy.  There is a plan in the UK which involves academics and free schools, that is state-funded schools which are free of local council control, being invited to take over the education of young offenders.  The aim is to create what have been termed \"secure training colleges\" in order to improve the rehabilitation of young offenders.  <\/p><p>I am delighted that the Minister has grabbed hold of this issue and am confident that this Bill will pass through both Houses quickly.  The next stage is to make sure that its provisions are implemented as quickly as possible, which I have no doubt the Minister will achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#L00200","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  All legal practitioners, as well as those involved in law reform, human rights and children's rights will welcome this Bill which facilitates the complete closure of St. Patrick's Institution.  I was justice spokesperson for my party back in 2004 when this House debated the report of the inspector of prisons, who was Mr. Justice Kinlen at the time.  He referred to St. Patrick's Institution as a school for bullying and the development of criminal skills.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maurice Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I was struck by that statement and it has remained with me.  It was also the reason I called for the closure of St. Patrick's Institution in 2004.  I am very glad the day of its closure is near at hand.  The Minister is to be commended on progressing this issue, which is close to the hearts of many of those involved in law reform and the legal system.<\/p><p>Senators spoke about tackling recidivism.  It is very important to address this issue, along with the need for greater rehabilitation.  The former Deputy Jim O'Keeffe produced a paper on restorative justice, an issue raised by Senator Quinn.  This is a laudable approach that must be taken on board by members of the public, who must want restorative justice if it is to work.  I am aware that a pilot project in this area had good results.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik referred to the imprisonment of people for failure to pay small fines imposed for not having a television licence and so forth.  This practice never ceases to amaze me.  People who cannot or will not pay fines should have the amounts deducted from their social welfare payments or salaries.  The courts should not be involved in the process once a fine has been imposed.  It should be deducted from people who fail or refuse to pay it.  Many judges have indicated they would be willing to work out a system for achieving this.  It should be done automatically.  The Government has spoken about this option for some time and while some action has been taken on the issue, the Government should go the whole way and have fines automatically deducted from social welfare payments and salaries. <\/p><p>As I stated, this is a good day in respect of St. Patrick's Institution.  I welcome the significant expenditure on the Oberstown centre, which I hope will provide a secure environment for young persons in future and offer them with a second chance to play a productive role in society.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#M00200","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; nach bhfuil Sinn F&eacute;in ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille seo ach an oiread.  Sinn F&eacute;in is not opposed to the Bill.  As the Minister stated, the main purpose of the legislation is to facilitate the complete closure of St. Patrick's Institution.  It repeals statutory provisions that enable the courts to order the detention of offenders under the age of 21 years in St. Patrick's Institution and deletes references to \"St. Patrick's Institution\" in the Statute Book.<\/p> <p>In part, the Bill owes its origins to a commitment given in the programme for Government to end the practice of sending children to St. Patrick's Institution.  For decades, non-governmental organisations, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and a plethora of international organisations, including the United Nations, have called for the closure of St. Patrick's Institution and an end to the detention of children in adult prisons.  Across the child protection and criminal justice spectrum, there is unanimous agreement on the importance and significance of ending the practice of detaining children in adult prisons.  For example, the Irish Penal Reform Trust has repeatedly pointed out that adult prisons are completely unsuitable for meeting the particular needs of young offenders.  This sentiment was echoed by the new Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, who stated that rehabilitation must be a paramount consideration in the detention of young people.<\/p> <p>The legal erasing of St. Patrick's Institution and the addition of six new buildings, each with a capacity to house between eight and ten children, are positive steps.  Again, the Ombudsman for Children and the Irish Penal Reform Trust agree that the Oberstown centre is the most appropriate environment for the small number of young people for whom detention is necessary.  However, both entities have also expressed concern at the findings of a report by the Health Information and Quality Authority published on 23 February concerning two inspections it carried out on the Oberstown centre in October and November 2014.  Of a total of ten standards, HIQA found that the child detention schools met just one - education - in full.  Six standards were found to require improvement, and the failure to meet three standards was found by HIQA to present significant risk.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These were in the areas of single separation, the management of medication and staffing and training issues.  The isolation of any child or young person from his or her peers can be damaging and the standards are clear that isolation must only be used sparingly and for the minimum, appropriate period of time.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, is particularly concerned at reports that single separation was used due to staff shortages.  Concerns regarding insufficient staffing, staff training and high levels of staff absenteeism are also detailed in the inspection report.  In a 12-month period, more than 700 cases of single separation were recorded at Oberstown, with one child spending more than 83 hours in isolation over a four-day period.  <br\/><br\/>It has been proven that in areas where supports exist for minors who are exposed to violence or trouble in their communities, these supports significantly reduce the number of children who get into trouble with the law.  We must start discussing the issue of early intervention and prevention.  We must create a system which is humane and progressive - a rehabilitation process which encourages all children to reach their full potential rather than a system which negatively impacts future generations for life.<br\/><br\/>It is worth reminding ourselves that this State's reputation in regard to prisons is justly criticised for being embarrassing.  The Government should be embarrassed.  Ireland is one of only four European countries not to have ratified the UN's anti-torture protocol.  Professor Malcolm Evans, whose work focuses on preventing torture and degrading treatment, expressed frustration at the fact that the Government has repeatedly promised but failed to ratify a system of independent, international inspections.  He said at the last universal periodic review of the human rights records of all 193 UN member states in 2011, that Ireland's failure to sign up to the UN's anti-torture protocol was openly criticised, even by some countries in the developing world with very poor human rights records.  Professor Evans said some would reach the conclusion the justice authorities in Ireland had an issue with transparency and accountability.  The protocol provides for the UN and national bodies to make unannounced visits to all places of detention, including prisons, police stations and psychiatric hospitals and to report on what they find.  The bodies have the power to examine the facilities and interview staff and detainees in confidence as part of that inspection process.<br\/><br\/>I note a certain irony to the scheduling of business today.  I welcome the fact that we are closing down St. Patrick's Institution, which Senator Bacik rightly called a &quot;black spot on the Irish record&quot;, but this is being done on foot of a report done 30 years ago.  I seriously hope we will not be in a similar position in regard to what we are doing on direct provision, namely, that we institutionalise it <i>ad nauseam<\/i>and in 30 years' time other parliamentarians will be here debating  reports about how that system is not living up to the human rights standards it should.  In numerous reports, the direct provision system has been called a form of open prison and has been reported as violating human rights.  It has been termed as &quot;privatised institutionalisation&quot;.  In the case of St. Patrick's Institution, we had HIQA oversight, but we do not have that independent oversight of the direct provision system and the Ombudsman has no role in overseeing it.<br\/><br\/>In the context of closing down one prison today, I call on all Senators to ensure that we do not perpetualise another open prison type system in the direct provision system later today and to vote against the Bill coming up in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#N00200","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill.

He came into a strange town and looked to put a coin in the box for a parking permit, but there was a sign up saying the machine was out of order.  He went and got his part and had a cup of tea and a sandwich after his long journey from the south of Ireland.  Unfortunately a ticket was placed on his car and, feeling aggrieved, he rang the people concerned.  He talked and appealed but to no avail.  His mistake was that he did not turn up at the District Court a year later for the hearing.  That poor individual was arrested and dragged from a remote part of southern Ireland, with the assistance of the Garda, all the way up to Mountjoy because of a parking fine.  He was let out the same day.  I rang the prison governor who was embarrassed that this should happen.  We must get away from this system of penalising people by sending them to prison for one, seven or 14 days.<\/p><p>I welcome the closure of St. Patrick's Institution.  No person under 18 should be in prison, unless there is a very serious reason.  There is community service as well as other methods which were mentioned by Senator Cummins.<\/p><p>People who are not paying fines should have the money taken from their pensions, social welfare or some other source.  We recently had the case - I think it was last year - of an elderly lady in some part of Dublin who had a television dish up on the side of her house.  The local authority acted on a complaint about the dish and she was apparently committed to prison.  This is the sort of thing we must avoid.<\/p><p>If we are serious about reform, we must have a root and branch overhaul.  People who have not committed a crime, in the real sense of having attacked, viciously assaulted or stabbed someone, should not be going to prison.  There are instances where, for their own safety and the safety of others, people have to be in prison.  As well as the young people who will hopefully be saved from St. Pat's - it is a place I visited once in my capacity as a solicitor - I hope that we can get rid of imprisonment for petty offences.  It has been going on for over 100 years that someone in default of a fine, say of &euro;50, gets seven or 14 days.  We must move away from that.  Sending people to prison for non-payment of fines or of small payments due to credit unions or whatever is sending out the wrong signal.

It is long overdue indeed, as we know, and I am delighted to be in a position to bring the Bill to the House.  We have had wide-ranging comments on the associated issues that arise when we talk about young or older people being in detention centres and prisons.  Some really interesting points have been raised.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I should note the penal reform report, which I published in the course of the year and on the implementation of which I now have a working group, addresses quite a few of the issues raised by Senators.  It is an extremely good report and the people responsible for it were highly expert and had a wide-ranging range of expertise.  It addresses quite a few of the issues raised by Senators on keeping people out of prison, as well as some of the points Senator Quinn made about rehabilitation, training and the kinds of interesting initiatives that can be seen in other countries regarding  people who are detained to ensure they get a second chance and that their lives of crime can be interrupted effectively.  This has been a helpful debate and I reiterate that many of the issues are addressed in the aforementioned penal reform report.<\/p><p>Let us consider some of the figures, for example, in respect of community returns.  Pilot projects were carried out over the past year, and at present 100 prisoners are in the community return programme, which is being run between the Prison Service and the Probation Service.  It is a good programme.  The success rate has been high and the incidence of crimes committed by people on the programme has been very low.  Consequently, that kind of programme really is worth trying.  The new fines legislation, which was mentioned by Senator Cummins and a number of other Members, will come into effect from the first week in January and will implement the legislation that has passed through the House.  The Courts Service has been working on its implementation because it required some developments on the information technology side.  Senators Bacik and Conway welcomed the Bill and asked the question as to the actual closure.  In this regard, the last remaining issue is the recruitment of staff and it is a question of making sure those staff can be put in place.  I cannot emphasise enough its critical importance, as it pertains to the recruitment of care staff and ensuring the requisite number of staff are ready to deal with the young people who will be remanded and will be sent to Oberstown.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection and I have discussed this matter and she certainly will take any action she can to ensure people know about these jobs that are available.  While they undoubtedly are demanding jobs, as working in a closed institution is highly demanding, there are people around who have done this kind of work, who are skilled and who may be looking for work.  It is to be hoped they will be attracted to work in Oberstown and I note the terms and conditions also have been improved somewhat.  I ask anyone who is in a position to advise people who may be interested in this to do so, because it is really important that we get the staff in place to open the additional units so that we can deal with the numbers.  Thereafter, everybody who is under 18 and who is referred will end up in one of the units in Oberstown rather than in Wheatfield Prison.  The people who are in Wheatfield at present will serve out their sentence there, but thereafter, once the staff are in place, all new referrals will go directly to Oberstown.<\/p><p>I must state that this is a nice opportunity to send birthday greetings to Dr. Whitaker from the House, and I believe he would be pleased.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#P00300","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#Q00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>While I am sure he would state that it has taken far too long for his recommendation to be implemented, nevertheless, as Senator Quinn noted, we should take this opportunity to send him birthday greetings for his 99th birthday tomorrow and to thank him for his considerable service to the State.  A number of other people were mentioned here today, including the late Dr. Paul O'Mahony, who had a huge interest in how children and young people are treated when they come to the attention of the law.  He did really sterling work and influenced many of the policies that have been developed by the highly progressive Probation Service.<\/p> <p>I agree with Senators across the Chamber who stated that this type of detention should be a last resort.  For the most part, when young people who are 17 or 18 years old get into trouble, local services should be able to work with them and, one hopes, keep them out of detention.  Unfortunately, however, there always will be a need for some places because we have serious and serial violent offenders, and detention unfortunately is the only place for the vast majority of those offenders.  However, the Government must continue to invest to make sure people are given every opportunity to have that second or third chance, or whatever it might be.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I, again, thank all Senators for their support for the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#Q00300","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#R00250","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Next Friday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#R00275","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Friday, 11 December 2015.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Courts Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage","time":1449493200,"counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#R00400"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":42,"content":"<p><\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I move: \"That Second Stage be taken now.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#R00600","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Courts Bill 2015: Second Stage","time":1449493200,"counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#R00800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce the Courts Bill 2015 to the House and look forward to engaging with Members as we progress the Bill through the various Stages.  It is brief in content, having just one single purpose, to provide for an increase in the maximum number of High Court judges from 35 to 37.  Under Article 36 of the Constitution, the number of judges of the different courts is fixed from time to time by legislation.  The existing cap on the number of ordinary judges of the High Court was set in 2007 by the Courts and Court Officers (Amendment) Act.  As is the case with the Bill before the House, that Act amended the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 by providing that there would be no more than 35 ordinary judges of the High Court.  Earlier I looked at the OECD figures for the proportion of judges to the population.  Ireland is very low down in that OECD comparison, although people sometimes erroneously think it is not.<\/p> <p>The best part of a decade has passed since the last adjustment of the statutory number of High Court judges.  I am sure Senators will acknowledge the growth in that period of time, as in so many other areas, in the volume and complexity of proceedings and litigation before the courts system as a whole.  While the pressure on the courts has been managed very effectively and professionally by the Judiciary and the Courts Service, in some important areas of High Court business waiting times are longer than any of us would want them to be.  The allocation of a further two judges to the High Court is not solely about addressing waiting times, although this measure will address, in particular, the waiting times being experienced in the Central Criminal Court.  In fact, it is more to do with ensuring the court can work more efficiently, for example, by reducing the number of reserved judgements handed down.  I will return to the position in the Central Criminal Court and the question of reserved judgments.<\/p> <p>A separate problem that I cannot overlook relates to the changes in the High Court due to the setting up the Court of Appeal and the recent loss of a significant number of judges from the High Court.  Some of this loss is, of course, accounted for by retirements but much of it is due to the fact that we have set up the new Court of Appeal, to which nine High Court judges were appointed to ensure the Court of Appeal would be up and running.  Senators will be aware of the significant work that has been done in the past year and the numbers of cases that have been dealt with by the Court of Appeal under the presidency of Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan.  It has been really effective in dealing with the various cases referred to it and made a lot of headway.  These judges have been replaced by a strong cohort of new judges, but, clearly, I must make the point about the huge loss of experience.  Another point that will be of interest to Senators concerns the huge number of cases now taken by lay litigants.  This is an option people are choosing to take, but it is also leading to cases taking far more time to deal with for obvious reasons.  <\/p> <p>All of these factors are leading to increased waiting times for cases to be heard in some areas of the courts and an increase in the number of cases not proceeding on days listed for hearing, as well as a significant number of reserved judgments.  For these reasons, I asked the Government to approve additional resources.  The actual provision is just a net change in numbers and amends section 9 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, as amended by the Courts and Court Officers (Amendment) Act 2007, to increase the number of ordinary judges of the High Court from 35 to 37.   <\/p> <p>It is worth looking at some of the changes we are seeing in the courts in terms of their business that underline the business case for the assignment of two more judges.   Pressure points in the High Court that the Bill will substantially alleviate include the number of cases in which reserved judgments are given.  While there are good reasons for reserving judgments in many cases, giving judges time to reflect on evidence and the law, the amount is of particular concern to the Judiciary.  Clearly, this can be most unsatisfactory from the point of view of all concerned, not least the parties to the action or matter in hand.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Reserved judgments are frequently handed down in judicial review matters, commercial court cases and chancery actions.  The increase in the number of reserved judgments can perhaps be seen as an unintended consequence of the efforts being made by the Judiciary to stay on top of waiting lists across the various areas of court business.  In the Central Criminal Court, a marked trend is the increasing duration of trials due to the greater complexity of evidence coming before the court.  This is evident in a lot of areas, including in the work of Tusla in relation to child protection cases.  <\/p><p>Waiting times are a matter of concern.  I note that the President of the High Court recently found it necessary to appoint a fifth judge to the full-time hearing of cases in the Central Criminal Court.  I regret to say that currently the waiting time for a trial is approximately 18 months.  One can only imagine the difficulties and distress this causes for victims of crime and their families.  In many instances, cases cannot proceed on the date listed for trial, which then has implications in terms of costs, practitioners and witnesses.  I am concerned about this but I anticipate that the allocation of an additional judge to that court will make a difference.  Two additional judges in the High Court would be very supportive.  <\/p><p>Medical negligence litigation now represents a sizeable portion of business before the High Court.  Given the lengthy duration of most of these actions, which we read about frequently in the newspapers and on which issue we had a discussion during our debate on the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, the President of the High Court, as I am sure everybody here will agree, makes a convincing case for the deployment of judicial resources to manage these actions at the earliest possible opportunity.  Early intervention by a judge offers the best prospect of limiting the duration of hearings through early identification of the issues, which can lead to earlier settlement.  These are usually very upsetting cases for families and all concerned.  Better and more proactive management of these cases would make a difference to everybody.  For this reason, the pre-action protocols to which Senators agreed during our Committee Stage debate on the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 is an important initiative.<\/p><p>The new Companies Act is predicted to generate an increased level of company-law-related applications to the High Court.  These applications, many of which relate to the restriction for directors of insolvent companies, can take a number of days of court time and it is estimated that at least one extra High Court judge will be required to manage this business.  The more effective the operation of our courts system, the better it is for our economy.  It is important in the context of our reputation, economically and internationally, that we have a court system that is effective and efficient.  Judicial reviews of decisions of courts and other bodies where reliefs and remedies are sought arise frequently in such areas as planning matters, challenges to the constitutionality of legislation and debt and other cases.  It is a critical area of activity for the court, and more judicial resources are needed because practically all judicial reviews require written judgments.  The point regarding the importance of written judgments and the time required in that regard has been repeatedly made to me.<\/p><p>I hope Senators can support this Bill, which I believe will have a positive impact on the work and output of the High Court.  I believe it will help with the efficient conduct of business in our courts.  It is important that access to justice is seen to be efficient and timely and that there are not lengthy waiting times in this regard.  While the Bill is a response to the volume of cases coming before the High Court, including judicial reviews, medical negligence actions, asylum applications and company-law-related applications, its specific benefit will be to enhance the efficiency with which the business of the court is managed as a whole and how, in particular, judgments are handled.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It ties in with the establishment of the Court of Appeal last year, which was probably the biggest single reform we have seen in the courts over a long period.

Perhaps she would like to return here again.  By and large, Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill, the purpose of which is to appoint two additional judges to the High Court following a significant increase in the caseload of the court.  Fianna F&aacute;il is also committed to the reform of the judicial appointments system and has published legislation to provide for such reform.<\/p><p>There is no doubt there is an increase in the workload and the increase in civil litigation has clogged up the High Court.  The Minister rightly pointed out that there seems to be a considerable increase in the number of lay litigants.  I am not sure whether that is the right road to go down.  People are entitled to be heard in any court but in some instances frivolous and vexatious procedures by certain lay litigants can clog up the system.  Perhaps there is a way to identify the important issues that require judicial attention rather than those that are not appropriate to any court.<\/p><p>My colleague in the other House, Deputy Niall Collins, published a Bill last year proposing to reform the law in respect of the appointment and promotion of persons to judicial office.  At present, the law simply requires the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to recommend to the Minister for Justice and Equality at least seven persons for appointment to the judicial office in question and the Minister may or may not accept the recommendation.  Under the Judicial Appointments Bill 2014, a new judicial appointments board would be established and the existing board abolished.  Instead of recommending seven persons for appointment to judicial office, the board would recommend for appointment by the Government one candidate whom it would certify as the best candidate for appointment to the judicial office in question.  The name of the candidate would then be communicated to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In the event of the Government not accepting the recommendation, it would be required to publish in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>and on the Department&rsquo;s website reasons the recommendation was not being accepted.  At that stage it would also have to publish the written recommendation of the judicial appointment board promoting the appointment of the person in question.  The new board, as suggested by Deputy Niall Collins under the Bill, would be made up of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court, the Attorney General, a nominee of the Bar Council of Ireland, a nominee of the Law Society of Ireland, a person appointed by the Minister and a person appointed by the National Consumer Agency.<\/p><p>Leaving that aside, as it is a boat floated by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and Deputy Niall Collins, it is very important to note that in January 2014 a committee of judges called for a radical overhaul of the judicial appointments process, saying a merit-based system that limits the Government&rsquo;s scope to reward political allies is vital to retain public confidence in the judicial system.  The judges were sharply critical of a &ldquo;demonstrably deficient system&rdquo; and said wide-ranging changes were needed to attract high-calibre applicants.  They said political allegiance should have no bearing on appointments to judicial office.  They also made the point that, &ldquo;It is increasingly clear that the relative success of the administration of justice in Ireland has been achieved in spite of rather than because of the appointment system&rdquo;.  The judges also said the changes to public and private pension provisions for entrants to the Judiciary may have little fiscal benefit to the State yet create a wholly disproportionate disincentive to applicants for judicial posts and deter high quality applicants from seeking appointment.<\/p><p>The views of the State&rsquo;s 154 judges are contained in a joint submission to the Department of Justice and Equality which was carrying out a public consultation on ways to reform the appointments process.  The judges are critical of the flawed and deficient consultation issued by the then Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter.  It is very difficult not to take on board some of what the entire body of the judges of this country from the various courts &ndash; Circuit Court, District Court, High Court and so forth - said, but leaving all that aside, as we might never get a utopian system, as someone who has practised law for upwards of 30 years, my view is that by and large most of the judges I encountered at various levels from the Supreme Court all the way down to the District Court were pretty decent, pretty efficient and pretty good so the system in some way works well.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Denis O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1988\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1988&amp;amp;pid=DenisODonovan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One must not ignore, however, the criticism of the entire body of judges who are somewhat disappointed regarding how appointments are made.  In this regard, I have no doubt that there is a deficit of judges in the High Court.  The new Court of Appeal will be another layer of the Judiciary, which is needed.  There is much intrinsic work in civil and appeal cases.  The Minister referred to judicial reviews which take much time.  Perhaps ours is beginning to become like the American system, where people want to litigate rather than mediate.  The Bill's proposals are reasonable and I fully support them.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House.

I also welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality back to the House.  The Minister quoted one statistic we need to bear in mind, namely, the fact hat the number of judges in Ireland, per head of population, is well below the international average.  It is appropriate that we increase the number of judges, given that the people voted for the creation of the Court of Appeal in a referendum last year.  Furthermore, many more individuals are taking cases to court than would have done so previously.  Again, this is to be welcomed.  I noted last week a judge speaking about ensuring that the courts are accessible to ordinary people and that legal fees structures and so forth are not a barrier to somebody who feels aggrieved in looking for a remedy in the courts.  The Government is doing its part to deal with this by means of the Legal Services Regulation Bill, which is currently going through the Houses.  We all have to strive to ensure that just because one does not have resources, does not mean the remedies available through the courts system are not available to the individual.<\/p> <p>One must look at the accessibility issue in terms of time.  It is ridiculous that many cases take years to get through the courts system.  That is simply because we do not have enough judges and did not have a Court of Appeal.  The Government has a long record in respect of tackling these issues, which includes the referendum on judges&rsquo; pay and the introduction of the Legal Services Regulation Bill.  This is the first time there has been any meaningful effort made to deal with the entire issue of the cost of legal services.<\/p> <p>As more people go to the courts to seek remedies, we may be back here again to increase the numbers of judges.  I would not have an issue with this because accessibility is not just about cost but also about time.  For example, if an old person feels he or she has not been justly treated when he or she goes to court, he or she could be deceased before his or her case is heard.  As a result, such an individual might never obtain the remedy to which he or she may have been justifiably entitled.<\/p> <p>We must be cognisant of facilitating judges to be professional about how they do their business.  There is no point having judges working 60 to 80 hours per week.  I know District Court judges who work late into the evening to clear backlogs.

I thank her for introducing this Bill in the Seanad.  It is good to see a justice Bill being introduced in this House.  This is one of the shortest justice Bill with which we have had to deal.  As the Minister said, it is simple and straightforward legislation to allow for an expansion in the number of judges to be appointed at High Court level from 35 to a maximum of 37.  So far it has received cross-party and unanimous support and I imagine it will continue to receive such support.  It is unarguable that the waiting times are too long, particularly in the Central Criminal Court, where, as the Minister said, people have to wait up to 18 months for trials to take place.  There are difficulties where trials are ready to proceed and where at the last minute they have to be adjourned.  That is most unfortunate and difficult to deal with, particularly for the victims of crime and their families.  It is also very difficult for those accused of crimes, for those who are detained in custody and for anyone involved as witnesses and so on.  Clearly, that needs to be tackled.  We have seen, as the Minister said, a tackling of waiting times and delays at other levels, and real progress has been made there.<\/p> <p>I want to mention the Court of Appeal.  As the Minister said, real progress has been made in tackling the lengthy time spent waiting for appeals from the High Court.  While the appointment of the new judges to the Court of Appeal has had a significant impact in terms of removing very experienced judges from the High Court, it has made real inroads in tackling the delays in waiting for appeals from the High Court.  That is most welcome.  From talking to practitioners, I know how much more efficient that process has become.  People know now that they will not be waiting years for appeals from the High Court.  It has had the impact that the Minister mentioned.  Again, I know from speaking to colleagues in the legal profession that there is real concern about the loss of judicial experience from the High Court.  Clearly, there is a very strong cohort of new judges on the High Court, which has been an inevitable consequence of the Court of Appeal.  It has also been an issue in terms of judges for the Central Criminal Court.  As the Minister pointed out, there has been a particular assignment of judges to the Central Criminal Court and the raising of the number by two more in this instance will enable that to be confirmed, and that is very welcome.<\/p> <p>We have seen other examples of good practice in terms of increasing efficiency.  The commercial court was mentioned and there have been great improvements in case management there.  That is a lesson for us in terms of how things can be improved.  The Minister mentioned the amendment she put down to the Legal Services Regulation Bill, the welcome amendment on medical negligence pre-action protocols which should lead to more efficient and effective case management.  <\/p> <p>We, as Labour Party Senators, put down a Private Members' motion on the issue of the State Claims Agency in this House dealing with how it operates and how, where the State is a defendant in negligent actions, there can be issues in terms of an overly adversarial and confrontational approach which can exacerbate distress for litigants or their families.  We called for an examination of how the State Claims Agency runs those cases.  In response to that we were told that a review of the work of the agency is under way.  I very much welcome that and I hope the review will lead to greater efficiencies in the processing of claims and that we will not see unnecessary delays where claims are ultimately being settled.  Clearly, there should be more of a focus on seeking to facilitate settlement.  <\/p> <p>The Minister also mentioned projected increases in litigation, for example, around the new companies legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There has been a huge increase in the volume of judicial review legislation in recent years and the number of lay litigants, as the Minister said.  This will lead to great pressure on the High Court.  Therefore, there cannot be a difficulty with the appointment of two additional judges.  There have been many reasons in all of these areas for the increase in the volume of cases before the courts, to which we need a speedy response, which the Bill represents.<\/p><p>I support Senator Jillian van Turnhout's comments about family courts.  I very much welcome the developments the Minister mentioned in bringing forward changes to family court sittings.  Clearly, that is an area in which there could be greater efficiencies and better case management.  <\/p><p>I welcome this straightforward Bill, to which there cannot be any opposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#V00300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur ar an mBille seo.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not oppose the legislation, the purpose of which is to address the problems associated with the significant increase in the number of cases coming before the High Court, including judicial reviews, medical negligence cases, asylum applications and company law-related applications.  However, it would prove more fruitful to tackle the causes of these problems before they reach court.  Inaccurate measurement and mapping continue to cause more property disputes to come before the courts.  Newly digitised property boundaries are not the same as paper maps.  This means the efficiency savings associated with digitisation are absent.  Landowners cannot trust newly digitised boundaries, instead having to physically check boundaries on the ground, which entails the cost of employing qualified and competent surveyors.  As a result, digitisation receives unjust criticism, although not surprisingly, given this incompetent and rushed panacea at the behest of the Government.  Time and democratic scrutiny are essential to ensure flawed procedures and regulations are not endorsed by the Houses.<\/p> <p>With regard to medical negligence cases, the culture of defend and deny results in more cases going to court and, ultimately, more tax revenue being used by the State on legal fees.  Sinn F&eacute;in encourages mediation in a calmer and less adversarial manner to address the lengthy traumatic, unwieldy and, ultimately, highly expensive medical negligence legal system.  We have consistently advocated on the need for the mediation Bill to be brought forward, but it languishes somewhere in the Department of Justice and Equality, expeditiously abandoned for electoral purposes.<\/p> <p>The Special Criminal Court is not a symbol of success but a concrete example of failure.  The fact that accused citizens can be convicted of an offence not on specific evidence but on the word of individual garda&iacute; and the secret submission of \"evidence\" that is not open for the defendant to examine and refute is offensive to all democratic sensibilities.  The court is entirely unacceptable and should be closed.  <\/p> <p>Meaningful change can be achieved in the court system by introducing a sentencing council in the State.  Such a council operates in other jurisdictions and provides sentencing guidelines for the judiciary.  This has ensured sentences handed down for criminal offences in their courts are consistent and accountable across the board.  Concern has arisen in recent years about the perceived inconsistency of sentencing in the courts here.  Sentences handed down for sexual offences have been of particular concern and controversy.  Sinn F&eacute;in has examined other sentencing council models and believes this model of consistency and accountability should be introduced in the State.  A key strength is that the models involves a range of key stakeholders such as victim support groups, academics, senior police officers, senior parole officers and the public in the process of establishing sentencing guidelines for the judiciary.  As members of the judiciary are the majority members of the sentencing council and a senior member of the judiciary chairs the council, they are still central to the process.  However, the guidelines issued ensure members of the judiciary must stick to the range provided for the category of offence before them.  They must also clearly indicate why they have sentenced an offender within that range taking into consideration the impact on the victim and the blameworthiness of the offender.  This ensures consistency and accountability across the court system and the state.<\/p> <p>Ba mhaith liom go dt&oacute;gfadh an tAire sin ar bord agus go nd&eacute;anfadh s&iacute; macnamh faoi na molta&iacute; breise at&aacute; d&eacute;anta againn.

I welcome the Minister of State and thank his officials for their engagement with me on some of the issues I have with this Bill.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 10 is concerned with the best interests of the child.  Article 3.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child outlines that &quot;In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.&quot;  The purpose of this amendment is that the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration rather than the primary or paramount consideration.  That is absolutely critical.  At present, the Bill only refers to the best interests of the child in a limited way, namely, where international protection has been granted upon recognition of the child's status, in the application of a medical examination to determine the age of an unaccompanied minor or in certain aspects of the conduct of protection interviews for unaccompanied minors.  The UNHCR working group recommendation clearly states &quot;The International Protection Bill 2015 should reflect the general principle contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child that the best interests of the child be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children.&quot;  My understanding is that the report was circulated to all Government Departments and the Attorney General.  I am surprised, therefore, that its recommendations were not incorporated into the Bill.  The best interest of the child is defined in detail in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  The courts, in determining the best interests of the child for the purpose of the Act, must consider the physical, emotional, psychological, education and social needs of the child, including his or her need for stability having regard to age and stage of development.  Furthermore, since the list of considerations is not exhaustive, the court can look beyond them when making a determination concerning the child.<\/p><p>I do not advocate that a specific definition of what constitutes the best interest of the child be devised.  I am of the view that the omission of an explicit definition by those who drafted the UN Conventions on the Rights of the Child was intended to allow for the appropriate balance of considerations within what should be well-defined procedural frameworks.  I recall the excellent unpacking of this concept by Emily Logan, then Ombudsman for Children, at the 2008 Janusz Korczak lecture in Stockholm, where she said:<\/p><blockquote>The best interests principle comprises a procedural rule, it governs how we go about decision-making with regard to children.  It is a legally binding rule that States must follow.  The rule does not state that children&rsquo;s interests always come first.  The aim of the rule is not to encroach on the rights of others, but to facilitate an examination of the interests of a vulnerable group.  A child&rsquo;s best interests should be considered in relation to all actions concerning them, that is when the action directly affects them or regards or touches them.<\/blockquote> <p>I understand there are concerns that amendment No. 10 - which suggests that the best interests of the child be a primary consideration - could conflict with some of Ireland's obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights.  I am confused and concerned by this reasoning but for this reason, I redrafted my proposed amendment.  The best interest of the child is not defined and is certainly not a <i>jus cogens<\/i>principle of international law, from which no derogation is allowed - it is a right subject to consideration and balancing where it competes with other rights.  The European Court of Human Rights has asserted the importance of the child's best interests and has also stressed the importance of reuniting the child with his or her family unless it is not in the child's best interest.  While I do not necessarily agree with the Department's view on this point, in an effort to assuage its concerns, I proposed that the best interest principle be subject to the obligation to comply with international law and conventions, in particular with the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It should also be noted that the best interests of the child is included in the recast asylum procedures directive.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This directive was drafted by EU lawyers with full regard to the European Convention on Human Rights and other legal agreements.  Any conflicts or difficulties are always identified early on.  The directive provides for the best interests in several places.  However, the most relevant for the purpose of the International Protection Bill is Article 23, which cites:<\/p><blockquote>The best interests of the child shall be of primary consideration for member states when implementing the provisions of this directive that involves minors.  Member states shall ensure a standard of living adequate for the minor's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development.<\/blockquote><p>In practice, it is all about interpretation in the Irish system.  In the absence of either a domestic or internationally agreed definition, I have heard it argued that the phrase &quot;the best interests of the child&quot; has no clear meaning in law.  However, the Legislature can choose to deal with this in a variety of ways.  For example, in the Children and Family Relationships Act, the Legislature chose to define what the best interests are, as I cited earlier.  There is a test that the courts must apply when making a decision &quot;in the best interests of children&quot;.  According to the special rapporteur on child protection, the Children and Family Relationships Act includes one of the best definitions in the world.<br\/><br\/>Only last week at the recent Civil Service excellence and innovation awards the Department of Justice and Equality won an award for its work in this area on the best interests of the child.  On the other hand, if we look at the Child and Family Agency Act, the Legislature chose not to define &quot;the best interests of the child&quot; and to leave it to the agency and the courts to interpret.  In the current Bill, the definition could be left to the courts to interpret or the Legislature could define it now.  Another option would be for the Bill to include a clause that the Minister could define the best interests by ministerial order.  Let us remember that the best interests of the child is in the Constitution in Article 42.A.  This is a part of the trend in legislating for children's rights.  If we can implement the best interests of the child in child care and family law settings, why can we not do it for a small group of children in the international protection process?  Why are asylum seeking children always left out in the cold?<br\/><br\/>The second amendment I tabled is No. 49, which relates to Article 37 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is very clear on child detention.  It states, &quot;The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.&quot;  As I said on Second Stage, I have a grave concern around the reading of section 20(1)(c) when read in conjunction with section 20(7).  This is a breach of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child general comment No. 6, which provides that in cases of uncertainty as to the individual's age, the individual should be given the benefit of the doubt and be considered a child.<br\/><br\/>On the presumption of age, the problem is that asylum seekers often do not have access to proof of age, and sometimes may not be certain as to their age.  Many children around the world are not formally registered at birth, although the situation is improving.  I have included, however, an amendment that I feel would raise the low threshold that is in the Bill, that would require the view of an immigration officer or a garda to be supported by a second officer or garda and a requirement to ensure an age assessment is undertaken at the earliest opportunity.  In putting forward the amendments, I very much thank my colleagues in my group, Senators Mac Conghail, Power, O'Donnell, Mary Ann O'Brien and Zappone for their support for the amendments.<br\/><br\/>I understand and appreciate that some NGOs have advocated not to support the Bill.  I do not wish to open up a general discussion on the matter, but I have put forward the amendments to engage robustly and substantively with the Bill.  I believe that change is incremental and this Bill represents the first opportunity in almost ten years to raise the baseline.  Each time we raise that baseline we can hopefully raise it further.  It is my role and responsibility as a legislator to engage actively and fully in the legislative process and to work to secure the necessary changes in the Bill.  Ultimately, the question for me is whether children's rights have been strengthened and whether in my consideration of the Bill the situation for asylum seekers on the whole has been improved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#Y00500","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I wish to put on the record of the House that we have just received a document from the Government regarding the 26 recommendations of the working group that have been included in the Bill.  I am very disappointed that we only received this document this afternoon.  It is quite clear that the Minister of State had this document last Thursday.  The fact it has only been given to us now, once the debate has started, is appalling.  It gives us no chance to study the 26 recommendations in full to determine what has been included or left out.  It shows again the appalling tactics being used by the Government in the debate on this Bill.  The Government was afraid to give us this document last week in case we came back today and argued against those elements of the Bill with which we are unhappy.  It is deplorable that we are only seeing this document now.<\/p><p>I also wish to put on the record the fact that we received a statement over the weekend from four NGOs regarding this Bill.  I hope we will not hear sweeping statements from those on the Government side to the effect this Bill has the full support of the NGO sector because the opposite is the case.  The four NGOs which issued the statement are key in this area.  They are fully supportive of a single protection process that will work effectively but they have outlined a number of serious concerns with the Bill which I will refer to as the debate progresses.  <\/p><p>In the particular grouping of amendments under discussion, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed amendments Nos. 36 and 215.  The former reads as follows: <\/p><blockquote>In page 20, line 27, after &ldquo;understand&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, including, where appropriate, an information leaflet written in a child friendly manner&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>We believe it is important where the application for protection is for or by a child that information regarding law and procedures should be understandable to the child concerned.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 215 reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote>In page 57, line 37, to delete &ldquo;<i>sections 52 <\/i>to <i>56<\/i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the <i>International Protection Act 2015<\/i>&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>The current provision, as has been outlined, is contrary to Ireland's obligations under the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child as it only extends to children once they have been granted protection status.  There is also just limited reference to &quot;the best interests of the child&quot; in the context of the personal interview but it should be a primary principle throughout the process.  Under Article 22 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Ireland is obliged to take appropriate measures to ensure that a child who is seeking refugee status or who is considered a refugee &quot;shall, whether unaccompanied or accompanied by his or her parents or by any other person, receive appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance in the enjoyment of applicable rights set forth in the present Convention&quot;.  Furthermore, the recast asylum procedures directive calls on states, in assessing the best interests of the child, to take due account of the minor's well-being and social development, including his or her background.  The proposed amendment would ensure that the best interests of the child are paramount throughout the protection process.<\/p><p>I commend the various NGOs for assisting us in the formulation of amendments to the Bill.  The Irish Refugee Council made numerous recommendations on the International Protection Bill 2015 and outlined a number of serious concerns with the legislation.  The main concerns include the failure to embed the principle of &quot;the best interests of the child&quot; and the associated weaknesses which will potentially expose children to harm; the lack of protection in the single application procedure against error and omission and, therefore, the risk that wrong decisions will be made without adequate checks and balances and a right of redress; and the lack of respect for the rights of refugees to obtain family reunification.  The council outlines a number of other concerns in its submission.  It believes the best interests of the child, as declared in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, are a paramount consideration for both accompanied and separated children seeking international protection. Correspondingly, Ireland, as a state party to the aforementioned convention, must uphold its commitments to promote and respect children's rights in a non-discriminatory manner, including in the context of children seeking protection here, whether accompanied or separated.  Currently, the Bill only refers in a limited way to &quot;the best interests of the child&quot; principle in the context of the content of international protection granted on recognition of a child's status in section 57(2).  That is why the council has recommended that a new provision be included in the Bill reflecting this overarching obligation to respect the rights of the child.  <\/p><p>Nasc Ireland, the Irish Immigration Support Centre, has also been in contact with us to highlight the fact that the general comment No. 6 of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child states that asylum seeking children, including those who are unaccompanied or separated, &quot;shall enjoy access to asylum procedures and other complimentary mechanisms&quot; providing international protection, irrespective of age.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Nasc recommendations continue as follows:<\/p><blockquote>As it stands, under Section 15(3) of the Bill, a person who makes an application for protection under subsection (1)(a) 'shall be deemed to also have made an application for international protection on behalf of his or her dependent child where the child is not an Irish citizen', under certain criteria outlined in Section 15(3)(a-c).  This is counter to the rights of the child to make a separate protection application on their own behalf.  Amending Section 15(3) to clearly articulate that right, it will also remove any potential conflict with Head 7(2)f, which makes explicit reference to acts of persecution of a child-specific nature.<\/blockquote><p>I have a serious problem with the failure of the Bill to address issues of child care and protection, particularly in respect of direct provision.  The legislation offers an opportunity to provide some light and hope in respect of addressing issues relating to direct provision.  I agreed with everything the Minister of State said during a Seanad debate on direct provision on 22 January 2015.  For example, he stated, &quot;Hand on heart, as an asylum seeker, I could see myself spending a period of weeks or months in some centres but there were some in which I would not like to spend a night.&quot;  Later, speaking about a man he met in a direct provision centre in Limerick, he made the following comments:<\/p><blockquote>As a society, system and country we have compounded his misery and broken him and I do not know if he will ever be repaired.  I feel keenly that we have a responsibility to him, and also to children, who have been broken by the situation in which they find themselves.  On my visits I noticed children playing a game called kitchen in the play spaces provided in direct provision centres.  When they were playing they looked for an orange dispenser in the toy because that is the only way they know to get orange juice.  It has never been given to them by their mother and they do not know about food preparation.  Therefore, it is very disconcerting for me to see that this country still persists in prolonging its love affair with incarceration [that is the word the Minister of State used].  Apparently in the 1950s we had 250,000 people in mental institutions.  Ireland also has a history of mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries and an industrial schools system, yet again we revert to incarcerating and storing people while they wait for their asylum applications to be processed.<\/blockquote><p>I fully agreed with the Minister of State when he spoke those words in the Chamber in January.  I am disappointed, therefore, that none of these issues concerning the rights of children has been addressed in the Bill and I do not have any hope that they will be.  I speak daily to people who work with those in direct provision.  This is a missed opportunity.<br\/><br\/>I call on Senators to consider refusing to support the Bill because it is being used as a Trojan horse to introduce measures that will row back on the human rights provisions in existing legislation.  Senators should not be swayed by an amendment here or there because, as four non-governmental organisations stated over the weekend, the Bill gives rise to serious issues.  It should be withdrawn at this stage.  While we accept certain provisions on the single procedure, a large amount of work remains to be done on the remainder of the Bill, which Sinn F&eacute;in is unable to support in its current form.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#AA00100","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome this opportunity to resume our debate on the Bill and to discuss Committee Stage amendments.  I hope it will be possible to consider including more references in the text to the best interests of the child as a primary consideration.  I am conscious that this is provided for in a number of sections.  It is clearly set out in section 24 dealing with the examination to determine the age of unaccompanied minors, section 35 dealing with applicants who are unaccompanied minors, and section 57 dealing with the vulnerable persons.  I am conscious that this important phrase is already specifically spelled out in some provisions of the Bill.  All Senators will also be aware of the constitutional provision on the rights of the child to which all legislation is subject.  That must be said.<\/p> <p>Notwithstanding this, I support, in principle, Senator van Turnhout's attempt to ensure that this consideration is adhered to or emphasised throughout the Bill.  We should try to find some way to achieve this objective.  I am conscious that the Bill must go through all Stages in the D&aacute;il, which means there may be time to consider whether it would be useful or effective to place further specific reference to that consideration in other provisions of the Bill.  As I stated, it is specifically outlined in the three sections that make what may be the three most relevant provisions.<\/p> <p>Senator van Turnhout and the other Senators who tabled amendments are engaging constructively to ensure the Bill is improved upon, which is welcome.

In its note on the Bill, dated 30 November, the Irish Refugee Council states: \"The Irish Refugee Council supports the introduction of new legislation in this field given previous attempts to legislate dating back almost ten years and agrees that a new application procedure is needed as soon as possible\".<\/p><p>Let us not have posturing on this issue.  This is the first attempt in ten years to raise the baseline in a flawed and problematic process.  Clearly, there is a great deal more to be done, even just in terms of the working group's recommendations on direct provision.  However, direct provision is only one part of our immigration and legal framework which, as I said, needs a great deal more reform.  Let us recall that in the four or five years of the previous Government it made tortuous attempts to bring forward an overarching immigration, residence and protection Bill but failed to do so.  This Bill only deals with a small part of the issue - international protection.  It will greatly improve matters for those who will seek asylum in the future by providing for a single unified procedure and for those in the direct provision system by ensuring people will not be left languishing for long periods of time.  <\/p><p>All of us, across parties, have spoken about the need to reform the direct provision system and to end it in its current form, in which delay is the biggest problem.  The recommendation of the working group was early enactment and implementation of a single procedure, by way of the International Protection Bill.  That deals with one of the biggest issues in the direct provision system - the long period of time spent in it, with children growing up knowing of no other life but living in direct provision accommodation.  Let us agree on that much.  I cannot understand how any NGO can suggest the Bill does not represent an improvement on the current procedure.  There is a lot more to be done, but let us engage constructively to improve the provisions of the Bill.<\/p><p>I have spoken openly about the speed with which we are getting through the Bill and the fact that there are so many Government amendments so soon after publication, albeit most of them are not substantive and are relatively technical, relating to a change of name.  Clearly, the Bill is not ideal, yet it represents a significant improvement and is long overdue.  It is most unfortunate, therefore, that we are now hearing people calling for it to be withdrawn or seeing them protest outside Leinster House, saying \"Kill the Bill.\"   If that happens, when will we see it back in the House?  Let us be honest about it.  We know that we have limited time left in the lifetime of the Government.  Let us try to get the Bill through, improve it as it goes through, engage constructively on it with the Government to seek to bring about the other recommendations of the working group as they relate to direct provision and work towards the future overarching immigration law reform we so badly need.

However, I am not happy with it and have tabled reams of amendments.  I understand it has to pass through this House and all I am asking is that the Minister of State and his officials allow for certain improvements by way of amendments within the framework of the Bill, without destroying it and what it is trying to achieve.  I am also not entirely happy that debate on the Bill is to be guillotined at 7 p.m.  That is regrettable because when we returned after the summer recess in September, there wre five or six weeks in which we twiddled our thumbs because little legislation was brought through to us for consideration.  There was the same situation last year and it is most regrettable that we are now sitting late hours and five days a week.

I will first make some general comments about some of the contributions that have been made.  I have to concur with much of what Senator Bacik has said.  This legislation is trying to clean up an area of public policy that has robustly failed over quite a prolonged period.  We have had a Bill kicking around the place for 12 to 15 years.  Finally, we have taken the protection piece out of that legislation in order to ensure that new applicants have a more transparent and quicker protection process.  The biggest problem with our system has been identified.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh seems to be confusing this Bill with a direct provision Bill.  This is not a direct provision Bill.  Last week he wanted to abolish direct provision, with no sense of how he was going to house thousands of asylum seekers.  He would just leave them go homeless and put them on the housing lists, I suppose, with no provision whatsoever for them.  Now he is trying to conflate the two issues again.  I stand over absolutely everything I said that the Senator has just quoted back to me, and more.<\/p> <p>This protection Bill is an effort to ensure that we do not have people languishing in direct provision for years on end, or children growing up in it.  That is the whole point of the exercise.  I will attest to the recommendations of the working group on the protection system, which reported not just on direct provision but on the whole system.  That was the whole point of the working group.  I hate to remind Senators, but about 4,000 people who are seeking asylum here are not in direct provision.<\/p> <p>\"The early enactment and implementation of a single procedure by way of the International Protection Bill as a matter of urgency,\" is one recommendation in the report.  Another is: \"As an additional safeguard, an annual review of the system with a view to making recommendations to guard against any future backlogs...\".  Both recommendations are covered in the general aims of the Bill.  The report also states: \"The review should also look at the option of reducing the five year mark in future years as appropriate.\"  That is in the general aims of the Bill.  It also states: \"Where the State does not opt-in to an instrument for discrete reasons [...], the State should give full effect to the remaining provisions in order to safeguard important common standards and to promote consistency in the application of protection procedures and standards across the EU.\"  Again, that is in the Bill.  \"The International Protection Bill 2015 should reflect the general principle contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child\"; that is outlined here as well.  \"The International Protection Bill should clearly provide that all children have the right to lodge an application for international protection\"; that is provided for in sections 14, 15, 34, 35 and 57.  \"In relation to separated children, work should be undertaken to clarify the position with regard to access to the protection process in practice and age assessment procedures\"; that is provided for in sections 14, 24 and 57.  I can go on if the Senators wish me to do so.  \"The International Protection Bill 2015 should be further scrutinised to ensure the rights of the child to be heard are given sufficient expression and protection.\"  That is provided for in sections 14, 15, 24, 34, 35 and 57.  These are all recommendations from the working group report which are dealt with in the Bill.  Remarkably, some NGOs and others have contacted me to say that the working group report is on a shelf somewhere and is not being implemented.  It is the only game and the only document in town.  There is no other document or piece of paper from which anybody in the Department, including myself and the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is working.  That is the document we are using to drive though reforms in this area.<\/p> <p>\"The International Protection Bill 2015 should contain a provision requiring decision-makers who take decisions in relation to children and those who interview them to have received and continue to receive appropriate procedural and substantive training.\"  That is provided for in sections 34 and 35.  More of the recommendations are included in sections 15, 34, 35, 47, 57, 61, 62, 64, 72 and so on.  Twenty-six of the recommendations are provided for.  I might also say that some of these recommendations will make other recommendations null and void.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is because if one gets people out of the system within six months, the entire idea of having access to the labour market after nine months will no longer be relevant, because everyone will have gone through the system by then.  The entire point of what the Government is trying to achieve with this legislation is to ensure the avoidance of the inhumane reality of people living in centres for years on end.  That is the entire point of this protection Bill because, as Members will be aware, the numbers are increasing.  That is a fact, not a value judgment.  While it used to be the case that Ireland dealt with numbers in the hundreds, it now is dealing with numbers in the thousands.  This is simply what is being dealt with and is the way it is.  This year, the number should be something greater than 3,500.  That is not a value judgment; it is simply a statement of fact.  The Government is trying to clean up the system under which there are 34 asylum centres nationwide, and has acknowledged that Ireland must opt into a system from which we previously had an opt-out clause.  We must opt in and accept 4,000 refugees into Ireland because that is the humane thing to do, and meanwhile, an increasing number of people are coming here to claim asylum.  This Bill will enable the Government to deal with that situation in a much more humane and compassionate fashion than has been the case in the past.  I ask the Senator to not confuse the two issues - that is, direct provision and the protection Bill.  I am talking about what the Government is trying to do.  The assumption here is that somehow, within this legislation, the Government can deal with direct provision.  The entire point of this legislation is that people can be assessed quickly, humanely and transparently within a short time in order that they are not obliged to spend endless years in direct provision.  I might also note that it does not matter what conditions are available in direct provision - I absolutely agree they must be robustly changed and improved in many of the centres - because people do not wish to live in them; they want to get a decision on their application.  This is what they seek.<\/p><p>The last point I will make, because the suggestion was that the Government is somehow keeping from people these recommendations and their effect on the Bill, is that officials from the Department worked on that document over the weekend to ensure it was available for Senators today.  The documents were sitting in a pile outside the Chamber when I came in, which some Senators obviously did not notice on their way into the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#DD00200","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>That is because nobody notified Members that it was being made available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#EE00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>On amendment No. 10-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#EE00300","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>The Minister of State himself told Members that this would be given to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#EE00400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>The Minister of State without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#EE00500","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>On amendment No. 10, I unfortunately cannot agree with Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s proposed amendment, which links into the recommendations of the working group.  While the recommendation is desirable and I fully support its intent, the working group did not consider the potential impact on other areas of this Bill, including the fact that the Bill refers to the protection process and certain immigration provisions.  Following extensive legal advice, I am satisfied the provisions in this Bill both ensure the intent of the recommendations and fulfil the policy of a Government that enabled such a protection to be included in the Constitution, as the Senator mentioned.  The Senator&rsquo;s amendments do not legally satisfy the advices the Government has been given and would have unintended consequences beyond the scope intended, which the Government cannot resolve at this Stage.  The Government will continue to explore avenues to reassure all those who rightfully advocate for children&rsquo;s rights that this Bill will ensure the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in the Irish protection process, ensuring that the best practice that already exists in our process will be embedded in the practices that result from the enactment of this Bill.  While the Government was minded to accept this amendment and wished to so do, the advice of the Attorney General was to the contrary.  However, the Government will not leave matters there and will work collectively with the Senator and others to ensure it can go some way towards what Senator van Turnhout is trying to achieve at a further Stage of the Bill.<\/p> <p>I cannot agree with amendment No. 36.  Accompanied children are in the care of an adult who is taking responsibility for their care and protection, while unaccompanied children are in the care of the Child and Family Agency, which has adequate safeguards for the best interests of the child.  I cannot agree with amendment No. 39, as it is appropriate that this legislation provide for the taking of such fingerprints, if necessary, under appropriate supervision.  Unfortunately, I cannot agree to the proposed amendment No. 49.  The appropriate safeguards in this regard already are in place and if there are any doubts with regard to the age of an applicant, the Child and Family Agency is contacted immediately.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and immigration officers are well trained in this area and can be expected to err on the side of caution in dealing with matters in this regard.

It was issued on 4 December and it states:<\/p><blockquote>Doras Luimn&iacute;, the Irish Refugee Council, Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and Nasc are calling for the International Protection Bill, currently before the Seanad, to be withdrawn so that it can be properly amended by the Government and full consideration must be given to concerns expressed by organisations that work directly with asylum seekers and refugees.<\/blockquote> <p>The Minister of State can choose whether to take this on board but this is their latest statement.  They go on to state that:<\/p><blockquote>Proceedings before the Seanad on 3rd December 2015 were described by some Senators as &quot;shambolic&quot; whilst the leader of the Seanad, Senator Maurice Cummins, has criticised the Department of Justice and questioned why the Bill was published given that 90 amendments were then made by the Department within a week.  Despite the criticism and concern, a motion was passed in the Seanad yesterday to bring a guillotine on debates in the Seanad on Monday, with the effect that all amendments will fall if not passed with the exception of those submitted by the Government.  The principal purpose of the Bill is to introduce a single application procedure to reduce the length of time that people applying for international protection spend in this system.  Attempts have been made to bring in such a procedure for more than ten years.  The Government is now attempting to steamroll this critical piece of legislation within four weeks and without proper debate and scrutiny.<\/blockquote> <p>Sue Conlan, CEO of the Irish Refugee Council, said:<\/p><blockquote>A single procedure will not cure the problems in the Irish asylum system unless there are proper safeguards in place which protect asylum seekers from cursory examination of their applications and a swift move towards deportation.  The outcome of passage of the Bill, as it stands, will lead to people being at risk of being returned to persecution or serious harm and refugees separated from family members.  This will be at the time of the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War.<\/blockquote> <p>Fiona Finn, CEO of Nasc, and a member of the Government's Working Group on the Protection Process which reported at the end of June, said:<\/p><blockquote>The Minister claims that the Bill implements the key recommendations of the Working Group, this is simply not true.  With the exception of the single procedure, the Minister has cherry picked a handful of the more conservative recommendations and ignored any positive recommendations, such as the right to work, early identification of vulnerable applicants, and the application of the Best Interests of Child principle for all asylum seeking children.  In addition, the Bill erodes rights to family reunification and brings in harsher detention measures.  The single procedure is necessary to improve the protection system, but not at this cost.<\/blockquote> <p>Leonie Kerins, Director of Doras Luimn&iacute;, commented:<\/p><blockquote>We are extremely concerned with the speed at which the Bill has been progressed.  We see this as a deliberate attempt to prevent proper debate on the more alarming areas of the legislation.  This legislation is an opportunity to address the failures of the current system and to bring Ireland in line with international practice and the Common European Asylum System in particular.<\/blockquote> <p>It is important to put this on the record.  Some Senators are huffing and puffing but what I have outlined is the opinion of those who work in this area every day of the week.

I note that the Irish Refugee Council recommended that section 15(4) be replaced by a new subsection allowing a separated child to make an application for asylum on his or her own behalf.  It notes that such an approach would be in accordance with Article 7 of the recast asylum procedures directive and Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as following a recommendation made in the working group's report.  In this regard, the council also noted comment No. 6 of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which refers to the necessary procedural safeguards required for an unaccompanied child to seek international protection.<\/p><p>The rationale for the amendment is that the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, should consult an independent legal representative to identify whether international protection should be applied for on behalf of a separated child.  The current provision does not require the Child and Family Agency to receive independent legal advice when considering applying for protection on behalf of a separated child.  The decision is left at the sole discretion of the Child and Family Agency which may operate in a manner that is contrary to the child's individual right to asylum, as guaranteed under Article 18 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.<\/p><p>Given the implications for the child and the complexity of asylum law which encompass persecution of a child-specific nature, it is important that legal representatives with expertise in child and asylum law be consulted in making this important decision.  The role of the social worker should include the facilitation of access to legal advice and the asylum procedure for separated children.  The Child and Family Agency should regularly review the personal circumstances and protection needs of children in its care to establish whether an application for international protection is necessary.

We believe that should be considered also, but we specified nine months in the amendment because that length of time is more likely to be agreed given its support among EU member states and the relevant NGOs.

It is totally frustrating and some of them say it is soul destroying that this right is not given to them.  The Minister of State needs to do the bold thing here.  While I am sure he is being advised by the Department and the officials not to move on this, we have been waiting for it for years.

It is very important that we acknowledge and build on their capacity.

It is a little disingenuous to state that there are people within the system who might be abused or whatever in work scenarios.  What the right to work confers literally is a right to work.  It does not confer a job or force people into employment, and it does not take away a job from anybody else.  It simply means the person who is seeking asylum has the right to compete for a job in the same way as anybody else.  This is an absolutely fundamental international human right that is being denied to asylum seekers in this country.  Moreover, we have been denying it for a long time, since long before the present Administration came to office.  It is a fundamental bedrock of international human rights that must be put in place.  We are way out of kilter with the rest of Europe and best international practice on this issue.  The Minister of State is aware of this, and when one can see that very little has been acted upon until now, promises of what might be done in the future do not cut it with people who are in the asylum system.

There is no suggestion from this side of the House that there should be any compulsion for people to work.  It is about the right to work.  I am rather sad to observe the Minister of State, who I know to be a decent and open-hearted man, coming into the Chamber to defend these completely indefensible positions.  The Irish Refugee Council, which was consulted about this issue, made a series of recommendations, only a few of the most conservative of which were cherry-picked.  I apologise to Members if it already has been read into the record, but the recommendation made on this issue was:<\/p><blockquote>[T]hat provision for access to the labour market for protection applicants who are awaiting a first instance decision for nine months or more, and who have cooperated with the protection process (under the relevant statutory provisions), should be included in the ... International Protection Bill and should be commenced when the single procedure is operating efficiently.  This recommendation ... takes account of the fact that, under the current statutory arrangements, first instance decisions in respect of refugee status and subsidiary protection do not (in the normal course) issue within nine months at present.<\/blockquote> <p>That is clear and unambiguous.  There is nothing about people being forced to work or anything remotely like that.  The council suggested an amendment, which I will not go into because I am sure it has been tabled and it may be one of the amendments Members are considering at present.  However, the Irish Refugee Council has suggested amendments to the section that would permit people to work.  I consider such suggestions to be astonishing.<\/p><p>I must state, as a matter of general principle, that this is what happens when one gets legislation that is hurried in draftsmanship, which obviously is what has happened given the number of amendments, and rushed through the Seanad in the couple of weeks before Christmas.  I have been a Member for nearly 30 years and have seen this every single bloody year, and I am fed up to my back teeth with it.  It is bad legislative procedure and is bad for democracy.  However, I believe this is the worst Members ever have seen.  There was a previous Bill that had 300 amendments.  It is just dreadful.<\/p><p>I will not go on because I am sure Members already have spoken on it but, on the amendment itself, it seems clear to me that people should have the right to work.  That was the recommendation of the Irish Refugee Council.  Why have such a council and why bother consulting it if the Government does not take a blind bit of notice of what it proposes?<\/p><p>I introduced a Bill to address direct provision and the Minister gave undertakings about direct provision.  It would be a dreadful comment on our society if greater rights are provided for asylum seekers who are brought in under this scheme than for those people who already are here and in direct provision.  This point also must be addressed.  I genuinely acknowledge that the Minister of State has sincere and deep feelings on this matter but, really, these issues must be addressed.  Members only have a short time left, as it was being suggested today on the wireless that the Government might call the election straight away and not return after Christmas.  I do not know whether that is true, but if it is, Members certainly are dealing with a rushed package and that simply is bad.  Perhaps the Government does not trust whatever incoming Government may follow it to deal with these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#TT00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#UU00100","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I beg your pardon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#UU00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#UU00300","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Well, there you are.

Since then, regardless of the number of visits I have made to individual centres, we made two cast-iron commitments in the statement of Government priorities at that time.

Amendment No. 31 proposes to insert the following lines on page 19, between lines 29 and 30, &quot;reporting requirements shall be subject to review taking into account the personal circumstances of an applicant seeking international protection and maintaining flexibility in relation to those personal circumstances&quot;.  This, again, is a practical amendment.  It has been recommended that some flexibility be maintained in reporting requirements and the possibility to periodically review the reporting requirements depending on the personal circumstances of a protection applicant.  For example, if an applicant for international protection is heavily pregnant, the reporting requirements to present at a specified Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na station should be lifted.  I am aware of an example in this regard.  I do not want to indicate the area where it took place because I do not want to reveal who are the people involved.  I refer to the case of a number of school-going children who are involved in a sports club locally as part of an effort to integrate with the local community.  They are particularly good and it is a high-performance club.  As part of their activities, children from the club will travel to another European country to take part in an international sports competition.  However, the two young people to whom I refer are precluded from travelling as a result of the issue to which amendment No. 31 relates.  This is something that can frustrate those seeking asylum, particularly younger people.  There is a great deal of talk about treating all of the children equally but we do not see this happening in practice.  There are situations where people find it very difficult to travel and can only do so at the behest of the Minister.  This is a small but important amendment.  I cannot see what issue the Minister of State would have with this.  I am sure he will take it on board and possibly accept it in the good faith in which it is being put forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#YY00400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I call Senator Norris.

I wonder whether this Government will take on board amendment No. 31.  To my astonishment, it has refused to accept amendments relating to taking the best interests of children into account.  I must say to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, through the Chair, that if the Government is not prepared to take the best interests of children into account, it is a bit naive to expect it to have regard to the personal circumstances of an applicant because there seems to be something ruthless about the way this legislation is being barged through.  <\/p> <p>I am not sure how many, if any, of these amendments have been accepted.

Therefore, let us formalise it and give it concrete form in legislative terms.<\/p> <p>In another point, I note one example provided by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh was of a pregnant woman.  She could be six months pregnant when she came in here and could be having the child three months later.  My understanding of gynaecology and obstetrics is limited in the extreme but even I understand the human reproductive term.  Another point is that the Minister of State stated a couple of times this will all be through within six months and will be a limited period.  In some ways, this is welcome if it will be an efficient system but it also gives rise to serious concerns about whether it will give reasonable time for manoeuvre for appeal and for all the circumstances to be taken into account.  One does not desire a situation in which everyone happily states they will have six months after which they are gone, bang, back to Iraq or somewhere where they are butchered.  If one accepts, with these reservations, that the six-month period is a good idea - I do not challenge the Minister of State but merely seek information - can he point to a place in the Bill in which this six-month period is stated?  I have not seen it but perhaps, as I get older, I am missing things.  I acknowledge this is an objective of the Minister of State, who is a good and efficient Minister.  I am aware he hopes it will be a period of six months, as do all Members, but can I point out that the direct provision arrangements were introduced 15 or 20 years ago and were meant to be for a limited period?  Initially, they were meant to be for approximately six months but here they are, 20 years later, still in place.  Consequently, six months can become 20 months or 20 years quite easily.  Again, can the Minister of State inform me as to why the Government considers it necessary to oppose something that is happening on the ground anyway to the apparent satisfaction and appreciation of the Government?  Can the Minister of State point me to somewhere in the Bill where it is made explicit that the situation will be resolved within six months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#ZZ00800","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>It is not specified in the Bill that applications will be processed within six months.

I totally accept the Senator's point that direct provision, for example, was supposed to be a six-month holding situation but has turned into a long-term solution, if one likes.  It is just like how, when rent allowance initially was brought in, it was meant to be an emergency payment for people at risk of homelessness but has turned into a 12-year or 15-year social housing provision.  The intent is that a new application will be processed in the first instance within six months and then processed to finality within 12 months.  As that is the intent, we no longer will have these six, seven, eight, nine or ten-year scenarios.  The entire purpose of the Bill is to ensure the provision of a much faster and more transparent process.<\/p> <p>People have suggested unfairly that the Government's intention is it will be quicker to deport somebody.  As for asylum applications, asylum is a sacred status that is afforded to an individual when given by any country.  If a person is awarded asylum status in Ireland or any other country, it is an internationally-recognised sacred status.  Consequently, it is not something that is given out lightly.  However, in any application process, some people succeed and others do not.  That is the system as it will be anywhere in the world and it will be the same system here in Ireland.  Some people will be successful and others will not.  However, the intention of the Bill is that an application will be processed in the first instance within six months and to finality within 12 months in order that people will not be languishing in a centre or within the system for a prolonged time.  I also remind Members that while approximately half of those who seek asylum in Ireland are in direct provision centres, approximately half are not.  While Members keep returning again and again to the issue of direct provision, and I understand the issues are linked, it is not central to the Bill, which is dealing with a new application process.  Approximately 4,000 of those people are outside the direct provision system in Ireland and, therefore, one must be aware this legislation is for every applicant who comes into Ireland and it will be a much more speedy process, which is what the single procedure is all about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#ZZ01100","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>What the Minister of State is intimating certainly would be welcome.  Again, if one goes through the report of the working group on the protection process in respect of the issues regarding those who already are in the system, paragraph 3.128 is a recommendation for persons awaiting decisions at the protection process and leave to remain stages for five years or more.  It states: \"All persons awaiting decisions at the protection process and leave to remain stages who have been in the system for five years or more from the date of initial application should be granted leave to remain or protection status as soon as possible and within a maximum of six months from the implementation start date subject to the three conditions set out below\".  It then goes on to discuss the issue of persons with a deportation order and the recommendation outlined in paragraph 3.166 pertains to what Members are discussing at present, namely, the new single procedure to be implemented.  It states: \"Once the single procedure has been enacted, to avoid a repeat of the circumstances which gave rise to the establishment of the Working Group, that the same principle and mechanisms aimed at addressing the situation of persons currently in the system for five years or more should apply for persons who have cooperated with the process in line with statutory obligations.\"  I take it this is the six months the Minister of State is discussing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If the working group included it in its recommendations, both Ministers signed off on those recommendations and the Department that was party to the debate agree with the six-month figure, why will the Minister of State not put it in the legislation?

Being an applicant for international protection is not a reason for arresting somebody.  This is getting very close to harassment and to racism.

There are other amendments involved.  Amendment No. 44 relates to altered and-or substituted identity documents.  This aims to prevent attaching a penalty to a means by which many asylum seekers and refugees access protection in accordance with article 31 of the 1951 Refugee Convention.  The insertion of \"altered or substituted identity document\" expands the categories of documentation grounds for detaining a person.  This is wider than that contained in the Refugee Act 1996, which only contains reference to forged documents under section 9(7)(f) of that Act.  The IRC receives reports that agents and smugglers who facilitate the transfer of asylum seekers to the State force them to hand over their own original identity documents in return for substituted identity documents, as defined by section 20(18) of the Bill.  The subsection, as drafted, would give immigration officers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power to arrest persons in such circumstances and detain them.  This is contrary to the State's obligations under article 31 of the Refugee Convention.  If the amendment was inserted in the Bill, the definition of \"substituted identity document\" under section 20(18) would also be deleted.  Smugglers and traffickers often force people with protection needs to exchange their original documents for substitute documents as defined under section 20(18).  Making it an offence to possess, or to have possessed, such documents would unreasonably penalise persons who have no choice but to rely on such smugglers and-or traffickers to escape persecution and-or to reach a place of safety in their country of origin.<\/p> <p>The purpose of the amendment No. 47 is to reinstate the District Court's power to detain under Refugee Act 1996, as amended.  A total of 21 days is more than double the time the District Court was empowered to detain an applicant under section 9(10) of the Act.  The State's power to interfere and-or restrict an individual's right to liberty must be proportionate and reasonable.  An individual's right to liberty is protected by article 40.4 of the Constitution, article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Restricting or otherwise interfering with that right is a matter of the utmost seriousness.  Section 20(3)(a) would almost certainly result in persons with protection needs being detained for periods of up to three weeks renewable pending the determination of their application for protection.  This is a disproportionate and unreasonable interference with the individual's right to liberty and, moreover, with his or her to access protection.  The IRC is concerned that such periods of detention would hamper and-or otherwise impact on his or her application for protection and that it would aggravate post-traumatic stress disorder and related symptoms of trauma.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 50 relates to arrest without warrant for failure to comply with conditions.  This reinstates the power to detain given to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, while limiting unnecessary expansion of its power to arrest without warrant.  As I recommended on the previous amendments, the power to arrest without a warrant is an extraordinary measure.  Section 29 seeks to expand the categories of persons An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may arrest without warrant from section 21, which is contrary to the right of liberty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#EEE00900","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>With regard to amendment No. 42, I cannot agree to the deletion of the reference to &ldquo;arrest without warrant&rdquo; at the start of section 20.

It is also incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which presupposes that those who are affected by a law should be able to ascertain its meaning and effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#FFF00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"vote","time":1449493200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 7; N\u00edl, 18.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators David Norris and Trevor \u00d3 Clochartaigh; N\u00edl, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#FFF00300","aye":["1157","1196","1136","1122","1115","1142","1164"],"nay":["1148","1138","1150","1208","1165","1151","1158","1130","1166","1172","1152","1135","1132","1134","1118","1153","1163","1171"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>SECTION 20<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 42:<\/p><blockquote>In page 22, lines 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;arrest without warrant an applicant and&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#GGG00100","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 43:<\/p><blockquote>In page 22, line 16, to delete &ldquo;him or her&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an applicant&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#GGG00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 44:<\/p><blockquote>In page 22, line 26, to delete &ldquo;, altered or substituted&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#GGG00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 47:<\/p><blockquote>In page 22, line 35, to delete &ldquo;21 days&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;10 days&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#GGG00800","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 48:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449493200,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 49 in the name of Senator van Turnhout is being withdrawn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120700002#GGG01200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1449493200,"counter":344,"content":"<p>No explanation has been given as to why it is being withdrawn.
