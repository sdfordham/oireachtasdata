The courthouse is an iconic and a beautiful building on Abbey Street in Roscommon town.  It has housed both the Courts Service and Roscommon County Council for over 100 years, having been built in the 19th century.  The local authority received approval to build new civic offices in Roscommon town.  My former colleague and former Minister of State Michael Finneran and I as a Senator and a Deputy have been working with council members for years to obtain new facilities for Roscommon County Council by way of the location of a one-stop shop in the area.  That is now well under way and near completion.  Staff will vacate the courthouse later this year and there will be an opportunity for the Courts Service to look at the building and the provision of services in a modern justice system.<\/p> <p>The courtrooms are very attractive and beautifully laid out, but there are no facilities for a children's court or to deal with other issues that arise today and which were not considered when the building was erected.  It is a great opportunity for the Courts Service to review and refurbish the building, provide wheelchair access and lifts to the first floor and to create a centre for all the activities of the justice system in the area.  The court clerks are located at least one mile from the building, which is not a good approach to adopt.  Therefore, we need to look at this issue.  I am sure the Minister, the Department and the Courts Service will give it top priority.  There is a question of negotiations with Roscommon County Council, but I presume they will be completed speedily.<\/p> <p>The building invokes many memories for many.  During the years it served many purposes.  The council chamber, in which I served for over 20 years, would be ideal for a children's court.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Terry Leyden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->All of the rooms will be occupied by barristers and solicitors.

The Minister regrets she is unable to be present for this discussion.<\/p> <p>As the Senator may be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service.  Furthermore, section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in its functions, including in regard to the provision, maintenance and management of court buildings.  The Minister has had inquiries made and has been informed by the Courts Service that it is aware of the current shortcomings of the court facilities in Roscommon courthouse.  The Courts Service has confirmed that the capacity of the courtrooms is limited and the facilities for court users are not satisfactory.  The Minister was also informed that due to the unsatisfactory office accommodation in the building, the Courts Service office in Roscommon has been moved to another building in the town.  However, the Courts Service has assured the Minister that it is committed to providing improved court facilities in Roscommon town, which is one of a small number of county towns where a new or refurbished courthouse remains to be provided.<\/p> <p>The Minister has been informed that, with the departure of Roscommon County Council from the building, the Courts Service has considered the potential for the development of the courthouse. It is understood that the initial assessment is that the courthouse could be suitably redeveloped within the historic structure if the Courts Service had all of that building available to it, along with some additional space adjoining it.  As the Senator will appreciate, the cost of acquiring the additional space would be a major factor in deciding whether to redevelop the historic courthouse or to provide a new building on a new site.<\/p> <p>The Courts Service has stated that the acquisition of additional space in the courthouse for its redevelopment has been the subject of discussions between the service and Roscommon County Council over a number of years.  Offers have been made by the Courts Service to the county council in the past to acquire additional space, but no agreement was reached.  The Minister has been informed that the new county council offices, which are adjacent to the courthouse, have been designed in a way to allow for the necessary space for the future development of the historic courthouse.  While the Courts Service currently does not have funding to undertake work in Roscommon, it has assured the Minister that the development of courthouse facilities in Roscommon town is part of its plans for the future.  The Courts Service will keep the issue of Roscommon courthouse under review.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will appreciate, since the establishment of the Courts Service a substantial programme of investment in court facilities, amounting to &euro;250 million, was undertaken with over 50 venues being newly built or refurbished.  Many others were substantially upgraded.  This level of investment has enabled the service to greatly improve the standard of accommodation, including facilities for people with disabilities, jury facilities, custody cells, consultation rooms etc..  There was also an ongoing programme of investment in technology at court venues.  Work carried out includes the development of the Criminal Courts of Justice, completed as a PPP project, the construction of 13 new courthouses, refurbishment of 41 court venues and upgrade of many smaller venues.<\/p> <p>In July 2012, the Government announced an investment package, which includes seven courthouse projects, with new courthouse buildings being developed in Drogheda, Letterkenny, Limerick and Waterford and substantial refurbishment and extension works to existing courthouses to be carried out in Cork, Mullingar and Waterford.  The Courts Service is working with the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office of Public works and the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, to progress these projects.  Substantial preparatory work has already been carried out.  It is expected that contracts will be signed in October this year, with delivery expected in 18 to 24 months, depending on the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#B00200","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>As I stated, my wish is that the courthouse be refurbished rather than moved to a new site.

This issue follows on from an issue I raised four weeks about a family in the Cork city council area whose child has a physical and intellectual disability.  While that family were advised in July 2008 by a city council official of work to be carried out to their home to accommodate their daughter this work has yet commenced.<\/p> <p>The issue I am raising today is the need for appointment of a disability officer.  The aforementioned case is not the only case with which I am dealing.  In fact, there are 57 families in Cork awaiting work to their homes to accommodate people with disabilities.  In my dealings with Cork city council I have had interactions with officials from the housing department, finance department, architects department and so on.  No one person appears to be in charge of a file.  As I speak, the child, whose family have been waiting seven years for work to be done to their home, is in intensive care in a hospital in Cork.  This family have provided the highest standard of care for their child over many years.  She has to be lifted out of bed every morning, washed and tube fed.  It is wrong that this family is providing this level support and we are not giving them the additional support they need.  Like me, when they contact Cork City Council they can find no one person to respond to their needs.  <\/p> <p>While there is a disability officer in place to deal with local authority staff who have a disability there is no disability officer to interact with local authority tenants who have disabilities.

This function is to provide or arrange for and co-ordinate the provision of assistance and guidance to people with disabilities in accessing services in local authority areas irrespective of where they live.<\/p><p>In addition to the statutory access officers, many local authorities also have a combination of equality officers, liaison officers, partnership co-ordinators, equality action teams and social inclusion units.  In order to support local authorities, the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, provides a range of advice and guidance on the delivery of services for people with disabilities, fosters best practice in that regard and operates the access officer network.<\/p><p>The Government's national housing strategy for people with a disabilities, which was published in 2011, sets out a broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities through mainstream housing policy.  The vision of the strategy is to facilitate access for people with disabilities to the appropriate range of housing and related support services, delivered in an integrated and sustainable manner that promotes equality of opportunity, individual choice and independent living.  As part of the implementation of the strategy, dedicated local housing advice centres are being developed at local authority level that will provide integrated and accessible advice and information to support all people with their housing and related support needs.  These centres will complement the various other information and support services that are available to people with a disability at a local authority level who may wish to discuss their housing circumstances, be they local authority tenants or those living in another setting.<\/p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government provides funding to local authorities for various social housing supports, including adaptations and extensions to the social housing stock to meet the needs of local authority tenants with disabilities or to address serious overcrowding.  Funding provided by the Department meets 90% of the cost of such works, with each local authority providing the remaining 10%.  The Department is liaising with all local authorities in respect of requirements for 2015 in this regard.  The administration of the funding locally is a matter for each local authority, including decisions on the projects to be implemented.<\/p><p>I assure Senator Burke I will ensure that this information finds its way to the Minister.  The circumstances outlined by the Senator are difficult.  It is unconscionable that a young woman in such circumstances would wait so many years, given the fact that it appears that grant approval has been given to the family.

It was by pure accident that I came across the issue.  I have been dealing with it for the past nine months.  I have helped the family to file a complaint with the Ombudsman for Children, which is the only route available to it.<\/p><p>I spoke with COPE, which provides support services for people with disabilities.  It looks after more than 1,200 people in its facilities in Cork and supports the family in question.  COPE told me that, when it dealt with Cork City Council, as far as the council was concerned this was just a case of a family with a number and, while the council accepted that works needed to be done, it did not have the necessary funding.  I understand that the council was allocated &euro;361,000 last year for this type of work, but I cannot get information on what happened to that funding.  Some of it may have been returned to the Department.<\/p><p>There is a lack of accountability.  The family has been left to look after the child.

They asked me to raise this issue with the Minister.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware, major development is planned for the docklands under the docklands strategic development zone, SDZ, from the convention centre and the IFSC to the 3Arena and the new Central Bank building.  It is important that this development not only be done in a way that is sensitive to the needs of residents who will see considerable change in their area, but also brings a community benefit.  One of the best ways of doing so is by securing employment for locals during the construction phase and when the new businesses open.  This is particularly important, given that it is an area of high unemployment.  There are many construction workers in the area and others are training in various aspects of construction.<\/p> <p>This initiative would also be in the interests of local businesses if they are to integrate properly in their communities and be accepted by same.  Not only should people be given construction jobs during development, but companies should be encouraged to employ people locally and run trainee internships for local students so that they might get business experience.  There is an opportunity to link the development with the National College of Ireland, NCI, which is based in the IFSC.  Companies' skills needs could be identified for the NCI, which could then ensure that local people acquired those skills.

As a result of the economic downturn and, in particular, the distressed state of the property market, the DDDA's financial position has been under significant strain in recent years.  On 29 May 2012, the Government decided that the authority would be wound up.  Since this decision, the DDDA has been proceeding with an orderly wind-up process.<\/p> <p>One of the Minister's key legislative priorities this year is the publication of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (dissolution) Bill.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Gerald Nash:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2281\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This Bill will ensure that all of the issues pertaining to the dissolution and wind up of the DDDA, particularly in respect of certain complex planning matters, are fully dealt with.  The Bill will reaffirm the Government's commitment to the key objectives in relation to the docklands area.  In particular, the Government is committed to: maintaining and enhancing the docklands' brand and international marketability as an attractive and prime location for investment and high value development; providing for an appropriate set of fast-track planning procedures; continuing to involve the local community and business sector in the regeneration project; and facilitating job creation.<\/p><p>While section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides that a planning application may be granted subject to a condition relating to the allocation of jobs locally, such conditions would not be considered appropriate in this context.  However, other actions are under way in the Docklands to underpin the Government's commitment to the development of a local employment and enterprise strategy.  Specific objectives are included in the planning scheme for the North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock strategic development zone to underpin liaison with agencies and organisations working in the docklands to maximise educational opportunities, support employment for local residents and co\u00adordinate activities to maximise employment, volunteer and training opportunities for residents of all ages in the area.  A dedicated docklands office within Dublin City Council will be adequately resourced to lead the regeneration of the area into the future.  This office has initiated contact with local employment services, community training workshops, resource centres and other relevant stakeholders to commence discussions on how best to develop a strategy to maximise the opportunities of local employment.  Docklands residential and business communities have been centrally involved in the regeneration programme, particularly through their membership of the docklands council, which was set up under the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997.  This council will be replaced by a new docklands consultative forum through which the voices of the docklands communities will continue to be represented in future development of the area.  It is envisaged that employment and enterprise will be the focus of one of the sub-committees of the docklands consultative forum.  The residential community of the docklands area is central to its continuing development and it is projected that the population of the area will grow by almost 6,000 in the coming years.  The interests of the residents are central to the integrated and sustainable growth of that community.  Through the involvement of representatives on the docklands consultative forum, as well as the important role of local public representatives on Dublin City Council, those interests will be recognised and nurtured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#C01000","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I welcome that work is under way to develop a strategy and a consultative forum for residents but the engagement needs to go beyond consultation to real involvement.

That is one way of creating a sense of local ownership of a significant public and social infrastructure project.  I support the spirit of what the Senator is trying to achieve.  It is important to ensure the existing community in the Docklands has ownership in what may be significant future investment in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#D00300","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1426069800,"counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#E00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion regarding arrangements for the sitting of the House on Tuesday, 24 March, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, report of Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the adoption of new Standing Order 103O, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 1; No. 2<i>a<\/i>, Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2015, all Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2, with the contributions of group spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed six minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed four minutes, and Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken immediately thereafter; No. 2<i>b<\/i>, motion for earlier signature of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2015, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 2<i>a<\/i>; No. 3, R&aacute;itis maidir le Seachtain na Gaeilge, to be taken at 1.30 p.m. and conclude not later 2.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 2.40 p.m.; No. 4, Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Bill 2014 - Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 2.45 p.m. and adjourned not later than 4 p.m., if not previously concluded; and No. 5, Private Members' business, Succession (Amendment) Bill 2015 - Second Stage, to be taken at 4 p.m., with the time allocated for this debate not to exceed two hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#E00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I draw attention to a comment made last week by the esteemed leader of the country who expressed sadness about the impact emigration had had on people's lives.  He said: <blockquote><br \/><br \/>We also want people to be able to come home.  Emigration has a devastating impact on our economy as we lose the input of people of talent and energy.  We need these people at home and we will welcome them.  I want to see them playing their part in the rebuilding of our economy, bringing home their experience to take up some of the jobs that are now being created.  <\/blockquote>That was the Taoiseach spelling out the devastating effects of emigration.  The most up-to-date scientific figures published by the CSO indicate that last year 1,600 people were emigrating every week - 800 young Irish people and 800 non-Irish people.  The sad fact is that very few of them are coming back.  The Taoiseach is saying we will welcome them back to fill the jobs being created, but we have to ask the question: why do they not want to come back to Ireland?  This question has to be addressed by each and every person in this Chamber.  What is wrong that the young people to whom I refer do not want to come back?<\/p><p>I draw attention to the most recent ESRI research bulletin entitled, Impact of the Great Recession on Unemployed Youth and NEET Individuals.  NEET stands for not in education, employment or training.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary M.

Before the downturn, young females were more likely to be unemployed; however, post recession the risk was higher for young males.  Non-Irish national youths have a higher likelihood of becoming unemployed since the economic downturn as well.  The importance of having a Leaving Certificate or higher level of education in reducing the risk of a young person becoming either unemployed or NEET has become stronger since the economic crisis.  Apart from their age profile, the characteristics associated with being a NEET youth ..... individuals were more likely to be aged 20-24, whereas unemployed youths were aged 15-19.<\/blockquote>As I have said before, we are inundated with public relation statements by this Government on a daily basis which camouflage and massage the figures.  I accept that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is doing his best to reduce unemployment but 22% of young people are still unemployed.  As far as I am concerned, having 22% youth unemployment is a crisis.  I ask the Leader to arrange an urgent debate on the ESRI's latest study on the impact of the great recession on the unemployed.  I also call for a discussion on what we can do to alleviate the 22% youth unemployment figure.  People say it is great that the unemployment figure has been reduced by 10.6% but there has not been a word about 22% youth unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#E00300","speaker":"1156","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>The Senator has made her point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#F00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>As usual, the details are in the statistics and not just in public relation statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#F00300","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Recent developments regarding the welfare Bill in Northern Ireland are deeply disappointing.

The documentary made for harrowing viewing but shone a spotlight on the treatment of women in Indian society.  One of the defence attorneys who represents the rapists  has said that if his own daughter had relations outside of marriage he would have no trouble in bringing her to his village and, in front of his family, he would douse her in petrol and set her on fire.<\/p> <p>Ms Singh's rape and killing was an appalling crime which shook India.  I am sure everyone is well aware that the documentary has since been banned.  A Member of the other House, from my constituency, has commented that Irish Aid should be cut to developing countries.  Last year I took a personal trip to India to see for myself where Irish Aid money goes.  I was assisted by the diplomatic corps in the Irish Embassy in Delhi who kindly brought me to a programme taking place in one of the slums of Delhi.  What I saw there would support even more money being spent on Irish Aid programmes.  I say that because I saw how Irish money is spent in the slums of Delhi.  It was spent on programmes to empower women, to help them become leaders in their communities and to teach them to be first responders for any medical emergencies.  Young women were also educated up as far as a third level qualification in order for them to come back and educate other young women in their communities.  The programmes provided a good positive cycle of improvements.  Also, TB has been eradicated and there has not been a cholera outbreak there in decades.  A proper sewerage system has also been installed in these slums but they remain terrible places to live.  <\/p> <p>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is scheduled to visit Delhi as part of the St. Patrick Day's celebrations.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister to visit the areas in Delhi where Irish Aid money is spent in order to see the work that is done there.  If the Minister does so then he will return here with the message that the money has not been wasted but has been spent on excellent and well managed programmes.  <\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to request the Indian Government to end its censorship of the documentary entitled \"India's Daughter\" and to broadcast the programme to the Indian public.

Unfortunately it is not a new phenomenon for us and it has had a devastating impact on Irish society not to mention the economy over many decades.  I think everyone would agree on that.  It is obviously a priority for the Government to tackle it.  The Senator should look at the annual report on the programme for Government for 2015 which was published yesterday.  It lists and documents fairly enough the measures that are being put in place to tackle, in particular the issue of youth unemployment, which the Senator rightly linked with emigration, in order to ensure that more young people can come home.  The two issues are closely linked and I know the Senator has done considerable work on them.  The issue of education and training for young people is also inextricably linked because of course that significantly enhances people's job prospects.<\/p> <p>As I think the Senator acknowledged, the Government's record on job creation is really strong.  As yesterday's report sets out, 90,000 new jobs have been created since 2012.  Unemployment is now down to 10.1% from a crisis peak of over 15%.  We are all aware of those figures, but behind them are human stories of people who are now in jobs and were not two or three years ago.  That is highly significant.  Youth unemployment is still too high, but it has been reduced by 30% in the four years of the Government.  In this coming academic year 23,000 jobseekers will be supported on back-to-education programmes and 28,000 places will be provided under the new Youth Guarantee scheme.  I was a huge advocate, as the Senator was, of the European Youth Guarantee project, which was a big highlight of the European Parliament elections last year.  I think we will see the benefit of that in terms of young people.<\/p> <p>In addition we have, of course, significant funding for the regional action plan to bring jobs recovery to every region to ensure it is not just confined to urban areas.  A great deal of work is being done on the specific issues the Senator raised.  Undoubtedly we should have a debate on the issue and I am very happy to seek that debate as she has requested.<\/p> <p>Senator Paul Coghlan raised concerns about what is going on with the welfare Bill in Northern Ireland and with welfare reform.  He expressed concern, which we all share, that a compromising of the Stormont House Agreement may result.  Of course, none of us wants any going back to the days before the peace process.  We all join the Senator in wishing the parties involved in the negotiations well in ensuring there is a resolution of the issues and that the Stormont House Agreement is not compromised.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>Senator Heffernan raised a very important issue that is close to my heart about the documentary programme \"India's Daughter\" which deals with the notorious and barbaric incident where a medical student was gang-raped and died as a result in 2012.  It was an appalling incident.  I absolutely agree with the Senator that in India that case in particular has highlighted the really appalling levels of sex crime against women and a patriarchal culture that appears to facilitate or enable and certainly does not do anything to bring perpetrators to justice.  That is a real concern, obviously for Indian society, but also for us.<\/p> <p>The Senator also mentioned Irish Aid programmes in India and commented on how excellent and well managed they are, which is good to hear.  I am happy to request that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, on his visit to India next week in addition to witnessing the Irish Aid projects - I am sure he will be doing that as part of his visit - would also request the Indian Government to ensure the documentary is not censored in India.  I absolute agree with the Senator that is a very important request we can make.  It is important for Ireland and other countries to put pressure on the Indian Government to ensure that documentary is not censored.<\/p> <p>Senator Colm Burke raised the economy and the achievements of Government in tackling unemployment.  I think I have dealt with that.  He also dealt with the very specific issue of delays in professional registration for emigrants returning from abroad.  The Senator is right; this is a very serious issue.  We need to fast-track professional registration to facilitate people returning.  I have certainly heard of delays in professional registration for individuals who are not necessarily Irish and were qualified abroad, and are coming to take up work here to provide much-needed skills and expertise to our society.  This is a big issue and the Senator is right to raise it.  We might consider having a debate in the House on the issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Leyden raised the issue of the drugs Bill that we will be debating after the Order of Business.  He rightly pointed out that there might be a need for the Attorney General to review the impact of this week's judgment by Mr. Justice Hogan in other areas.  I am sure that is already being done.

I suggest that he raise this as a Commencement matter and invite the Minister of State to address it very specifically. <\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke as Gaeilge so I hope I respond accurately.  He offered his condolences on the very sad death of Paul Drury.  We all join him in that regard.  Mr. Drury was a very fine journalist.  The Senator also spoke about his briefing in the AV room with the Free Legal Advice Centres on the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights.  It is a very important issue, which, as the Senator knows, was considered by the Constitutional Convention.  A recommendation was made for the inclusion of recognition of economic, social and cultural rights in the Constitution.  However, the report of the convention recommended that some more work be done on determining the best way to ensure constitutional recognition.  The Labour Party and I support the recognition of the rights in the Constitution, but determining how best that can be done without undermining unduly the doctrine of the separation of powers is legally complex.  We teased this out at length at the Constitutional Convention and it was of great interest.  It is a matter on which we can continue to work.  We might have a debate in this House on the convention's report.  Perhaps that would be the best way to address the matter.<\/p><p>I am sure the Senator will be raising the Irish language in the debate on Seachtain na Gaeilge, which will be taking place at 1.30 p.m. today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#G00600","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad: Motion","time":1426069800,"counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#H00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>That, notwithstanding anything in the Standing Orders relative to Public Business, the Seanad shall meet at 12 noon on Tuesday, 24<sup>th<\/sup>of March, 2015 and the Order of Business should be proposed at 1 p.m.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#H00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Standing Orders: Motion","time":1426069800,"counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#H00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>That the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the adoption of new Standing Order 103O be adopted, laid before the House and printed.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#H00700","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1426069800,"counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#H00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>We shall proceed to the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2015, all Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#H01000","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I propose that the House suspend until 12.15 p.m. because the Minister for Health is not available until then.

I am grateful for the support received from my colleagues in the D&aacute;il yesterday in bringing the legislation to this stage.  I also express my appreciation to this House for agreeing to deal with the Bill at such short notice.<\/p><p>The ruling by the Court of Appeal yesterday means the numerous substances which have been controlled by Government order in the years since the Act came into force cease to be controlled under the Act.  The court ruled on an appeal against a High Court judgment of May last year.  The High Court had upheld the constitutionality of section 2(2), the provision in the Act empowering the Government to declare substances to be controlled under the Act.  The Court of Appeal concluded that this provision was deficient in principles and policies and, accordingly, was repugnant to Article 15.2.1&deg; of the Constitution which vested the sole and exclusive power of making laws in the Oireachtas.  Accordingly, any order made under this power is invalid.<\/p><p>While the State had no way of knowing how the Court of Appeal would find, we planned for this possibility by preparing the Bill and ensuring it could be brought before the Houses without delay.  The Bill aims to deal with the fall-out of yesterday's judgment by reinstating the <i>status quo ante<\/i>to the substances controlled by Government order.  I hope it will meet with the swift approval of the Seanad today.  I intend to seek to have an earlier signature motion passed.<\/p><p>By way of explanation, the Misuse of Drugs Act has two primary purposes.  It establishes a system of control over certain drugs to protect the public from dangerous or potentially dangerous and harmful substances and facilitates the safe use of certain controlled drug substances which, although harmful if misused, have medical and therapeutic value.  Under the legislation, unless expressly allowed to do so, it is illegal to possess, supply, manufacture, import or export a controlled substance.<\/p><p>What is a controlled substance under the Act?  These are substances which are either known to be or have the potential to be dangerous or harmful to human health, including their liability for misuse or causing social harm.  In general, they are substances which affect the central nervous system, producing some mind-altering effect.  This may be stimulation, depression, hallucinations or another significant change.  Additionally, many of these drugs have the potential to cause addiction or dependence, whether physical or psychological.<\/p><p>A substance may be declared controlled under the Act in one of two ways.  The first is if it is listed in the original Schedule to the 1977 Act.  The second is if it has been declared controlled by the Government by means of an order made under section 2(2) of the Act.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Leo Varadkar:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2192\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Subsequent to a substance being declared controlled, the Minister for Health then makes regulations to place controls on the import, export, production, supply and possession appropriate to that substance.  The Schedule to the Act lists more than 100 substances which are controlled, including cocaine, heroin, cannabis, LSD, certain amphetamines and other well and less well known substances.  These are not affected by yesterday's judgment.  However, the legislators in 1977 recognised that it was important to future-proof the legislation by providing a mechanism by which additional substances could be declared controlled without undue delay.  This was far-seeing because as we all know numerous dangerous substances which might not have been known about, or might not have even existed, in 1977 have emerged on the drugs market in the intervening period.  Accordingly, the Act provided under section 2(2) that additional substances could be controlled by means of Government order.  Since 1977, this power has been used nine times by several Governments to control a wide range of dangerous substances, including ecstasy, and most recently head shop drugs.  Until yesterday, seven of those nine orders were in place.<\/p><p>Yesterday, section 2(2) under which Government orders are made was declared unconstitutional by the Court of Appeal.  This judgment will be carefully examined by my Department and the Attorney General with a view to considering its implications, what future amendments to the legislation may be required and whether an appeal to the Supreme Court is warranted.  What is clear is that, as a result of this judgment, all Government orders made under this Act ceased to be valid as of yesterday.  This means that all substances which had been declared controlled by Government order, many of which pose significant health risks for people who use them, are now no longer controlled.  Accordingly, the purpose of this short but important Bill is to resubmit these substances to control under the Act.  The Bill does so by inserting these substances by name into the Schedule to the Act.  In order to reaffirm the controls which apply to these substances, the Bill also confirms a number of ministerial orders and regulations made under the Act, thereby giving these instruments statutory effect as though they were an Act of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>Controlling substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act is an ongoing process which involves national and international co-operation and engagement.  The drugs phenomenon is an international issue that needs to be tackled in a co-ordinated way and addressed in a global context.  Two United Nations conventions provide the international legal framework for addressing the illicit drugs phenomenon.  The fundamental objective of the conventions is to protect the health of people from the inappropriate use of controlled drugs and to ensure that the use of controlled drugs is restricted to medical and scientific purposes.  Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland's obligations under these international conventions.  Of course, it is open to parties to the UN conventions to extend the scope of control to a wider range of substances, which Ireland has done.  Furthermore, substances are also scheduled under the Act in accordance with EU Council decisions or where there is evidence that substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.<\/p><p>The process by which substances are subjected to control by the Government under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 is highly technical and complex in order to ascertain whether the abuse potential is such as to warrant control.  This work includes monitoring of trends of drug abuse in the national and international drugs markets and the identification of substances and classes of substances that are being used in the drug culture.  It involves information exchange between Departments and State agencies regarding trends in usage, seizures and health effects.  The development of highly technical legislative provisions which precisely describe individual chemical substances or groups of substances is an important part of the work of accurately controlling substances.  Government orders have declared controlled a wide range of substances by means of generic definitions, thereby aiming to stay ahead of the clandestine laboratories which deliberately circumvent national controls.  Since 1977, nine Government orders have been made, of which seven continued in operation until today.  The most recent order was made in December 2014 when a number of substances were controlled arising from EU Council decisions.  Substances controlled by Government order range from substances which are useful medicines but which have abuse potential, such as benzodiazepines, to plants which have psychoactive properties such as magic mushrooms, to synthetic substances sold as \"bath salts\", \"incense\" or \"research chemicals\".  In fact magic mushrooms are a fungus not a plant as far as I know.<\/p><p>Members of the House will recall the head shop phenomenon of a few years ago.  Some people mistakenly believed that because products sold in these shops were \"legal\" that they were \"safe\".  Government orders in 2010 and 2011 controlled the substances then commonly being sold in head shops, including synthetic cannabinoids, BZP derivatives and mephedrone.  These controls, coupled with the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010, helped to address this problem.  Prior to the introduction of the 2010 Act there were more than 100 head shops operating in the State.  Since the introduction of the Act, the head shop trade in Ireland has almost disappeared.<\/p><p>The speed at which new psychoactive drugs emerge is evidenced by data from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction which received reports of 15 new psychoactive substances in 2005 and 73 in 2012.  The availability of detailed information regarding the chemistry of substances on the Internet, coupled with the availability of sophisticated technology and chemistry expertise, have contributed to the rapid evolution of the illicit drugs market, particularly in the last ten years.  It is important that we work together to counter the threat they pose to users, particularly young people.  A key part of that work is the control of substances under this Act.  The mechanism under which new substances can be controlled in the future will require consideration on foot of today's Court of Appeal decision.  This is not part of the proposed Bill as the matter will need to be considered further in light of the terms of the judgment.<\/p><p>I turn to an overview of the Bill.  The Bill provides that substances which were controlled before the court judgment by means of Government order may be added to the Schedule to the 1977 Act, thereby providing that they will once more be controlled.  Section 1 amends the Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  This provision inserts into the Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 the Schedule to this Bill.  These are the same substances previously controlled under Government orders made under section 2(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  The substances to be inserted into the Schedule are listed in paragraphs 1A and 1B to be able to specify which additional compounds, namely stereoisomers, esters and ethers, salts, products and preparations of substances are also controlled.  Section 2 confirms certain statutory instruments.  Certain ministerial orders and regulations made under the 1977 Act are confirmed as if they were an Act of the Oireachtas, thereby ensuring that they are not subject to challenge while the consequences of the Court of Appeal judgment are examined and addressed.  Section 3 is the Short Title, commencement and collective citation.  This is a standard citation provision.  It is intended the legislation will commence on the day after its passing; that is, the day after it is signed by the President.<\/p><p>In conclusion, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 provides for the control of dangerous substances and their regulation to ensure that they are only available for medicinal and other purposes in such a way as to prevent their misuse.  The Bill aims to protect the legal framework of this country in relation to controlled drugs by re-controlling substances which have been assessed as meriting such control.  The House will appreciate that this is a very important Bill which has public health and community safety at its heart.  I thank the House for its co-operation in allowing me to bring forward the Bill as a matter of urgency today and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members during the debate.  I hope the House will support the passage of the Bill without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#L00300","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to the House.

Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill which stems from a Court of Appeal judgment of 10 March 2015 that section 2(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, under which the Government was empowered to declare substances to be controlled for the purposes of the Act, was unconstitutional.  The purpose of the Bill is to add the substances previously controlled under Government order to the Schedule to the Act, thereby providing that they will once more be controlled.  As a result of the judgment, all substances controlled by means of Government orders under section 2(2) cease to be controlled with immediate effect and their possession ceased to be an offence.  These substances included ecstasy,  benzodiazepines, magic mushrooms and new psychoactive substances or so-called \"head shop drugs\".  The judgment has no implications for approximately 125 other substances including cannabis, heroin and cocaine, which is very welcome.  They are listed in the Schedule to the Act.<\/p> <p>We welcome very much this legislation.  I outlined on the Order of Business yesterday the fact that we welcomed the speed with which the Government has addressed this issue.  We support this legislation fully.

I welcomed the actions of the Government of the day, when the Ministers responsible, namely, Mary Harney and Dermot Ahern, added these substances to the list of those banned under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  As a result of the court decision yesterday, Members find themselves legislating to tighten or copperfasten that legislation.  I realise the difficulty the Minister faces in this regard.  As these are designer drugs, the manufacturers can tweak one component, thereby making it a different drug.  Consequently, it is extremely difficult to legislate for each one of these so-called designer drugs.  However, I welcome the initiative the Minister is taking today and hopefully it will copperfasten the illegality of these drugs.<\/p><p>Although today is not the day on which to have it, as Members seek to have this legislation passed through this House as quickly as possible, a major discussion on the entire issue of drugs is needed.  Discussion is needed on the national drugs strategy, on the supports available to those who find themselves addicted to drugs and on the resources being made available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to carry out detection and prosecution of people who are breaking the law.  I would like to have the primary focus of the latter on the Mr. Bigs, not the Mr. Smalls.  The regional drugs units have been disbanded in a number of areas, including my native county of Cavan and the neighbouring county of Monaghan.  In other counties, they have been depleted and amalgamated into the normal crime units and this is not acceptable.  This is a major crisis for the country and while I greatly welcome the initiatives of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, in respect of the tobacco industry and of the Minister himself regarding alcohol and its abuse, unfortunately this area has been ignored.  A focus must be put upon it and if this decision yesterday of the Court of Appeal does anything, hopefully it will reinvigorate Members' efforts to focus on the horrific consequences for those who unfortunately are addicted to drugs.  I wish to reiterate a point mentioned by my colleague, the Minister, or rather Deputy Kelleher.

I thank him, the departmental officials and all those involved in the background in the Office of the Attorney General for bringing forward this legislation so rapidly.  When this matter was brought before the High Court, it was argued that section 2(2) of the 1977 Act was unconstitutional.  The public perception at present is that the Government is solely in charge of legislation and the role of the Oireachtas is too often forgotten.  Interestingly, however, if one considers the judgments of both the High Court and the Supreme Court, the provision in the Constitution at Article 15.2 1&deg; sets out clearly that \"The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.\"  That was the argument used in the court in respect of the section of the 1977 Act and whether the regulation that subsequently came in was in breach of, or not in compliance with, the aforementioned article in the Constitution.  I welcome the decision of the Court of Appeal.  While I acknowledge the Minister may not like to hear me say that, it is important that the checks and balances are in place.  That is the purpose of the structure encompassing the Oireachtas, the Government and the courts and it is only right that Members stay within the Constitution when bringing forward legislation and regulation.  I have made this point previously but I recall being involved in 2004 in identifying where a regulation was brought forward in respect of nursing home charges only to find in that case that there was not even appropriate legislation to give power to the Minister to bring forward a regulation.  Consequently, for more than 20 years moneys were being deducted from people in nursing homes, which was completely illegal.  Therefore, it is important that the checks and balances are in place.<\/p> <p>In the case put forward by the State, although Mr. Justice Paul Gilligan held in favour of the State in the High Court, the Court of Appeal held otherwise.  Consequently, this legislation is now necessary and while I welcome the decision of the Court of Appeal, I do not welcome the fact that technically, these substances are back on the market legally today and no powers are available to deal with that.  Therefore, it is important to pass this legislation.<\/p> <p>Section 2 sets out clearly and puts into legislation all of the regulations as set out in Schedule 2.  This shows how the whole area has changed in recent years as there are approximately six different lots of regulations and exemption orders that have been brought in since 1977 to deal with this area of substances which are a danger to people.  It was only right that they were outlawed.  However, it is a question of making sure, when Members try to outlaw something, that they stay within the Constitution.  Therefore, this legislation now does this and the Bill deals with all the issues that previously were dealt with under regulation.  It now brings them forward in legislative form and therefore, it is important that Members pass the Bill and that it becomes law as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>The court decision also raises serious issues regarding other legislation in which regulation was brought in.  The question arises as to whether such regulation may not stand up were someone to decide to challenge it.  There is now an urgent need, particularly in respect of health and justice issues, for Members to examine these and ascertain whether it is necessary to introduce amending legislation in a number of other areas.  Members should not be obliged to wait for the courts to make the decisions in this regard.<\/p> <p>I refer to the issue of the court asking whether the secondary legislation in question goes further than simply giving effect to principles and policies that are set out in the primary legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to seek further clarification, and the Department should consider whether it should appeal the case to the Supreme Court so that there is a clear definition and interpretation of the words &quot;principles and policies&quot;.

I question whether we might leave loopholes in legislation when we move too quickly.

If we are going to tackle the drugs scene, we must take action.  I imagine this is the action the Minister will be expected to take and I am delighted he will be able to do it.

Let us have a wider debate on drug use to ensure we do not allow other doors to open in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#O00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Like other Senators, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I note the very speedy way it has been brought before us in light of yesterday's Court of Appeal judgment.  As the Minister said, the possibility of the outcome of the judgement had been anticipated and the Department had planned for in by preparing the Bill.  This is commendable and, as Senator Quinn said, is in contrast with earlier incidents.  Many of us will recall the scramble to legislate following the Supreme Court decision in the case of CC <i>v.<\/i>Ireland in 2006, when the offence of unlawful carnal knowledge of a minor was struck down.  The 2006 Act that was brought in had to be amended subsequently.  It is not a new phenomenon that a decision would strike down legislation as unconstitutional and have implications for criminal justice legislation.  I was involved in some of the cases around the Damache decision, which had a similar effect on aspects of search warrant procedure and the Offences Against the State Act and legislation was required to deal with it.<\/p><p>It is very good that the Bill had been prepared in anticipation of the judgment.  There will be no substantive change to the law &ndash; pardon the pun.  It restores the substances that were previously controlled under statutory instruments and restores the <i>status quo<\/i>.  The judgment of Mr. Justice Hogan in the Stanislav Bederev case in the Court of Appeal, which gave rise to the legislation, is robust and I read it with great interest.  As Senator Colm Burke said, it states very robustly the principles in the Cityview case in 1980 in which Chief Justice Tom O&rsquo;Higgins said it was not permissible to delegate legislative power where it was more than a mere giving effect to principles and policies contained in the primary statute.  Mr. Justice Hogan very logically teased out the application of this principle to the misuse of drugs provisions, particularly to the statutory instruments which had purported to list other species of controlled drugs.  While the Government is considering whether to take an appeal to the Supreme Court, his judgment points out that the primary Act, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, say a controlled drug is either one that is listed in the Schedule or declared by the Government.<\/p><p>It does not appear to limit the Government's power to classify drugs by reference to the categories of the drugs in the Schedule, which was one of the arguments the State put forward.  Nor does the Long Title of the Act give sufficient guidance or criteria to the Government to allow it to be argued successfully that a statutory instrument was merely giving effect to principles and policies.  As Mr. Justice Hogan said, the Long Title, &ldquo;An Act to prevent the misuse of certain dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs&rdquo; would, arguably, enable the Government to ban tobacco and alcohol as &quot;dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs&quot;.  It shows the wide scope of section 2(2) and the extent of policy choices that is left to the Government in passing statutory instruments.  This is a matter for further consideration as to whether the judgment will be appealed.<\/p><p>As the Minister said, the consequences the judgment will have for other areas of the law where delegated power is provided for in primary legislation is a matter for consideration.  There have been reports on the consequences of the judgment for pending prosecutions.  Colleagues will be aware that the consequences of the CC case were limited by the subsequent Supreme Court judgment in A <i>v.<\/i>The Governor of Arbour Hill Prison.  The fallout was limited in the sense that persons whose cases had been concluded were not regarded as capable of taking action on foot of the judgment, even if they had been convicted of the unlawful carnal knowledge offence.  One would anticipate similarly limited consequences here for prosecutions which have concluded or persons who have pleaded guilty or been convicted.  It has been reported that in the small number of cases pending which involve substances which were controlled under the statutory instruments there was anticipation of a potential outcome in the case and other charges have been brought.  As the Minister said, the judgment does not affect the best known and most significant categories of controlled drugs, which are already contained in the Schedule to the 1977 Act.  It applies only to the substances added through the statutory instruments such as the psychoactive or so-called head shop substances.<\/p><p>The purpose of the legislation is to restore the <i>status quo<\/i>and it will receive cross-party support.  I would like us, on another day, to review our drug policy.  I am no fan of the prohibitionist approach.  We need to examine, in a considered and careful fashion, other countries which have adopted different approaches to the regulation of what we call controlled drugs.  The justice committee has a particular interest in Portugal's model and models of strategic decriminalisation of certain substances.  It has not been a happy experience.<\/p><p>Senator Wilson referred to the head shops which led to the passage of the legislation in 2010 and 2011.  A considered review would be a useful exercise.  All of us would welcome the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#O00300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.

It is good to see the Oireachtas and the Department were ready for this issue and got there to shut the stable doors before the horse has entirely bolted.  I put it to the Minister, however, that the national drugs strategy is not working.  There is widespread availability of all the substances we are seeking to outlaw.  I am not from a great metropolis, but I have seen around my own area the availability of class A drugs in the form of MDMA, ecstasy, and cocaine - you name it - every other weekend.  It is widespread in every other town and village across the country.  It has got to a stage where lads are going out to take a line with friends in front of people.  It is almost becoming acceptable and as if they were going out to smoke a cigarette.  It is a massive problem and one with which we are failing to deal.  If one walks around Dublin any day of the week, one will be met with zombies coming against one who are under the influence of an opiate of some type.<\/p> <p>I do not know that a total outlawing of every substance like this works.  The issue has been investigated at the very highest levels.  Former Presidents of the USA and leaders of South American nations have all fed into the notion that the war on drugs is being lost and cannot be won.  What should we do in that case?  Going down the road of complete criminalisation of everything has only played into the hands of the major criminal organisations which operate in our cities and towns.  I know many young lads who are under a self-imposed exile in the Balearic Islands and England because of moneys owed to these criminal organisations.  We do not have the necessary Garda resources to tackle them.<\/p> <p>I may be seen as coming out of left field with this one, but it may be that a piloted programme in a small area where the Government has total responsibility for issuing substances in a responsible manner to certain people is a useful idea.  We all live in the real world.  People are going to use recreational drugs anyway.  The fact that they are illegal can make them more attractive.  If there is something they are not supposed to do, people may get the idea that there might be something in doing it.  The issue of limited and controlled legalisation according to a liberal interpretation has not been tried.  It is mooted in a lot of different areas, including in certain places in South America where it is at a very advanced stage.  While all these drugs remain illegal, the profits from their sale and supply go to criminal organisations and spawn every sort of social ill that one can imagine.  It may be time for democratically elected governments to get control of that.  I see how the issue of alcohol is dealt with in Nordic countries where the sale is conducted by state-owned off-licences, which system works very well.  Perhaps, it is an idea that can be trashed out here.<\/p> <p>It must come from the Department of Health if a dedicated ministerial officeholder with full responsibility for drugs is to be appointed to take soundings from everywhere, including health professionals, drug users, those on the front line of our policing service who try to combat this multimillion euro business, and families affected by the misuse of drugs.  Let us have that debate instead of sticking our heads in the sand and pretending drug misuse and the availability of illicit drugs is not an issue in our society.

I got into considerable trouble in the Chamber last week when I suggested during a debate that Members might confine themselves to dealing with the legislation that was actually in front of them rather than to go off on tangents to talk about things that might not have been immediately relevant.  As legislators, we are bound to do so.  Mr. Justice Hogan's ruling yesterday points to the importance of legislators confining themselves to what is actually before them for discussion and focusing entirely on the legislative proposals with which they are dealing.  It is also important to note that Mr. Justice Hogan points to the massive interconnectivity between different Acts, citing the 1939 Act, the case of the quaintly named Pigs Marketing Board and the application of the Cityview Press test to legislation.   Who would have thought when Deputy Joan Collins was taking her challenge to the Supreme Court over the Government's authority to recapitalise the banks that her case would be cited to undermine the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977?

I would very much welcome a comprehensive debate and discussion with the Minister in this House on how these issues can be tackled.  Senator Heffernan put forward some very interesting ideas today which I, however, probably would not support.  I am conscious of the devastation being wrought by drug abuse in small towns and villages the length and breadth of the country.  We must redouble our efforts to ensure garda&iacute; and customs staff are sufficiently resourced to put the people involved in the illicit drugs trade out of business.  It is a major challenge.  The Minister will be well aware of the number of hospital beds that are taken up and the proportion of accident and emergency unit time and resources given over to people presenting with drug overdoses or who have injured themselves as a result of the use of drugs, as well as those who have been injured by persons misusing drugs.  This represents a major cost to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>There has been some discussion as to whether there should be a dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for drugs.

On the broader issue of drugs policy, I would not like the impression to go out that this issue has in some way been deprioritised by the Government.  That certainly is not the case.  In 2015, for the first time in several years, there has been no further cut to the budgets of local drugs task forces and of the Oversight Forum on Drugs, OFD, which I chair.  Even though we have had only a very modest increase in the budget for the Health Service Executive for this year, &euro;2.1 million of that allocation is being given to increase spending on drug treatment and prevention.  This means more detox beds at Merchant's Quay and Coolmine in 2015, more needle exchanges across the country and more investment in mental health support staff, which is particularly important.  Also this year I will commence the naloxone demonstration project, making naloxone available to several hundred addicts, users, care workers, staff, family members and the Prison Service, if it agrees to be part of the project, to ensure overdoses can be treated quickly on the scene, which will result in a further reduction in drug-related deaths in 2015.  The existing drugs strategy is due to expire in 2016 and work on the development of a new strategy will begin soon.  While Garda operational issues are a matter for the Commissioner, I would welcome a broader debate in the Seanad which might encompass a review of the current strategy and a discussion on what should be included in the new one.<\/p> <p>Several Senators called for a shift to a health-focused and addiction-focused approach to drugs rather than concentrating primarily on the criminal justice and enforcement aspect.  My own instincts are in the same direction, but it requires careful consideration and public buy-in.<\/p> <p>On the suggestion that there be a dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for drugs, that is a matter for the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste.  I always welcome extra help and have learned to delegate much better in this job than I did in the past.  I certainly am not trying to hoard responsibilities, but I am currently able to manage the many responsibilities of the role with the assistance of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  We have had dedicated Ministers of State in the past but I am not sure it always works well.  By their very nature, Ministers of State do not have the type of clout senior Ministers do because they are not at the Cabinet table.  However, if that approach is taken, the new role should be created as a dedicated position rather than being added on to an existing Ministry of State, it should be cross-departmental, because drugs issues span the areas of health, justice, education and youth affairs, and it should have a designated budget.<\/p> <p>I would like to correct a reference I made earlier.  I can now confirm that magic mushrooms are not plants but fungi, and fungi are neither plants nor animals.  I apologise to the mushroom-growing community for any offence that might have been caused.<\/p> <p>Finally, I take this opportunity to record my thanks to the civil servants in my Department, particularly Eugene Lennon and Siobh&aacute;n Kennan, who did all the preparation for this emergency legislation.  I was just briefed as things proceeded; they ensured the legislation was ready to go right away as soon as I got the text at 11 a.m. yesterday to say we had lost the case.  I also pay tribute to the Attorney General's office and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for their assistance in recent weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#R00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#R00400","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#R00500","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2015: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1426069800,"counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#R00600"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Schedules 1 and 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2015: Motion for Earlier Signature","time":1426069800,"counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#R01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>That pursuant to subsection 2&deg; of section 2 of Article 25 of the Constitution, Seanad &Eacute;ireann concurs with the Government in a request to the President to sign the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2015 on a date which is earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to her.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#R01200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 1.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow here.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Succession (Amendment) Bill 2015: Second Stage","time":1426069800,"counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#JJ00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, to the House and call on Senator Feargal Quinn to speak.

I am delighted he is here.  The Succession (Amendment) Bill 2015 is very important and I hope we have a good discussion on it.  We now know from a decision of the High Court in 2011, which is just four years ago, that where one joint tenant kills another, the killer gets to keep his or her share in a jointly owned property.  This is deeply unjust.  In fact, I have some difficulty with the term \"joint tenants\" which usually refers to a husband and wife, although it does not have to be on that basis.<\/p> <p>At the heart of the Bill which we are now debating is the fundamental principle that a person should not be allowed to profit from his or her crime.  It is a straightforward Bill which will provide that where one joint tenant kills another, the offender will have no entitlement to the victim's share of the property.  The offender will not be entitled to avail of his or her own share in the property either.  To some, this may seem harsh or even unjust, but where is the justice and fairness where one joint tenant kills another and then profits from the sale of the property?  Where a person has had his or her life ended along with his or her property rights, are we to be deferential to the offender?  Is this the result the authors of our Constitution intended and is it something we as legislators should stand over?  A further example of the law favouring the offender is the fact that where one spouse kills another, the offender is free to claim the spouse's pension payment in the same way as if the spouse had died naturally.  It is a further anomaly in our law which must be addressed.  We must make a change.<\/p> <p>In too many areas, our legislation is tilted in favour of the offender and the Constitution is invariably held up as a shield to proposals which even hint at fairness for victims.  Imagine that we go out of our way to be fair to the perpetrator.  The Government's advisors will say that we must err on the side of caution.  While the Constitution provides a good level of protection for property rights, it is sometimes forgotten that these property rights are not absolute.  In fact, the Constitution makes it very clear that property rights may be diluted or modified provided such interference is, in the words of Article 43.2.2o, in the exigencies of the common good and proportionate to the objective to be achieved.  The authors of the Constitution never intended that a person could kill another person and then reap the financial rewards.  Other countries which provide constitutional protection for property rights have introduced laws which are similar to the one I propose in this Bill.  In the United States of America, for example, states such as Massachusetts, West Virginia and North Dakota have all introduced legislation which has the effect sought to be provided for in the Bill.  Those laws are deemed to be compatible with the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution which, like the Irish Constitution, protects property rights.<\/p> <p>The Bill has been drafted with the advice of a number of lawyers who are more than satisfied with its constitutionality.  Section 2 is the key section as it seeks to insert two new sections into the Succession Act 1965.  The proposed new section 120A of the 1965 Act would apply to joint tenancies where there is only one surviving co-owner and that surviving co-owner has been found guilty of the murder, attempted murder or manslaughter of the other co-owner.  In those circumstances, the Bill provides that the joint tenancy is terminated and the entire interest in the property is vested in the estate of the victim.  The proposed new section 120B would apply to a joint tenancy where there are two or more surviving co-owners and one of the surviving co-owners has been found guilty of the murder, attempted murder or manslaughter of another co-owner.  In this situation, the Bill provides that the joint tenancy is modified so that the victim's and the offender's interests in the property are automatically vested in the estate of the victim.<\/p> <p>The current law in this area was clarified somewhat in a decision of the High Court in 2011.  In that case, Ms Justice Laffoy shed light on the path towards a legislative solution.  She said, \"The issues raised in these proceedings demonstrate that, ideally, there should be legislation in place which prescribes the destination of co-owned property in the event of the unlawful killing of one of the co-owners by another co-owner\".  It should be pointed out that Ms Justice Laffoy also alluded to the absence of legislation which would have allowed the court to interfere with the offender's property rights.  She seemed to envisage a Bill similar to the one I propose and did not in any way suggest that such legislation might not be permissible.  I ask the Minister of State to note this point in particular.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge that the Law Reform Commission is examining this issue in conjunction with a range of related aspects and some not all that related.  My impression is that the conclusion of the commission's work is some way off, which concerns me.  The drafting and passage of any other legislation on this topic is likely to take a number of years.  The Bill could be passed with the support of the House and, in time, replaced once the Law Reform Commission completes its work.  I am very much of the view that there is a gap in our law in this area which we should not leave open any longer.  We should pass the Bill today and it should become law.  When the Law Reform Commission makes its report a further enactment may supersede this law.  Given that the commission may take some time to come to a decision, we would at least have better law in place in the meantime.<\/p> <p>The killing of a human being is the gravest crime in law.  It is only right that succession and property law should prevent an offender from reaping the fruits of a terrible crime and being unjustly enriched as a result.  I appeal to the Minister of State and his colleagues across the House to support the passage of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#JJ00400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.

His proposals always are rooted in the need to address people's experience of things that are happening and to seek to bring fairness in some way.  That is what the law should be about at all times; it should be relevant to the situations that arise in life and which affect people and when the law is not doing justice, it needs to be amended.  Senator Quinn is quite right to bring forward this amending legislation and it deserves immediate support.<br\/><br\/>The common law injunction preventing one from benefiting from one's own wrongdoing has a long and distinguished lineage.  Captured in the maxim, <i>ex turpi causa non oritur actio<\/i>, that is, from a dishonourable cause an action does not arise, this prohibition was cited by the renowned Lord Chief Justice, Lord Mansfield, in the 1775 case Holman <i>v.<\/i>Johnson, in which that jurist set the rationale for what is known as the &quot;illegality doctrine&quot;.  He stated:<blockquote>The objection [to permitting a wrongdoer to benefit from his wrongful actions] is founded in general principles of policy ... The principle of public policy is this; <i>ex dolo malo non oritur actio<\/i>.  No Court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act.  If, from the plaintiff's own standing or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise <i>ex turpi causa<\/i>, or the transgression of a positive law of this country, there the Court says he has no right to be assisted.  It is upon that ground the Court goes.<\/blockquote>The laws of contract and of equity always have upheld principles that seek not to assist those who, to use the words from the law of equity, do not approach the court with clean hands.<br\/><br\/>The statutory law in this jurisdiction relevant to the Bill is set out in section 120 of the Succession Act.  In particular, the conviction of a defendant for manslaughter has clear implications in respect of the distribution of the estate of the deceased by virtue of the application of section 120 which provides:<blockquote>A sane person who has been guilty of the murder, attempted murder or manslaughter of another shall be precluded from taking any share in the estate of that other, except a share arising under a will made after the act constituting the offence, and shall not be entitled to make an application under section 117.<\/blockquote>As Senator Quinn has stated, a more modern consideration of these concepts is to be found in the decision of the Irish High Court in Cawley <i>v.<\/i>Lillis of 2011.  This unfortunate case, as Members will recall, concerned the manslaughter of a wife by her husband at their house in north Country Dublin.  In the Cawley case, while Ms Justice Laffoy acknowledged the long-standing principle of the common law I mentioned earlier, she accepted that where assets were jointly owned: &quot;The resolution of those issues primarily turns on the application of established principles of law and equity in the area of real property law, which is highly technical, rather than the exercise of discretion by the Court.&quot;  Consequently, the law is not entirely clear where property is jointly owned.<br\/><br\/>In the United Kingdom, the position is more clearly set out by the operation of statute.  The courts in the United Kingdom have a statutory power, under the Forfeiture Act 1982, to order the forfeiture of joint interests in property in cases where a person has unlawfully killed another.  Megarry and Wade, in their leading work, <i>The Law of Real Property<\/i>, explained the impact of those provisions in the British law and I think it is useful for Members if I set out their summary as follows:<blockquote>One consequence of the rule that no one may benefit in law from his own crime, is that, in general, if one joint tenant criminally kills another, the killer cannot take any beneficial interest by survivorship.  This rule of public policy, commonly known as the &quot;forfeiture rule&quot;, applies to cases of deliberate and intentional homicide, [where] the killing is murder, manslaughter or aiding and abetting a suicide.  It has not been conclusively settled in England whether the application of the rule causes the automatic severance of the joint tenancy or whether a constructive trust is imposed to prevent the killer from obtaining any benefit from his crime.  Where there are just two joint tenants, the answer will be the same on either view.<\/blockquote>Without engaging in an analysis of the distinction between the application of a constructive trust or the severance of a tenancy, it is sufficient to note that Ms Justice Laffoy determined that joint tenancy accrued to the husband who was guilty of his wife's manslaughter but that half of the property was held in constructive trust for the wife's estate.  The judge opined in the court, in a comment that would be <i>obiter<\/i>rather than binding, that:  &quot;The issues raised in these proceedings demonstrate that, ideally, there should be legislation in place which prescribes the destination of co-owned property in the event of the unlawful killing of one of the co-owners by another co-owner.&quot;  It is in light of these dicta that I welcomed this legislation as both timely and necessary.<br\/><br\/>I commend Senator Quinn's careful drafting of the Bill.  It is my view that he has taken a balanced approach and has acknowledged the constitutional protection afforded to property rights that the public policy considerations demand.  The Bill correctly proceeds on the basis that the constitutional rights in Article 43.2.2&deg; are not absolute.  Indeed, this is addressed in other comments of Ms Justice Laffoy in the Cawley case.  Article 43.2.2&deg; limits individuals' property rights in the &quot;exigencies of the common good&quot;.  This is the case where compulsory purchase orders can be made over land, it should be <i>a fortiori <\/i>the case where a person seeks to make a material gain over the estate of a deceased, having brought about that person's death.  This Bill is measured, well founded in the long-standing precepts of the law and proportionate to the objective to be achieved.  It deserves the cross-party support of the House.  I note this is a matter that is under consideration by the Law Reform Commission.  Members of the Oireachtas, and Senator Quinn more than once, have found themselves in a position where they really have anticipated the work the Government ought to have done itself already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#JJ00500","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#KK00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>This is the case here.

Too often in these Houses, one hears excuses like a proposal having potential unintended consequences or of the existence of some legalities that must be considered further.

The Minister for Justice and Equality come into the House recently to respond to a Commencement matter I raised in respect of domestic violence legislation and this is the ultimate end of the domestic violence crime.  The Minister has given me a commitment that before the end of this year, she will bring forward comprehensive legislation to bring together eight Acts to compound the legislation in order that the crime of domestic violence will be a crime and that those who commit it will be punished properly.  On dealing with pieces of the legislation, I understand the sentiment and agree with it 100%, although the Attorney General has a different opinion as to whether it would hold up in court to constitutional challenge.  However, I believe firmly that the issue of domestic violence must be dealt with in its entirety this year and the Minister has committed to that.  It is not just one legislative item that must change, unfortunately, as a whole raft of legislation is involved.  The Minister will bring together eight Acts in this regard.<\/p> <p>Obviously, this is very difficult for the families involved and this undoubtedly affects real people.  Last week, I listened to a case in which a man was found guilty of manslaughter.  I will not name anybody but he invited his former wife up to the bedroom, telling her he was going to shoot himself, but he shot her with a sawn-off shotgun.  He was convicted, not of what was absolute cold-blooded murder but of manslaughter.  I am unsure of the difference between murder and manslaughter as to me, that is absolute murder.  Again, this is the ultimate horrible end to savage domestic violence, where someone actually is murdered.

However, I support the sentiment and the absolute view that no one should be rewarded for a horrible crime that has ravaged our country.  There is no specific legislation to deal with it.  I have put forward many proposals to the Minister and I hope that we will deal with the crime of domestic violence in 2015, with those who commit it punished properly.  The perpetrator is the very last person who should be rewarded in any way.  That is where we go wrong.

As Senator Mullen said, this is not a new proposition in law but a well-known issue.  There is a name for it and Members can look up what these laws are called in other jurisdictions.  They are common laws as this is not a unique situation.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen mentioned a Latin maxim and there is another, <i>nullus commodum capere potest de injuria sua propria<\/i>.  These are ancient principles and it is a common issue over thousands of years.  Whether in Roman, British and Irish law or American law, these issues have been dealt with and Senator Quinn is dealing with the specific issue, namely, the severance of a joint tenancy, following on from the mandate of a High Court judge.  The particular judge is a well-known expert on conveyancing and property law.  The Government does not control the Seanad and I believe we should pass the law, allow it to proceed to Committee Stage and do what Senator Quinn has done before to resolve an issue.<\/p><p>People will be at the wrong end of the situation in the future because this happened so often in the past and will happen again.  We cannot be involved in a dereliction of duty.  Senator Mulcahy speaks about the need to ensure domestic violence is a crime.  There was a crime committed and someone was convicted of a crime in this case.  That is not an issue at all.  Conveyancing and succession law was not in place to deal with the matter satisfactorily.  Senator Quinn has proposed legislation on this point, although I accept there may be other issues in regard to domestic violence.  It is important to remember such issues but we are here to discuss one issue.  This involves not allowing a person who has committed a wrong to benefit from the wrong.<\/p><p>My party will support the legislation as set out clearly by Senator Quinn.  It does not warrant a huge amount of explanation but it demands a response.  The High Court has asked us for that response because it cannot decide cases in its absence.  It is not good enough to postpone it.  Senator Mullen said the Government should have done this before now but Senator Quinn is doing what we, as Oireachtas Members, should be doing by filling the gaps in law.  We should be listening to what the courts say to us every day of the week.  Yesterday, a case took place relating to the misuse of drugs and was rectified.  It is a similar situation, where the law has been found to be defective, although there was no constitutional aspect to this case.<\/p><p>It was regrettable to hear Senator Mulcahy talk about unconstitutionality although I did not catch the exact context.  It is a phrase that should never be used because it has been abused so often in this House.  Constitutional or legal issues are raised with every item of legislation put forward by the Opposition.

The current legal scenario, as we have seen in numerous cases, has the potential to compound the difficulties of family members mired in already tragic situations.  That someone convicted of murder should possibly benefit from the joint tenancy shared with the person whose life was taken is terribly unjust.  This needs to be rectified with haste and I hope tonight's proceedings make a significant contribution in this regard.<\/p> <p>As noted, the stated aim of the Bill is to provide for assignment of property rights deriving from a joint tenancy in circumstances where one co-owner is killed by another co-owner.  I agree that the current law is inadequate in this regard.  However, I am also cognisant of the advice given by the Attorney General with regard to the Bill.  My concern is that, as the Attorney General advises, the Bill in its current format may be unconstitutional and that, if it goes forward, we could encounter difficulties down the road.  These difficulties could be avoided if the Bill were reformulated in line with the comments of the Attorney General.<\/p> <p>It is also important to note the work being conducted by the Law Reform Commission, which has set up a consultation process on section 120 of the Succession Act 1965.  The deadline for submissions was 26 January.  Under this process, the commission is examining the provisions of section 120 in depth and sought submissions on the section, including the reform of the section of the Succession Act as it applies to property held in a joint tenancy, which is the primary focus of Senator Quinn's Bill.  However, the report from the Law Reform Commission will not be available until later this year.  We should do every thing we can to expedite it because the findings of the report, along with Senator Quinn's proposition, will be a key element in deciding how best to address the amendments needed.  It is my contention that these must be considered before finalising legislation.  We must act in haste on this point.<\/p> <p>Like many Oireachtas Members, I acknowledge and admire the tremendous work of Senator Quinn on this and other Bills.  However, if the Bill was to proceed in its current format, it would run into difficulty.  People convicted of murder and manslaughter, who seek to benefit from legal estates, could prolong the difficulty and tragedy for families by challenging the legislation before the High Court or the Supreme Court.  That does no one any favours.  We do not want to enact legislation that may lead to further revision down the line.<\/p> <p>The Bill requires a swift response.  I expect the Law Reform Commission to deliver its report as promised.  I want to see it happen as quickly as possible.  The Minister for Justice and Equality should ensure the Government works quickly to implement any changes suggested.  I commend Senator Quinn for putting the issue on the legislative agenda and I am supportive of the essence of what he is trying to achieve.  Once the Law Reform Commission report is forthcoming and the Attorney General has had the opportunity to appraise the report and consider the principles and essence of this Bill, it will ensure a substantial change in the law and give families some degree of relief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#LL00500","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Words fail me.

This is a matter which concerns and troubles us all.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to address this egregious situation, as well as the concerns eloquently raised here this afternoon.  We are all human beings and it requires a human response.<\/p> <p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who unfortunately cannot be here today, I thank Senator Quinn for tabling his Private Members&rsquo; Bill and for providing us with an opportunity to discuss the important and sensitive issues which arise in the context of succession law where a spouse or child has been found guilty of the unlawful killing of the other spouse or a parent.  I also thank Senator Quinn for approaching the Government to discuss his Bill.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and I hope to have an agreed approach to the development of legislation in this area.<\/p> <p>These issues have, unfortunately, come to the fore in recent years in several high-profile cases which have come before the courts.  Today's debate is both topical and timely.  It is also difficult for families who have been affected by these issues.  I acknowledge and extend my sympathies to the relatives who have lost loved ones in such tragic circumstances, especially those who join us today in the Public Gallery.  The Government understands and appreciates Senator Quinn's reasons for bringing forward this Bill and is entirely sympathetic to the important public policy objectives underpinning it.  We are also sympathetic to the families who are sadly affected by this.<\/p> <p>However, the Attorney General, who is responsible for advising Government on the compatibility of proposed legislation with the Constitution, is not convinced the Bill, as formulated, would withstand constitutional challenge.  The Minister, therefore, could not support the Bill at this stage on the basis the broad scope of its provisions risks infringing constitutionally protected property rights.  The Government is, however, examining the issues raised by Senator Quinn's Bill and intends to bring forward proposals later this year to deal with this issue, along with several related succession law matters based on a Law Reform Commission project which is already well advanced.<\/p> <p>I assure all Members and the families in the Gallery who have lost loved ones that it is the Government's intention to bring forward legislation, based on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission later this year and proceed quickly with enactment of that legislation.  There will be no foot-dragging in this area.<\/p> <p>The Minister has spoken to Senator Quinn regarding his future involvement with the Law Reform Commission and the Government wants to see his proposals brought to the commission for consideration.  I hope there would be an agreed approach to the serious issues which Senator Quinn brought to the floor of the House today.  Before entering into any further detail, the Minister for Justice and Equality and I want again to underline our sympathy and support, and that of the Government, for the victims of these horrendous crimes.  The burden for the victims in these cases is, of course, all the greater because the perpetrators have been part of the victim's own intimate family circle.<\/p> <p>It is a well-established legal principle in both common law and statute law that no person should be permitted to benefit from his or her unlawful conduct.  In the area of succession law, this means a person who is guilty of the unlawful killing of another person is prevented by force of law from benefiting from his or her victim's estate.  In short, the perpetrator is not allowed to inherit what he or she would otherwise have received under the victim's will or on intestacy if the deceased had not made a will.  This long-standing principle finds practical expression in section 120 of the Succession Act 1965 which provides that a person who has been guilty of the murder, attempted murder or manslaughter of another shall be precluded from taking any share in the estate of that other person.<\/p> <p>A particular issue arises where the perpetrator and victim have been joint tenants of property such as the family home.  A joint tenancy is a form of co-ownership of property which is common among spouses and its distinguishing feature is the so-called right of survivorship.  It means, for example, that when a spouse who is a joint tenant of the family home dies, the surviving spouse automatically acquires the interest of the deceased spouse in the property and it does not form part of the estate of the deceased spouse.<\/p> <p>The high profile case to which Senator Quinn has already referred has drawn attention to certain features of the law applicable in this area which undoubtedly need to be reviewed.  In that case, the High Court found the surviving spouse did indeed acquire the interest of the deceased joint tenant in the property but went on to find that he was prevented under the rule which I have already mentioned from using these assets for his own benefit.  Instead, the High Court found that he held them in trust for the beneficiary of the deceased's estate.<\/p> <p>Arising from the uncertainties that came to light in this case, in December 2012 the Department of Justice and Equality suggested to the Law Reform Commission that this area of succession law needed to be reviewed and updated.  Accordingly, it asked the Commission to consider undertaking such a review in the context of its upcoming law reform programme.  The Minister is very pleased, therefore, that the commission decided to take the matter on board in the context of its current law reform programme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Gerald Nash:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2281\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> While the subject matter of Senator Quinn's Bill is paramount, it is not the only aspect of succession law that needs to be re-examined in the context of section 120 of the 1965 Act.  The Law Reform Commission published an issues paper in November last that sought views and submissions on no less than eight different aspects of section 120.<\/p><p>As Senator Higgins outlined, the deadline for the receipt of submissions was the end of January 2015.  The Minister understands that the commission has received a number of submissions containing a range of viewpoints in response to its issues paper and that it intends to prepare and publish a report containing specific recommendations for reform by July this year.<\/p><p>The backdrop, therefore, to the Government's approach to this Bill is the Law Reform Commission's current examination of eight different aspects of section 120 of the 1965 Act and the fact that the commission intends to submit comprehensive reform recommendations within a matter of months.  In light of this ongoing work, the Government does not wish to pre-empt matters by proceeding with a partial reform that may need to be reviewed again on receipt of all the commission's recommendations.  However, there is also the constitutional obstacle, which I mentioned earlier.  A key issue that arises in the context of joint tenancy cases is whether the perpetrator should not only lose his or her entitlement to the victim's interest in jointly owned assets but also forfeit his or her own interest in them.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn's Bill provides that where a joint tenant has been found guilty of the murder, attempted murder or manslaughter of the other co-owner, the joint tenancy shall be deemed to have been terminated with effect from the date of the offence.  This means that the surviving spouse would be precluded from benefiting from the estate of the deceased co-owner.  The Bill goes further by providing that the entire interest in the property shall be deemed to have been vested in the estate of the deceased, with effect from the date of the offence.  In short, the surviving spouse would also forfeit his or her own interest in the joint assets in favour of the estate of the deceased spouse.<\/p><p>It is at this point that issues relating to constitutionally protected property rights arise because the Constitution affords protection to the property rights of every citizen in both Article 40.3 and Article 43.  As Article 43 makes clear, the State may delimit the exercise of these rights \"with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.\"  In order to withstand legal challenge, any such delimitation requires a careful balancing of the competing rights involved.<\/p><p>The Law Reform Commission discusses the forfeiture option that forms part of Senator Quinn's Bill in its issues paper.  It notes that any solution would have to be compatible with the property rights in Articles 40.3 and 43.2 of the Constitution.  In this context, the commission draws attention to various statutory provisions which already provide for forfeiture of property and other assets that are the proceeds of crime.  Most notably, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 provides for the civil forfeiture of property and other assets that are the proceeds of crime.  Elsewhere, Part 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 allows the court to make confiscation orders where it considers that a person who has been found guilty of certain drug trafficking offences has benefited from the trafficking.<\/p><p>The commission notes that the Supreme Court has upheld the validity of such provisions on the basis that a person in possession of the proceeds of crime can have no constitutional grievance if deprived of their use.  However, the commission goes on to distinguish forfeiture of property and assets that derive from crime from forfeiture of property and assets of a person who has been convicted of the unlawful killing of his or her spouse but which are not derived from crime.  The clear objective of any criminal sanction imposed by the courts in such cases is to punish the perpetrator for his or her crime, but that is not the purpose of the forfeiture rule under succession law.  Its role is to ensure for sound public policy reasons that the perpetrator does not benefit from the crime; it does not seek to further punish by depriving the perpetrator of his or her legally owned assets.<\/p><p>One of the aspects of section 120 of the 1965 Act which the Law Reform Commission is reviewing is whether the existing forfeiture rule may act in an unduly harsh manner in certain cases.  As already mentioned, the full force of the rule applies in cases of manslaughter, even where the killing was accidental.<\/p><p>As the commission points out, the gravity of the crime of manslaughter and the moral culpability of the perpetrator may vary enormously depending on the circumstances.  In order to avoid the risk of injustice arising from rigid application of the forfeiture rule, some jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, have granted the courts a margin of discretion in applying it.  This is an aspect of section 120 on which the commission has sought submissions.<\/p><p>It is true that in past centuries, punitive sanctions were in force in this and similar jurisdictions that provided for mandatory forfeiture of the assets of those found guilty of felonies.  These were largely repealed towards the end of the 19th century in the Forfeiture Act 1870.  Some residual restrictions on the rights of prisoners to deal with their property remained in force in this jurisdiction until repealed by the Criminal Law Act 1997.  Since the enactment of that legislation, prisoners have been free to deal with their property while serving their sentences, using agents where necessary for practical reasons.<\/p><p>On a more technical level, Senator Quinn's Bill proposes to insert two new sections into the 1965 Act, one dealing with the case of a single surviving co-owner and the second with cases where there are two or more surviving co-owners.  However, this would probably be insufficient to achieve the Bill's stated objective without some reference to the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009.<\/p><p>As the High Court has noted, the law relating to co-owned land has been reformed in Part 7 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009.  In order to protect the rights of joint tenants, Part 7 makes it more difficult to sever a joint tenancy except with the prior consent in writing of the other joint tenant or tenants.  However, a court order may be sought to dispense with the consent requirement where it is considered that such consent is being unreasonably withheld.  It is probable, therefore, that any changes to section 120 of the 1965 Act would have to be accompanied by some reference to the provisions of Part 7 of the 2009 Act.<\/p><p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank Senator Quinn once again for raising this important public policy issue.  As I have mentioned, while the Government is supportive of the objectives of this Bill as it relates to the amendment of the law applicable in this area, it has decided to await the comprehensive reform recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, which are due for publication shortly, rather than proceeding with a partial reform of this important area of the law at this stage.<\/p><p>I reiterate to Senator Quinn and everyone else present, especially the families, that it is the Government's intention to bring forward legislation, based on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, later this year and to proceed quickly with enactment of that legislation.  I look forward to hearing the Senator's response to the approach I have outlined and the points I have made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#MM00300","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I applaud and compliment Senator Feargal Quinn for bringing forward this important legislation and generating debate.  The debate is overdue.  On many occasions in this House, Senator Quinn has been ahead of the Government in bringing forward relevant legislation.<\/p> <p>I extend my sympathy and that of the House to the family of the late Celine Cawley, whose death struck a chord with all of us.  It is only right and proper that the Government would introduce legislation to ensure that, in the future, no perpetrator of a murder or manslaughter will be able to benefit financially as a result of that crime.  I am encouraged and heartened by the response that the Minister of State made in the House this evening.  While he has indicated there are constitutional difficulties with the legislation as brought forward by Senator Quinn, it is the Government's intention to bring forward in the very near future, in the coming months, a comprehensive suite of legislation that will address the issue Senator Quinn wishes to have addressed through his Bill.  The Senator has certainly brought much clarity to the debate and conversation.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State, by liaising closely with the Senator, will ensure legislation of the kind the latter wishes to have enacted will cover all the eventualities he mentioned.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael Mullins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I urge the Minister to ensure that the commitments and timelines he indicated to the House will be honoured, and that the priority this legislation requires will be given to it.  No family should have to endure the trauma that the family in this case has endured, to see somebody who has been responsible from the death of a loved one benefit financially from that crime.  It is one of many families throughout the country who, on far too many occasions in the course of a year, have had to deal with the same crisis and the same awful crime.  We want to ensure that this loophole is closed before this Government leaves office and that there will never again be a situation where a family will have to expend significant amounts of money in the courts to try to have a wrong put right.  The only way it can be done is through legislation, and both this House and the D&aacute;il have the power to do that.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Quinn and congratulate him on this fine legislative measure.  Even if it needs improvement or adjustments here and there, I ask the Minister to ensure it will be part of the comprehensive suite of legislation to cover all of these issues, including those mentioned by Senator Mulcahy earlier.

The Construction Contracts Bill is one of the Bills I introduced some years ago.  It was enacted after three years but it has not yet been signed into law, so it is not performing as intended.  It greatly concerns me when I see how long it takes to get something done or for something to occur.<\/p><p>On the other hand, I get the sense that there might be a change.  The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill was before the House this morning, which was within 24 hours of the challenge in the court.  Hopefully we can move swiftly and get action on these matters.  The Minister mentioned July.  That is a date I can live with as it is just four months away.<\/p><p>It is a well established principle in law that a person should not be allowed to profit from his or her crime.  My firmly held belief is that our succession, property and, indeed, pensions laws must reflect that principle.  When considering a matter such as the one before us, we must put the victim at the centre of our consideration and not focus on the offender.  We must not cower at the mention of the Constitution.  The Constitution expressly says that property rights may be diluted in the exigencies of the common good.<\/p><p>Another Bill this House debated and passed was the Upward Only Rent (Clauses and Reviews) Bill.  It has not yet become law and part of the reason is that the Attorney General has said she is worried about some aspects of it.  The Attorney General appears to have influenced the Government regarding the Bill before the House today, and there have been many references to her views on it.  I remind Members that under the Standing Orders of this House the Attorney General has a right of audience here.  It would have been helpful if the Attorney General had come to the House today to elaborate on her position.  She could also have done that with the Upward Only Rent (Clauses and Reviews) Bill.  Those of us who proposed that Bill had been given strong opinions that the legislation was constitutional, but the Attorney General said she did not believe it was.  The Attorney General has a right of audience in this House and I would like her to come here on occasions such as this to give her view.<\/p><p>The authors of the Constitution never intended that a person could kill another person and then reap the financial rewards as a result.  While I recognise that this Bill pushes the boundaries, I do not accept that there are questions about the constitutionality of the proposals at its heart.  For now, we can agree to differ on this point.  I accept the Minister's bona fides when he indicates that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, will move swiftly to legislate in this area once the Law Reform Commission completes its work.  I can live with the July date.  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to bring this important matter before the House and, hopefully, to have inspired the Government to move towards a solution to this problem perhaps sooner than might otherwise have been the case.<\/p><p>I found it a challenge to develop this Bill.  It came about as a result of an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>by Miriam Keane, who is in the Visitors Gallery.  She is a lawyer in University College Dublin, UCD, and she advised me on the drafting of the Bill.  In her article she drew attention to the anomaly and said she believed we can do something about it, as something should be done.  We have heard from the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and we heard today from the Minister of State, Deputy Nash.  I thank the Minister of State and I particularly thank the officials, who also advised me on the Bill.  They have taken a position on the Bill which I can live with until July.  I do not have a very long finger, but it is one that can last for four months.  However, that is as far as it will go.  Hopefully, I will be able to say that before the recess in July we will have had the opportunity to debate this with the Law Reform Commission.  I thank the Minister and suggest that we adjourn the debate on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#OO00400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#OO00600","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1426069800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>At 12 p.m. on Tuesday, 24 March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015031100002#OO00700","speaker":"1134"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1426069800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 5 p.m. until noon on Tuesday, 24 March 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
