I will first talk briefly about the trends in the sector and current performance, go on to look at some opportunities and, finally, document for the committee the Teagasc response to the situation in which the tillage sector finds itself.<\/p><p>I start with an arresting chart on which we show average family farm income across the main Irish enterprises for the period 2013 to 2016.  The most recent data available from the national farm survey is from 2016.  This is the chart to which I come back time and time again because it points to the huge challenge faced by the tillage sector, albeit not only by that sector.  That said, the contrast between an average family farm income, which includes direct payments, of &euro;55,000 for dairying and &euro;30,000 for tillage highlights the gap that exists now but which, traditionally, was much narrower.  On top of that, members will of course be aware that the single farm payment has become increasingly important to the incomes of tillage farmers.  On average over the period, it came to approximately 75%.  As such, that graph is the one which is of most concern to us and, I am sure, to tillage farmers.<\/p><p> I move on to some other facts about the sector.  It is a relatively small sector, accounting for approximately 9% of farm land.  The area under tillage has been decreasing over the last five years as members will see from the chart setting out the trend at the bottom of page 2 of the slides document.  It has declined by just over 14% over the last five years.  We estimate that there are currently 3,000 specialised tillage farmers.  Production is between 2.2 million to 2.5 million tonnes per annum and the product is used predominantly for animal feed but also for malting for brewing, some food grade oats and oils and some milling wheat.  From the point of the view of the agronomics of the sector, it is classified very much as high input, high output.  One of the paradoxes to some extent and something which often interests people from outside the country in particular is the fact that we have some of the highest yields in the world.  As against that, however, we have very high costs of production.  Of course, the other distinguishing feature of the sector, which has given rise to some difficulty in recent years with the competition for land, is the large area which is leased.  It is of the order of 50% of the area sown.<\/p><p> Overleaf on page 3, our document provides some favour of what has been happening at county level.  Members will see that between 2007 and 2016 most counties experienced significant declines in area, notably Cork, Kilkenny and Wexford, albeit with some exceptions on the other side of the graph, in particular in County Meath.  The diagram at the bottom of page 3 emphasises the point that we are substantial net importers of product.  Members will see that the gap set out in the final bar for 2015 is between a use of approximately 6 million tonnes and a production level of between 2 million and 2.5 million tonnes.  The graph at the top of page 4 shows that we are price takers when it comes to cereals.  The world market dictates the price situation, especially having regard to the issue of stocks, which have been on the increase.  That has put tremendous price pressure on an already tight world demand and supply situation.<\/p><p> As far as the current harvest is concerned, Teagasc advisors have kept a constant watch over the season.  This year, we consider that yields have been relatively good, but not exceptional.  The cereal harvest is, we are happy to say, almost complete.  There is approximately 5% left to be harvested.  In some parts of the country, however, there are significant areas which still face difficulties, in particular Donegal, the west and some parts of the midlands.<\/p><p>Trafficability and crop breakdown are emerging issues.  We estimate about 30% of beans are left to be harvested and 20% of straw is still to be baled nationally.  Of course, we are all aware of the price of straw, and some quality issues have also been reported.<\/p><p> In summary, while this sector has faced and is facing severe challenges, there are also opportunities.  I would emphasise that these opportunities are largely emerging in niche areas and we are endeavouring to identify premium markets.  For example, there may well be a development around &ldquo;Irish only&rdquo; product, which is something Teagasc has been looking at.  In the drink sector, there are opportunities in distilling, although that gives raise to particular technical challenges for the producer, and also around craft beers.  Increasingly, as the committee is aware, in markets for some of our main export products, for example, the German market, consumers are looking for genetic modification-free, GM-free products, which presents an opportunity for the grain sector.  I am happy to say there are opportunities emerging around human food grade markets, such as oats and cold-pressed oils.  We include the potato sector within the overall tillage sector and opportunities are emerging around chipping and salad potatoes.  Certified seed crops also present opportunities.<\/p><p> Looking to the future, there are certainly opportunities around organic products.  We consider this to be a niche area but there is definitely a market for some crops.  Unfortunately, we are all too aware that when price pressure emerges, in particular during economic downturns, there tends to be a convergence between the organic and the conventionally produced.  I have mentioned the issue around genetically modified, GM, crops.  As the committee is aware, imported GM products continue to be fed to animals but no GM crops are grown in Ireland.  As I said, a consumer issue is emerging in some of our main markets regarding GM-free produce.  We certainly foresee that the dairy sector will have to respond to this demand for GM-free.<\/p><p> The Teagasc response is to work with partners in the industry, particularly with our producer clients and the processing sector.  From a research perspective, we are of course looking at yield and sustainability of cereal crops in all their dimensions, not just economic or environmental.  We are looking at the opportunities that might exist for alternative crops for import substitution and higher value markets.  We are looking to develop higher value end uses for cereals, and I have already mentioned the opportunities that exist for distilling.  Of course, we are always striving to produce better and more robust varieties, and there are some very exciting approaches in the molecular sciences that will assist this process.  Of course, one can have the best research in the world, but without good advice it will not be effective.  Again, the emphasis is continuously on increasing adoption of best technology to reduce costs, to produce more sustainably and to produce product that the market requires.  We are working closely with industry to target programmes around areas that are emerging and growing in importance, such as malting barley, potatoes and distilling.<\/p><p> We would emphasise the importance of training our young farmers.  It is a very demanding sector and education is essential.  We want to develop the role of new technologies.  Again, I want to emphasise the great potential we see for improving the breeding of new varieties through marker assisted and genomic selection, which is now being used to increase the rate of varietal improvement.<\/p><p>There is huge interest among scientists all over the world in the potential that the novel technology of gene editing offers, and we believe it has the potential to increase significantly the rate of varietal improvement.  The role of GIS technology is being investigated.  We have produced the so-called nutrient management planning online tool, which is allowing us to focus on the extraordinary variability that exists in yields and in the application of nutrients at field level.  That will enable us not only to improve average yields but also to improve the costs in terms of chemical application of fertilisers.  We are going to see much more precision in the application of nutrients, which will have positive environmental and economic effects.  We are even seeing the use of handheld devices to detect unseen diseases to target early responses better.<\/p><p> We think it is important to emphasise the potential for the bio-economy, although this will depend hugely on the appropriate incentives being in place.  After a number of years when this sector was somewhat in the doldrums, we hope the impending renewable heat incentive will provide a new fillip to the opportunities that exist.  There is no doubt that, without support, the industry will continue to stagnate due to a lack of investment and the opportunities that exist in this important sector may not be fully realised.<\/p><p> That is a summary of our presentation.  My two colleagues will answer all the hard questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Boyle for a very thought-provoking presentation.

We move to questions.

I have a number of questions.  First, with regard to the single farm payment, we are going into another review of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  Has any analysis been done of, say, the Irish experience with a 10% or 15% reduction in premia and the impact this would have on the future of the sector?  We had a number of groups in here last week and they were extremely pessimistic about where the whole industry is going.  We talked about niche markets, Jameson and all the different craft beers that we are now producing, but the tonnage that is needed for that is probably very low in the overall context.  How much would that industry need in terms of market share to have a significant impact on the tonnage we are producing?  Flahavan's are paying a serious premium price for oats.  What kind of tonnage can that market absorb?<\/p> <p>  While it might not be fair to ask Teagasc about this, I have a question about barley.  When I was young, to have a malting contract was a prized possession but the value of that seems to have gone out the window, as it were.  To link malting barley with feed barley as regards price seems a contradiction in terms because they are going to different markets.  Surely the price mechanism for calculating what malting barley is worth should not have any synchronisation with feed barley.<\/p> <p>  Biomass is increasingly becoming a topic for us.  We have our targets to meet by 2021 and if we do not meet them, we are going to suffer significant penalties.<\/p><p>We have not even started to go the way we should with regard to biomass.  Our stocking rate is probably at 50% of capacity in terms of the utilisation or our land.  It is 80 kg per hectare, and with a derogation it is 170 kg.  If we devoted 20% of our land to the production of biomass, how much could it do for the whole cereal and tillage sector?  We could grow sugar beet or break crops such as elephant grass, or miscanthus, but it would be very hard to get a conventional tillage farmer to buy into them.  Anyone who did so in the past couple of years was badly bitten but conventional tillage crops can have a role to play in meeting our climate change targets.  There was a good conference in Gurteen recently but we need a far greater emphasis on the potential of biomass.<\/p><p> My next question is on the potential for us to produce GM-free dairy products for the market place.  I have worries over our ability to go down that route and maintain a competitive production base with other countries but can we produce enough protein to be independent?  If we go the GM-free route, will be able to produce enough feed for our dairy and beef industry?  Organics give a premium but when a market gets saturated that premium goes out the window.  We would be competing with countries that were not on the same thoroughfare so would we be able to keep our competitive advantage?  At the moment the price is in a relatively good place but slumps will come.  Consumers are starting to push us down the GM-free route but price is the common denominator and I wonder if we might leave ourselves in a very vulnerable position in terms of our cost base.<\/p><p> I welcome the presentation.  This industry is at a serious crossroads and what has worked in the past is not going to work in the future.  When the report comes out I would love to hear grain men or tillage men say they can see light at the end of the tunnel, perhaps a five-year or ten-year roadmap to a decent market for our products at a reasonable price.  The graph of world markets shown in the presentation does not look like it can give a lifeline to our tillage sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#P00300","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation from Teagasc.  I agree with the policy on food but does it have a GM policy in the area of energy crops?  There is a difference in the end user in this case.  Grain growers and farmers' organisations were before the committee last week.  I am from the midlands and some of my neighbours, as well as people in the west and north west, have been badly affected.  While not necessarily losing their full crop, they have lost straw and by the time they got around to cutting their grain it was probably not worth cutting.  If they were to knock on the witnesses' doors for advice, based on what has happened in the past two years when they have lost their harvest, in what direction would they send them?  What advice would the witnesses give them in the area of diversification?  There might be five good years of weather but we cannot say that as we cannot predict the weather.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#Q00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses and welcome the presentation.  There is a huge discrepancy in single farm payments across the country, from &euro;150,000 to &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000.  Do they think they need to be sorted out to keep family farms more buoyant?  Being realistic, conditions in some parts of the country are such that a lot of people are going to pull out of the grain sector.  Professor Boyle spoke about the RHI and new ways of creating energy.  Does he agree that marginal land is not fit to grow willow, or some of the crops about which people are dreaming?  Does he think the RHI should only be paid for what is produced, reared or sown in Ireland?  What is his view on tillage sector incomes, which are going down?  What is his view on biogas from silage?  I know Teagasc is doing research on this but would it be more viable for some people than others?<\/p> <p>  What research is Teagasc doing into craft beers?  I was at a few events in Dublin and it is clear that people in the sector are making a lot of effort to get their beers known and exported.  In either New Zealand or Australia they have developed a type of grain which is unique but costs &euro;1,200 because it is wanted everywhere.  What work has Teagasc done into this type of thing, where the farmer would not be the price taker and the sector would benefit?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses spoke of large fines coming down the line.  Do they agree we are in a bit of trouble with biomass?  A lot of it appears not to be efficient to grow.  I feel that the guy in the suit or the guy with the biro gets more from tillage sector knowledge transfer, whether in respect of beef or sheep, than the farmer who gets &euro;400 or &euro;500.

The knowledge group schemes are a different matter and I am well aware of the issues that have arisen but I am talking about the relationship advisers have with farmers on a day-to-day basis.<\/p> <p>  Deputies Fitzmaurice and Cahill raised the difficulties around the single farm payment.  We carried out analysis of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy a couple of years ago, and will do more when the scenarios firm up a bit more.  It is not fully appreciated but the tillage sector was revealed to have, proportionately, the single greatest negative impact.  Some 75% of family farm income is accounted for by the single farm payment.  Any cut in that, such as has been mooted in the event of a hard Brexit, would reflect this.<\/p><p>If a hard Brexit were to occur, there would be approximately the same or a little less negative impact on family farm income.  Family farm income is essentially the net margin, having substracted from revenue all variable and fixed costs and added the single farm payment.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice asked a question about the distribution of payments that I am reluctant to answer directly because it involves a political issue.  I am well aware of the debate in that regard and the discussions taking place on capping and so on which is at the core of the Deputy's question.  We can analyse the impact of different caps, but it is not really our business to comment on where the cap should be or if there should be one.  In particular, we would be concerned about the impact of any reform on the productive commercial sector of Irish agriculture.

Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice also mentioned craft beers and high value grains.  The value of grain in Ireland is linked with commodity markets which are largely driven by maize in terms of grain or soy in terms of proteins and horse feed.  It is worth remembering that on a worldwide basis they are both predominantly genetically-modified, GM, crops; therefore, Irish producers of conventional crops are competing in markets that are set by GM crops.  As Professor Boyle said, we are trying to identify premium markets, in particular when the product is marketed as having been made only from Irish ingredients, which means that it has to be sourced in Ireland, not on world commodity markets.  Therefore, the value of the grain or tillage product used to make the product is linked with its end value.  Tonnages in some high value markets are currently very small, but because we have a small tillage sector, if we find suitable export markets, we could export large quantities of our produce to high value markets and make very little impact on global markets.  A big increase in our oat crop exports would have very little impact on a global scale, but it would add a lot more value here.  We are considering such measures.<\/p> <p>  We have not developed a variety of grain worth &euro;1,200 per tonne, but I wish we had.  A reason we have an interest in the drinks sector is that the alcohol yield of a grain is inversely related to its protein content.  Our niche in Ireland is producing high-starch, low-protein grains and, therefore, higher alcohol yields than one would get from most grains.  That is one reason we are particularly interested in that sector.  If we could get a price of &euro;1,200 per tonne, we would be delighted.<\/p> <p>  In relation to GM-free dairy products, we want to be competitive and need to consider whether we can produce enough feed and be competitive on price.  A group within Teagasc is examining this issue.  We could not produce enough protein to replace all of what we import.  The analysis is ongoing.  At current prices, one could formulate a ration of oilseed rape meal and beans, for example, for a slightly higher price than an all-GM ration, but if demand for dairy and meat products from non-GM-fed animals was to increase, the cost of these commodities would also increase.  Currently it is a relatively small increase, but the analysis is ongoing and the price could change if there was more demand for animal produce from animals fed on non-GM crops.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Spink"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507046400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Senator Paul Daly asked a pertinent question about the advice that would be given to a farmer in the west who had had two particularly poor years and what he or she could do next year and the year after that.  It is tricky enough because there are several rules, including greening rules and so on, that have forced some such farmers to grow crops that might not be as good as they would like or would ordinarily pick.  Certain crops stand better.  When a farmer has a poor year, he or she has a much longer period to harvest the crop.  There are good and bad farmers in all sectors and Teagasc could bring the Senator to meet many farmers in the west who have managed to get their crops in on time because of the crop mix they use.  There may be a mix of winter and spring crops that suit the relevant land.  What crop suits a particular piece of land has to be considered on a farm to farm basis.  Some such farmers have the necessary machinery, expertise and knowledge, but weather was the big thing that was against them.  However, in a normal year they tend to get on reasonably well.  There is much we can do, but we cannot do a lot about the weather.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice asked about land that was fit to grow willow.  No matter what land is in question, good land will produce a good crop, whether it be grass, willow or grain.  The better the land, the better the crop that will be produced from it.  That is universal for all crops.  Willow is capable of being grown on wetter land, but the wetter the land, the poorer the yields one will get.  Willow is very much on the conventional side of the house in terms of GM crops.  Programmes in Scandinavia, in particular, have shown that willow is outclassed in yield over a period of time; after about 15 years it will be outclassed and will have to be replanted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#T00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Hennessey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507046400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>On the GM-free issue, I agree completely with Mr. Spink that there are cost implications.  The preliminary indications are that they are not significant at current prices, but it would be a big assumption to rely on this because prices will change, as Mr Spink said.  If consumers demand such a product and competitor products are labelled as such, we may not have a choice, which is why it is a matter of urgency for Teagasc to identify what alternatives are available to dry stock and, in particular, dairy farmers.<\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked an interesting question about our position on GM crops and the growing of energy crops.  We have no position other than a desire to comply with the law and current departmental policy.  Irrespective of use, the growing of GM crops is not permitted in Ireland.  There are risks of contamination with non-GM strains and so on and they would cross over to crops that could be fed to both animals and humans.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice asked whether the RHI should be limited to Irish-grown crops.  That is a matter for policymakers to determine.<\/p><p>In my view, given our limited resources, for any such scheme we should look to promote our own sector.  There was an interesting question about the production of biogas from silage.  We are about to commission an anaerobic digester for research purposes at our Grange site.  It is a system that operates on both slurry and grass silage.  The best alternative for grass is to use it in the production of livestock products but for an individual farmer with less livestock than is optimal, it may be an opportunity.

As the Chairman said, some 50% of land is leased in one form or another.  There has been a big change in the past five years, on the back of the change in the taxation status of rented land.  A tax-free allowance is available for a long-term lease, that is, anything over five years and up to 20 years.  For a husband and wife, the maximum is &euro;80,000 so it is very significant.  It has brought good and bad things for the tillage farmer.  Much more conacre land, with one-year rentals, has been converted into long-term leases.  This is probably no more than 20% of the total but it has increased quite a lot.  It has brought disadvantages too, including the fact that the dairy sector has the option of longer-term leases and they now offer 15-year leases, which are attractive to farmers converting from tillage or on grassland.  However, they are competing with the tillage farmer for access to land and the latter cannot increase his profits or output unless he gets more land so the price has crept up steadily.  In real terms, it has probably gone up by between &euro;30 and &euro;50 over the past four or five years.  It is also because of competition from young farmers who are looking for a way into farming along with entitlements, both of which go hand in hand and require a longer-term lease.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about viability.  Teagasc is worn out telling farmers not to do certain things for the past 35 years but the farmers have continued to do them nonetheless.  Some have made a good success of it but others have certainly not.  The pool of land is now getting smaller, however, and the level of tillage land is getting smaller, which is putting more pressure on the system.

It depends on whether the land is owned or leased.  Some would argue that a dairy farmer can run a farm with 80 cows, others would suggest it needs 120 but it depends on where it is.  For a tillage farmer on his own, one could argue it would be 600 or 700 acres but it depends on how much he owns and how much he does not own.  A farmer who wants to make a very good living and to have a big single farm payment would probably need closer to 1,000 acres than 500.<\/p> <p>  Another question was on the negative effects of greening.  When it came out, there were a lot of rules and regulations stating what farmers had to and could not do.  Compliance on the part of farmers on the ground has been extremely high, however, and there have been fewer than 100 breaches of the greening rules.  It has, however, made a bit of a difference to a number of different farmers.  They used to block land for winter wheat for one year and for another crop in following years, but they now have to subdivide it into different sections for the number of crops in a particular year.<\/p><p>That is adding costs.  How many farmers is this happening to?  The smaller farmers - those with fewer than 30 acres - are losing out while the bigger guys have more than three crops anyway.  The big guys have more than enough environmentally-friendly areas, EFAs.  They need 5%.  The average is approximately 7.5% and most have more than 12% so it is not a big issue for them.

We have done some work over the past couple of years with Beet Ireland and looked at the yield potential of new sugar beet varieties since the industry stopped ten or more years ago and there has been a big increase in the yield potential of beet in that time, with improved varieties, etc.  That is certainly a positive but the world price of sugar is currently relatively low, at some &euro;350 per tonne.  A lot of the predictions of four years ago envisaged between &euro;500 and &euro;600.

On behalf of the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, I thank the Chairman and committee members for giving us the opportunity to come and speak today.<\/p> <p>  The complete land area under organic production in Ireland is 73,000 ha, which equates to just under 2% of agricultural land.  Of that 2%, 94% is in permanent grassland and 2.2% is in cereal production.  This is a very low ratio compared to organic livestock production and other processing requirements.  We have a high dependency on imported cereals in order to meet specific market demands.<\/p> <p>  There are obvious opportunities for Irish tillage farmers to consider converting to organic production and we will highlight some of those to the committee this evening.  Last year, the land area under organic tillage was just over 2,200 ha.  Even though this is an increase of 650 ha on the previous year, it is not sufficiently large to keep up with demand.  No tranche of the organic farming scheme has been opened since 2015 as, apparently, there is no funding available in the RDP but Ireland has an existing policy target of 5% organic production, although we only allocate sufficient funds to support 2% of production.<\/p><p>Even with the limited funding - we fully understand we need to work within budgets - the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, IOFGA, firmly believes that a targeted scheme, which incidentally is 75% co-funded by the EU, needs to be reopened, especially if we are to supply the current deficit with home-grown product.  Otherwise we rely on importing cereals that can be grown here, which is simply not economically sensible or sustainable.<\/p><p> Oats represent the largest organic cereal crop in Ireland, not barley, as is the case in the conventional sector.  Oats account for 60% of organic cereal production, barley 13%, wheat 9% and protein crops 6%.  Oats are a valuable cash crop, with over 50% going directly into porridge oatlets for a growing domestic and international market.  The leading industry manufacturer has already stated it has at the very least a 2,000-tonne deficit every year to meet the current supply and requires much more product.  There are also valuable industries using grain such as milling, brewing and distilling, all of which have a massive and growing demand for organic cereals.  There is also a demand for organic protein crops.  The protein aid scheme has boosted the production of protein crops.  However, organic systems find it very difficult to grow a single protein crop.  They tend to opt for a combi-crop whereby there is a mix of 40% to 50% protein.  Nevertheless, it is once again an important source of protein to reduce dependence on imports.<\/p><p> IOFGA prepared a submission for the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, which was very well received, requesting that organic farmers growing protein via combi-crops be paid a proportional support from the protein aid scheme as many fall outside the protein aid criteria.  We look forward to seeing this introduced before the next growing season.  Organic tillage production does not have the same high cost base associated with conventional tillage, naturally enough, as chemical inputs are not allowed.  That said, the yields are lower in organic production, with an average yield of around 2.5 tonnes per acre - that is 5 tonnes per hectare - but with most organic crops returning a gross margin of between &euro;700 and &euro;1,000 per hectare, that is a profitable enterprise.  In 2015 the organic farming scheme saw just over 500 new entrants to the sector, over 90% of whom were livestock farmers, increasing the feed demand significantly.  We estimate that approximately 6,000 tonnes of organic grain are being produced in Ireland at present but we need an extra 10,000 ha of land to convert to organic farming even to begin to supply the current Irish demand, and that is not including future needs for farmers or processors.  Therefore, the lack of supply is certainly a barrier to the expansion of the sector and one which has been identified in the national organic action plan.<\/p><p> Regarding future organic regulations, albeit not yet finalised, there will be more onus for feedstock to be sourced regionally, giving some market opportunities for home-grown organic grains.  This, combined with compliance with high-level policy targets such as pesticide regulations and the Water Framework Directive - we will not even get into the impact of Brexit on trade - makes organic an attractive option for many tillage farmers.  While there are economically sound opportunities to increase organic cereal production to meet the deficit in supply, a new targeted scheme is needed to respond to the rapidly increasing market and there is certainly a very clear indication that this issue will not go away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Gillian Westbrook","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Westbrook.

The Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, ABFI, is an umbrella organisation encompassing our category associations such as the Irish Whiskey Association, the Irish Spirits Association, of which William Lavelle, who is here with me today, is the head, the Irish Brewers Association, the Irish Cider Association and the Irish Wine Association.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, the reason we in the drinks sector have been invited here today is that we are viewed as a growing sector.  In terms of our economic exports, the growth has been phenomenal.  Bord Bia states that last year we increased exports by 4% to &euro;1.4 billion.  According to the CSO data already available for this year, we have seen an increase of 18.5% in exports of Irish whiskey, which is now the fastest-growing spirits category in the world.  We are therefore very much of the perspective that this is a very big cake.<\/p><p>Irish whiskey comprises only 5% of the overall whiskey market and there is plenty of opportunity for growth into the future, given the right conditions.  We are committed to working with the Minister and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on Food Wise 2025.  In this regard we have agreed to try to increase exports by 85% but we think we will actually almost double that within the timeframe if, again, conditions are right.<\/p><p> Regarding the economic benefits, an unusual aspect of our sector is that we are dotted right around the island of Ireland.  As far as new production is concerned, four years ago we had four distilleries but now we have 18 in operation and 16 more in planning, and they are right around the island of Ireland.  ABFI as an organisation is all-island because our geographical indicators which protect Irish whiskey, Irish cream and Irish poteen are all-island, so we operate on that basis.<\/p><p> As for our strategy regarding delivery on our vision for Irish whiskey, we estimate that we will bring 1,500 new jobs into the sector.  This story also benefits Irish farmers when it comes to both the breweries and the distilleries.  There is a huge demand for Irish agricultural suppliers to source malted barley and unmalted grains, as well as fresh Irish cream, used in Irish cream liqueurs, and apples, which are used in cider.  We purchase 60% of our raw materials in Ireland and create a major multiplier effect as a result, much more than, for example, the multinational sector.  It is estimated that for every job created in the drinks manufacturing sector, four additional jobs are created.<\/p><p> Specifically regarding tillage, the drinks industry purchases about 10% of Ireland's annual harvest and the vast majority of Irish brewers and distillers are committed to purchasing their barley and malt locally.  At present, we purchase more than 200,000 tonnes of barley every year.  The current growth is leading to an increase in demand for both unmalted grain and malted barley, and more of this demand will be met from domestic sources.  I will give the committee just three examples from three of our largest drink producers.  Diageo uses more than 130,000 tonnes of barley each year at St. James's Gate, and 300 tonnes every day just to brew Guinness.  Diageo buys approximately 13% of Ireland's total annual domestic production of barley.  Heineken Ireland sources all of its malted barley from 750 Irish farmers.  Irish Distillers seeks to purchase all its malted and unmalted barley from Ireland, much of which comes from a very local radius of about 100 miles of the Midleton distillery.  It is, however, necessary at times for Irish whiskey producers to source maize from further afield as Ireland does not have the climate to produce maize in the quantities needed for our production process.  The three producers I have listed are just some of many now.  We have a burgeoning membership and a burgeoning industry.  For example, Walsh Whiskey and O'Hara Brewery in Carlow, the Shed Distillery in Drumshanbo, Teelings Whiskey in Dublin's Liberties, Tullamore D.E.W. and many more have signed up to Bord Bia's Origin Green scheme.  Under this scheme, the producers have specifically made commitments to source more grain and raw material locally.  For example, the Shed Distillery has committed to sourcing 100% of its grain from Origin Green suppliers.  We think it is a fantastic initiative.<\/p><p> Irish drinks producers are trying to innovate and produce new products, which means they must work closely with growers and merchants to improve quality, efficiency and sustainability.  What is key is reliable, secure production.  In the context of trying to innovate, we are looking at different things.  For example, Irish Distillers has recently launched a project experimenting with rye blends grown locally.  I think we will see more such examples follow through.  As more and more people bring new product, there is more opportunity to look at recipe, whereas with traditional recipes it is harder to diversify the grain mix.<\/p><p> Last week, ABFI had a general meeting with the Minister, Deputy Creed, at which we briefly discussed this issue.  We have already requested a further meeting with the Department to examine what additional opportunities there are for the Irish drinks industry to collaborate.  We are very interested in innovation and research proposals regarding Irish grain usage in brewing and distilling.  We are very positive about it.  I think the members are willing to look at funding of research and innovation and we look forward to exploring that further with the Department, Teagasc and anyone else who may be interested.<\/p><p> We are conscious of the difficulties the committee has heard from other witnesses before us that face Irish grain farmers and we are supportive of calls from farm organisations for a Government plan to revitalise the tillage sector.  At the same time as I have given the committee our good news story, we are aware there are threats on the horizon.  Brexit is an obvious one but we have two specific threats to the drinks sector in Ireland which I would like to touch on briefly.<\/p><p>The basic message is that if our industry is growing, so will that of tillage farmers because we will need more supply.  However, anything that could damage our overall growth and projections will be problematic.  Growth should not be taken for granted in any industry and certainly not in ours.<\/p><p> We have an issue with the Government's Public Health (Alcohol) Bill that will shortly be before the Legislature in terms of it providing for a blanket ban on the marketing and advertisement of drinks products.  That would be particularly damaging for start-ups as they would never be able to build brands in the Irish market, although it would be essential to do so before they could go on to export their products.  The Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, ABFI, would like to see workable legislation.  As was mentioned in reference to barley farmers, our current advertisements might show an orchard or a farmer in a field.  That would be banned by the Bill and we would not be able to show a person or a location other than the production process.  Breaking that link to our heritage and rural supply chain would be damaging for us.  I flag that to members and ask for their assistance in getting legislation that businesses can work with and that will deliver the public health objectives.<\/p><p> The budget will be announced next week and many others are probably more involved in it than we are, but Ireland has the second highest excise duty in the EU on alcohol and that is very damaging to our industry, especially so in the context of Brexit and the North-South divide.  The devaluation of sterling has already put strain on our exports.<\/p><p> Those are the impending threats to the drinks industry.  The broad vision for the sector is very positive, but if companies' ability to compete is hampered and there is not a supportive home market, there will be less investment in spite of the contribution of the many start-up businesses because a significant portion of them have foreign investment backing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I welcome both groups to the committee.

Is that because organic farming involves more difficult husbandry such that farmers are afraid of it and do not want to go down that road or is the price, which seems high, not high enough to compensate for those difficulties?<\/p><p>In regard to the drinks sector, I know the Shed Distillery very well as it is beside where I live in Leitrim.  It is a great success story and is doing great work there.<\/p><p> Members would expect the drinks industry to aim to source all its grain in Ireland.  If a drinks company that wanted to label its product as Irish had to use Irish ingredients, would that cause a problem due to insufficient raw material being produced here?  Most people would think it logical that if one were to say a product is Irish water, that water would have to come from Ireland, or if one were to call a product Irish whiskey, at least a fair proportion of its raw materials would have to be sourced in Ireland.  However, the question is whether sufficient materials can be produced here.  If that is not the case, it comes back to the point made by Senator Daly as to whether farmers are not being offered a good enough price to produce them.  I do not drink very much but what little I do is very dear.  That is the same for everyone.  The vast majority of people would not begrudge the farmer an extra 0.1% on the price of a pint.  If one goes into a bar after 12 midnight the price goes up and then a little later the price goes up again because publicans have to pay staff extra.  There needs to be joined-up thinking to come up with a solution. There has to be one if there is a sector as successful and with such potential as the Irish drinks industry and also a farming sector that has the potential to provide for that but cannot do so because it is not being adequately compensated.  I want to get the witnesses' views on where a solution may lie.  Does somebody need to put their hand deeper into their pocket?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#AA00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  My questions will focus on similar issues to those addressed by Senator Daly and Deputy Kenny.  In view of some of the presentations given to the committee last week that portrayed a sector in dire financial straits with acreage dropping by 14% over the past couple of years, it is hard to comprehend why the lifeline for a certain number of producers who could produce grain organically and get a viable commercial price for it is not being taken.  Very good commercial prices were quoted by Flahavan's for oats and yet there is a deficit in the production of oats.  What roadblock is stopping farmers?  They are usually very good at making good economic decisions.  What is stopping farmers changing to organic farming from conventional tillage farming which everyone agrees is not paying?  The witness said there is a severe shortfall or deficit in every sector, so what is the roadblock or what needs to be done in order that a sector of tillage farmers would be able to make a viable income?<\/p> <p>  It was said that 60% of raw materials used by the drinks industry is purchased in Ireland.  That seems a very low figure for an industry that portrays itself as wholly Irish.  Kerrygold butter is 100% produced in this country and marketed as such.  However, it is disingenuous if whiskeys and craft beers are being marketed as Irish but only 60% of their ingredients come from Ireland.  That figure seems extremely low for a product to be labelled as completely Irish.<\/p> <p>  A point was made by Senator Daly and Deputy Kenny regarding the end product and how one will pay over &euro;5 for a pint of Guinness but the person producing the grain will only get 4 cent or 5 cent of that.  If there were a graph before the committee showing the relative division of the final consumer price of a pint, as one often sees, one would hardly be able to see the section showing the portion for the tillage farmer because it would be so small.  The ABFI gave figures showing the drinks industry has expanded rapidly in recent years and said that distilleries and breweries have been springing up all over the country, and that is welcome.  However, if it is serious about developing the industry in the future, the person producing the raw material has to see a future in it for him or her.<\/p><p>If we are to create a niche market for Irish whiskey and niche Irish craft beers, we need to source the raw material as far as practically possible in Ireland.  <\/p><p> We must take action to rectify what is happening at present, as evidenced from the graph.  The man producing the raw material is not being paid a viable return for his produce.  I would like the industry to focus on the percentage of the raw material that is produced in Ireland and whether the current level of 60% will be increased to a figure in the high nineties, let us say above 95%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#BB00200","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, IOFGA, for the presentation.  Do the representatives think that many small farmers - those with ten to 16 ha - left organic farming because it was more attractive to participate in the GLAS scheme?  This has happened all over the country and I see in my area the farmers have walked away from organic farming.  There was also the differential between the prices being charged by the licensing authorities compared to the cost of drawing up a GLAS plan.  When the farmers did the sums they would find that they would be better off by &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,500 per year by being in GLAS as opposed to farming organically.  Is that the major problem face by IOFGA?<\/p> <p> The Department was asked to reduce the acreage needed to farm organically to try to retain the smaller operators, but it did not accede to the request because the Department said it wanted to meet the targets.  It is clear from the figures supplied that we are not meeting the targets we set ourselves.<\/p> <p>  When one looks at the different sectors of agriculture it appears that farmers prefer to have livestock.  Why is that?  Most of the farmers I know bring their cattle to the commercial marts rather than to special sales because they get the same price.  Why is the organic producer not getting a premium price?  Are we not marketing our product sufficiently?<\/p> <p>  When farmers supply to the drinks industry, they are price takers.  If one keeps telling a producer that they are a price taker, they will get fed up of taking the price because they will go out of business.  The industry needs the raw material.  I concur with every other member that if one is selling Irish whiskey, all the raw materials should be Irish and should not be mixed with crops from other countries.  Why does the drinks industry not do a five or ten year plan to guarantee security of product?  We have the figures that the raw materials cost in the region of 5 cent in the pint.  It does not matter whether it would be 6 cent or 7 cent, but that additional 2 cent would give a premium price to the farmer and buy in to doing a deal with the industry down the road.  Why does the industry not do that rather than every year bantering over a few pounds with people walking away from supplying the raw material?  The industry could ensure the security of supply of the raw materials.<\/p> <p>  It is great to see that in County Roscommon an announcement was made that planning permission  is being sought for a new whiskey distillery.  This is happening around the country.  However, we must remember that if we keeping pulling a dog's tail, he will bite.   What is happening is that if the industry wrangles every year and farmers have to take a low price, the industry will lose them. <\/p> <p>  The industry is portraying the product as Irish, grown in a clean environment and everything is done in Ireland, but in fact the company is bringing in most of the organic produce from Poland and other countries that are the bread basin of the world.  Why will the industry not do a deal with Irish producers instead of engaging in a ding-dong every year?  That is not helping the industry.  If the different pieces of the jigsaw are not in place, that will not help the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#CC00200","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice.

The cost of malting barley is around &euro;180 a tonne.  There is a demand for the raw material, but it is about getting enough people to come in for conversion.  That ties up with Deputy Cahill's question about why more people are not coming in to supply the raw material.  For a start, there is a 60 ha cap, and if one wants more tillage farmers to enter the market, one must raise the cap higher than 60 ha.  For example, the limit in Wales is 300 ha.  That is not for tillage - it is more sheep production - but the size is significantly bigger.  Very few EC countries put a cap on the amount of land that will gain support under the scheme.  Granted under the organic farming scheme one will get a less support for bringing more land into the scheme, but it would be a big boost for the tillage farmer to remove that cap.<\/p> <p>  In response to questions from Senator Daly and Deputy Cahill, there is also a two year conversion, which puts quite a few farmers off as well, which is a regulatory requirement and must happen.  Taking account of the two year conversion period, one would only produce for three years of the five year period.  One would have to measure the return over a ten year period.<\/p> <p>  Organic farming is very much demand led.  Half of the land area would be in rotation to build up fertility in the soil, so the product will not necessarily be giving back a yield year in year out.  Therefore, pretty much half of the land will be in rotation.  The really successful organic tillage farmers, all of whom give me examples of land that is stockless, generally speaking have farms that are mixed enterprises, with beef and tillage in order to build up the fertility allowing them to use the land that is not in cereal production for those periods.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill raised the issue of the road block.  We do not have a coherent strategy for organic production and I would say that is the cause of the block.  We tend to get merged in with Origin Green and different organisations such as that, which is fine up to a point, but we need a coherent marketing and promotion plan specifically for organic production.<\/p> <p>  To put it bluntly, sometimes there is a them and us division which can come from the organic side and which is not helpful.  The product must be seen as an Irish produce for which there is a significant export market.  There is a &euro;30 billion export market sitting in Europe, which we are not taking seriously.  Whether it is a result of remnants from the past, we should not be competing for the same space, we should be looking for different markets  That can be gained from having a coherent strategy on the approach to marketing organic produce.<\/p> <p>  We do not target the scheme.  I appreciate there may be criteria restrictions with which I am not as familiar as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I will leave that question for it.  Ideally, organic production should be market led, because if one opens the doors and lets everybody into the scheme, it basically pushes down prices elsewhere.  Some processors might think that is a good idea but I think that is part of Deputy Fitzmaurice's point on the reason that farming are bringing their produce to the commercial mart, because they are not getting in to supply their beef.  There is a limited number of processors, but in order for organic produce to be really successful - I am referring to countries that can demonstrate this - it is a multi-layered product.  If one has all of one product, one does not tend to be as successful as somebody with many different commodities, such as livestock, dairy, cheese production, added value, beers.  In such instances the whole sector lifts as opposed to having 90% in one sector.  That also echoes a point made by Deputy Fitzmaurice.<\/p><p>The double-funding issue with GLAS is something we have asked about tirelessly.  We agree completely on that.  Clarification may be needed as to what actually constitutes and defines double funding as we were under the impression, and measure 11 of the rural development programme makes it perfectly clear, that the organic farmer is being paid to produce food for the organic food supply whereas GLAS is an environmental scheme.  It is in response to the public demand for organic produce that the organic farming scheme was given a separate measure and supported as such.  We agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice that it is not double funding and we agree that there has been quite a barrier as such for certain people.  Having much of one product in there raises the question of what is actually being supported if this is not market led.  Is it that one is just going to give it to people where there is no market?  The counter argument to that is that one is paying people to be environmentally-friendly in their farming systems.  However, the scheme is market led because it has to go through a value reporting process.  As it is queried and audited as to its significant value and the returns to the Exchequer, it is market led.  Perhaps we need to be clearer about the market.  If we cannot be clearer about targeting it, we certainly need to support it with a full marketing scheme.<\/p><p> The front-loading aspect is again a question for the Department.  As far as I am aware, and we have looked into it, it is not actually allowed.  I do not think it is possible to front-load a per hectare payment, however I am not clear on it.  We looked at it only briefly.  Certainly, it is a question for the Department.<\/p><p> There are more processes coming online.  Many of them represent a kind of chicken-and-egg situation.  Farmers do not want to come on board with more product because they do not have the continuity of supply.  They are concerned about coming on board with more product lines if that continuity is not there.  Again, that is something the focus group on organic production, which is due to be opened quite soon, needs to sit down and think about.  It is a huge market in the EU and there is a great deal of opportunity which we cannot help but feel we are missing out on to a great extent.  It is a shame.  My colleagues will address some of the other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Gillian Westbrook","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507046400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin Kenny asked about the problem of getting people into the sector.  As Ms Westbrook outlined, one issue is the support system.  With no tranche of the organic farming scheme, OFS, open, farmers simply cannot make the commitment because it is a huge change.  The Deputy addressed the issue of husbandry, which Ms Lynch or Mr. Mooney will elaborate on.  It is certainly a different system of production and it involves much change, including a change of mindset, for farmers to convert to organic tillage.  It is not the same model as the conventional sector because one cannot put all of one's land in.  One has to build fertility on some parts of the land while producing crops on the balance.  It is quite difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Grace Maher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507046400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I will elaborate on the barriers for tillage farmers coming into organic tillage.  As an adviser, the biggest issue I note is that conventional tillage has become very high-input, which means that for a farmer to change to a system with very low inputs is a major step, even simply of mindset.  On foot of the way the tillage sector has developed in Ireland, we are talking about many farms which are 100% tillage.  For them to convert to organic requires putting a fertility building phase into their systems.  As part of the previous OFS, there was a double payment during that period, which definitely helped many farmers to get through two-year conversion time when they could produce cereals on only 50% of their land.  The &euro;220 per hectacre payment was not enough to compensate them for doing that.<\/p> <p>  There are many technical issues also.  If they have been 100% tillage, they do not have any fencing or water.  This is a challenge if they switch to having livestock grazing, even if it is another farmer's livestock where they can co-operate with other organic producers.  The fertility building phase usually involves a grass-clover mix.  If one had a mixed farm, one would let one's cattle out to graze it.  We need farmers to co-operate with other organic farmers who could use that part of the rotation to provide an economic return.  Currently, there is no economic return from perhaps half of one's farm.  If the &euro;220 per hectacre conversion payment is not enough to compensate one, one is not going to convert.<\/p><p>There is a whole psychological aspect to moving from a high chemical input system to the belief that a system with no chemical inputs will work.  For many farmers, that is very difficult.  The best way to get over that is to bring farmers to organic farms and show them that the crops grow, they are good and that yields are achieved.  That really helps but we have probably not had enough of it.<\/p><p> In many cases, the reality is that by having a small scheme which closed quickly, the Department did not show confidence in the system.  If the Department is not willing to fund the farmers coming in, that is very hard.  It appears to be saying the long-term future of the sector does not look good.  Having a system where the target is so low that it is all used up in year one does not provide any confidence to the sector that there will be funding for tillage into the future.  That said, I have received many more calls in the last 12 months from conventional tillage farmers who are looking at going organic.  Some of them have actually made the jump already even without having an organic farming scheme in the hope that it will come.  They can see that what they are doing has no long-term future as they are losing money.  If they can at least make sure they do not lose money, they will be better off.  If they can go back to a system with very low inputs and if any yield is at all profitable, it is better in some cases than what they have been doing.  We need to get much information out there, however, to convince conventional tillage farmers that organic is a viable option.  They need to see more successful organic tillage farmers to give them the confidence to make the change also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#EE00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507046400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I agree with Ms Lynch.  The conventional tillage sector in Ireland has become very specialised, the acreage has got very big and farmers are leasing land.  Without a shadow of a doubt, all that is compounding the difficulties of getting into organic production.  There is also the fact, to which Ms Lynch alluded, of the loss of infrastructure on those farms, including sheds to house cattle, roadways, water systems and fencing.  Even stockmanship skills are disappearing fast on the conventional tillage side.  The farmer is a machinery man, basically.  That is his pride and joy.  He is good at it and at maintaining machines.  That is the biggest stumbling block.  There is also the fact that it requires a great leap of faith to change from conventional to organic production.  A farmer will say, \"I am going out five, six or eight times with my sprayer or my fertiliser spreader and I will have nothing if I do not\".  It is not that he is not interested, but it is a huge jump for him to get his mindset back to more traditional rotational systems.

On the price question and, as I said earlier, we are very proud supporters and purchasers of Irish grain.  However, we are only 10% of the national grain output.  Even within our sector, there is only a limited amount.  As such, the 90% focus and problem is still going to be there.  For example, we are sourcing almost 100% of malted barley in Ireland which is because there has been innovation in the sector.  We have seen over a period of time that we have successfully displaced imported product.  By looking at innovation, we can certainly go down that route.<\/p><p>Irish Distillers is experimenting with rye blends on more than 140 acres in Enniscorthy.  It planted the rye in the autumn of 2016 with the intention of harvesting it in the late summer of 2017 for use in the distilling process.  More opportunities will arise from that pilot if it is successful.<\/p><p> The Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland is a trade organisation.  Under competition law, if I got involved in price fixing, I would find myself in jail.  There is absolutely no role for us in price negotiations.  Indeed, the brewers and distillers do not buy directly.  They buy through the malting companies.  This is a matter for them to deal with.  Unfortunately, we cannot get involved in that.<\/p><p> I would like to go back to the issue of Irish whiskey as a protected product.  Under a technical file on geographical indications that the Government has agreed with the EU, the drink must be distilled and matured in a very precise and technical way on the island of Ireland.  That is great because it means that this industry, unlike other industries, will never be moved offshore.  It has to happen here.  As an organisation, we have a role in protecting that internationally.  We pursue fraudulent products in other markets as an important part of our remit.  Under the geographical indications file I have mentioned, it is not necessary to source raw materials from Ireland.  There are two reasons for that.  First, many of the raw materials are not available here and will never be available here.  Second and more important, such a requirement would be in breach of the EU treaties.  It would be viewed as protectionist under Articles 107, 108 and 110 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union because it would hamper the freedom of movement of goods and would protect domestic producers, both of which are outlawed.  That is why such a requirement cannot be in place.<\/p><p> We are absolutely committed to increasing our use of Irish producers.  The industry has been keen to have this conversation in previous dialogues, including the Department's tillage forum, as part of the effort to extend the innovation agenda to a broader range of products.  Approximately 60% of raw material inputs in this sector come from the island of Ireland.  This is very high in comparison with other sectors, including some that are more lauded.  I will come back to the committee with more detail in this regard.  I emphasise that many other raw materials in addition to grain are used in the process of making whiskey and beer.<\/p><p> I would like to mention Bord Bia's Origin Green initiative in the context of the five-year to ten-year plan.  We are increasingly calling on our members to be part of all the great work that Bord Bia is doing with marketplace initiatives and buyers.  One of the criteria now being implemented is that producers have to be in Origin Green, a key part of which involves doing between 90% and 100% of sourcing at local level.  I think that plan is actually in place.  We are certainly working towards that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#FF00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>No one here is asking the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland to engage in price fixing.

I appreciate that some people have argued that GLAS is a very good scheme because they can get priority access into it.  However, certain aspects of it, such as the premium payments, mean that the organic farmer will be better off in GLAS.  The organic farming sector comprises hundreds of thousands of small farmers.  It is important that organic farmers are not omitted from environmental schemes.  I know many small farmers are very insulted by the fact that even though they are farming in an environmentally friendly way to produce food for an organic food chain, they cannot get involved in an environmental scheme.  I would have to agree with them.  The Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association made a submission under the GLAS programme saying that these were additional measures that would not attract double funding.  We called it GLAS+.  I do not know if that was a mistake.  If so, I apologise.  It is not easy to come up with measures that would not attract double funding.  We agree that this is a major barrier.

There has been a welcome increase in the amount of barley and malted barley that is being sourced locally.<\/p><p>The percentage of barley and malted barley we in the whiskey industry source in Ireland is in the high 90s.  This compares favourably with Scotland, where the latest figures from the Scotch Whiskey Association show that the percentage of their barley that is sourced domestically is only in the 80s.  It is an issue of supply.  As for other grains, we know there is a demand and a need for maize in the development of grain whiskey, which is one of the forms of whiskey which is in turn an important part of blended whiskeys.  Some of the major whiskey brands in Ireland are blended.  Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the supply of appropriate grain in Ireland.  This is why we are seeing maize being imported but, again, we are no different from Scotland in this regard.  In fact, the percentage of wheat used in scotch whisky production that Scotland imports is very high - about 50% - so we are probably doing better than Scotland in domestic sourcing.  The example my colleague gave of the Irish distillers developing new rye strains in Wexford, which they are innovating and trying to develop as a sustainable new source, should mean that reliance on imported grains other than barley will decrease over time, particularly in line with the commitments that members have made under Origin Green.<\/p><p> Finally, I know there has been debate earlier and at previous hearings as to whether there should be some sort of regulation or requirement that Irish produce such as Irish whiskey comprise 100% locally sourced raw materials.  This would be a very serious constraint on production.  The Irish whiskey renaissance would die a death because we would not be able to develop the capacity as we would not be able to import the maize.  It would also put us at a severe competitive disadvantage against Scotland, particularly at a time of Brexit.  At a time when Irish whiskey is the fastest-growing spirits category in the world, it would set us back substantially.  We are committed to using as near as possible to 100% Irish barley.  We are increasing the percentage of other grain we are using domestically, and I think over coming years the increased demand, coupled with the commitments for increased sourcing under Origin Green, will mean a significant return for Irish farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017100300002#HH01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Lavelle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I know the Scottish whiskey sector is an awful lot bigger than the Irish whiskey sector.

My name is Pat Kiely and I am the managing director of TV3.  I am joined by Aine Ni Chaoindealbhain, director of operations, and Bill Malone, director of programming.  I am also joined by some of my colleagues from across the organisation, some of whom will be referenced in my submission.<\/p> <p>  I want to start with a background to the TV3 story.  I will also cover the challenges faced by broadcasters across the board in a rapidly changing media world, the dire need for more local efficiencies in this sector and the great potential for a thriving television industry in Ireland.  Most importantly, our submission today outlines our belief that the future of public service broadcasting is best served by improving efficiencies in the current model and creating an environment that encourages investment.  There is a way to secure a bright future for RTE and the wider broadcasting sector but increasing RTE's funding is not the way.<\/p> <p>  To begin, let me talk about TV3, Ireland's commercial public service broadcaster.  As I have been with the business from start-up in 1998, I am probably best placed to tell the TV3 story.  The TV3 story is an important one as within it, we believe, lie lessons which could help inform future broadcasting policy.  Over the past 19 years, TV3 has developed an extraordinary ability not only to survive, but to thrive in a more challenging market.  Having been written off many times, TV3's resilience is a credit to a hard working, fast moving and efficiently run business.  TV3 Group now operates three linear free-to-air channels - TV3, 3e, and Be3 - and a digital platform, 3Player.  We employ over 300 staff and this year will spend over &euro;60 million, making a marginal profit for the second year in a row, unique among other television broadcasters in Ireland.  Like all of our media colleagues, it was a battle for survival through the recession but we cut our cloth, continued to honour our licence commitments, maintained viewership and retained advertising support.<\/p> <p>  The acquisition of TV3 by Virgin Media in late 2015 ultimately ensured the survival of the group, and Virgin Media's subsequent acquisition of UTV Ireland in 2016 rescued that licence and saved jobs.  This new broadcasting group has provided TV3 with a new lease of life and with more economic certainty.  This is a topic I am sure will be covered by Tony Hanway, Virgin Media Ireland CEO, when he speaks to the committee later.<\/p> <p>  TV3's more recent performance, as will have been noted by the committee, has been driven through a growing emphasis on home-produced programming, with more than 50% of the channel's schedule now produced in Ireland.  This is double our public service licence requirement of 25% and matches RTE's percentage of home-produced programming, an impressive if unreported fact.  Virgin Media and parent Liberty Global have backed this strategy of investment in Irish content and are backing Ireland.  They have put their money where their mouth is and, despite market uncertainty, Virgin Media has invested over &euro;5 million in capital expenditure since acquisition to upgrade our studios and infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  In an increasingly competitive media landscape, I am hugely excited about the growing momentum around our channels and the future potential to build on this as part of Virgin Media.  As long as our investors can see that Ireland is a place to do business, I am confident this relationship will drive the sector overall.  However, artificially propping up the inefficiencies of the current funding model will scare off all potential inward investment.  As part of our Irish content strategy, TV3 has made huge progress in recent years in acting as a counterweight to the dominance of RTE and has become a more significant player in news and current affairs.  Without TV3, viewers would be reliant on State-funded television news, which is not ideal for a functioning democracy and a blow to plurality.<\/p> <p>  We recently launched the 3News Ireland hub, led by our head of news, Mick McCaffrey, who is with us today.  3News is now Ireland's most technologically advanced news studio.  TV3 Group's main news bulletins at 12.30 p.m., 5.30 p.m., 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. are offering independent news options while competing impressively against the State broadcaster, both in terms of audience and hours of output.  We are also developing new-to-television talent, including TV3's new political correspondent, Gavan Reilly, who, as always, is also onsite today.  When we add in TV3 providing Ireland's only breakfast news, seven days a week, and our significantly growing current affairs output, I believe we have well and truly earned our stripes as a credible alternative voice.<\/p> <p>  This is how a properly functioning broadcasting environment should work.  RTE should not be given more funding to, in effect, ensure its ongoing dominance over commercial competition.  TV3's challenge is to complement this key content of news and current affairs with entertainment, documentaries, drama and sport, the staples of a mainstream free-to-air broadcaster.  A key point is that our focus in these areas is to provide Irish viewers with unique moments that only an Irish broadcaster can provide.  \"Red Rock\" and our new drama \"Darklands\" are great examples, as is our \"True Lives\" documentary strand, \"Gogglebox Ireland\" and even Al Porter's \"Blind Date\".  Early next year, viewers will see TV3 become the home of the Six Nations and \"Ireland's Got Talent\".  Here is the twist - we will do all of this by increasing investment and profitability.  It can be done.<\/p> <p>  As an almost wholly ad-funded broadcaster, the mix of content is essential for us to appeal to demanding advertisers whose choices are becoming increasingly more global.  Google and Facebook took 80% of all the advertising growth in the digital sector in 2016.  Netflix and Amazon Prime are now challenging traditional viewing habits.  Reassuringly, traditional television is holding its own, and total viewing is down just two minutes in the past ten years.  We have done this in Ireland thanks to the great programming being produced by RTE, TV3 and TG4.  However, if Irish media is going to continue to compete, we have to be much more open to collaborations and partnerships.  Over the past year, Virgin Media has entered into partnerships with Netflix on its television platform and we have entered into a partnership with Sky on advanced advertising.  These partnerships will keep us ahead of the curve and relevant to demanding viewers and advertisers.<\/p> <p>  We would love to extend this partnership philosophy to the television sector in Ireland where the combined strengths and talents of RTE and TV3 could be used to drive efficiencies.  Examples of this could be collaboration on production and a shared diaspora channel for Irish communities all over the globe.  A more collaborative approach would create long-term sustainability for Irish broadcasting through creativity and innovation.<\/p><p>I have raised these opportunities with RTE directly and hope that we could collectively drive new revenue through these ventures.  There are also opportunities to work more closely on rights.  Arch rivals BBC and ITV lead by example here, where the State and commercial broadcasters have shared rights and studio facilities to save money and to best serve UK viewers.  The broadcasting sector faces significant challenges and external pressures, not least Brexit.  As TV3 is almost wholly reliant on advertising revenue, Brexit has twice the impact on our business than on that of RTE, where advertising is less than half of their total revenue.  TV3 recognises the unique role and function RTE has in a democratic society.  Ireland needs a strong indigenous broadcasting sector and RTE has a major role to play in this regard, together with TV3 and TG4.  Nevertheless, could RTE get more out of its substantial budget and could it control its costs more efficiently?  Through a TV3 lens, the answer is a very firm \"Yes\" but perhaps that is too easy a prognosis.  I have sympathy with RTE being asked to both fulfil its public service remit and maximise commercial revenues.  This is the ultimate conflict of interest and results in the issues and structural failure we now see.  There is a simple answer, however, which is at the core of TV3's ability to run a profitable business, and that is to cut one's cloth to suit one's measure.  TV3 is constrained by a much more limited budget and cannot spend more than it generates in revenue.  Fiscal discipline is non-negotiable at TV3.  The reality is that RTE continues to have it both ways, enjoying the bulk of the licence fee, as well as close to 50% of the advertising spend.  In 2016, the licence fee subsidy alone was almost &euro;180 million.  This is the jump start that RTE has over TV3 every year.<\/p><p> RTE has now requested an increase in funding from the State, as well as other charges, but when I look at RTE's share of the market both in terms of viewers and advertising, it enjoys a more dominant position than any other State broadcaster I can find.  In 2016, for example, the year RTE reported a &euro;19.7 million deficit, it proudly boasted that it had 20 of the top 20 programmes on Irish television in that year.  In the UK, 13 of the top 20 shows come from the State broadcaster BBC, with the other seven coming from the commercial broadcaster ITV, demonstrating a much greater equilibrium in our closest neighbour.<\/p><p> If I were RTE, I would highlight that this is a sign of a great job.  Indeed within this list were some spectacular examples of public service programming we should all admire.  At the same time, however, RTE knew it was running a deficit and could have offloaded some of these programmes, particularly those that more fulfil their commercial rather than their public service agenda.  Indeed, six of these top 20 programmes were Euro 2016 matches, which TV3 offered to buy as part of a sublicensing deal.  My point is that last year there were solutions out there for RTE to share the financial burden of content demands.  As history has shown, however, when RTE runs up deficits it typically secures relief from Government.  Again, if I were RTE, I would not be inclined to reduce spend if I felt I was always going to get a bailout.  This all goes back to the &ldquo;cutting one's cloth&rdquo; principle.  Last year when TV3 saw a drop in advertising revenue, we took corrective action straight away, including running fewer episodes of big shows like \"Red Rock\".  By being light on our feet, however, we maintained our number two position in the market, kept advertisers on side and turned a profit.  I honestly think RTE could have delivered the same result.  <\/p><p> In summary, an increase in funding for RTE would be detrimental to the sector and most likely would damage other media, including local radio and Irish newspapers.  It is surely time for RTE to focus on its core objective, which is to provide quality public service broadcasting.  There is a lack of clear definition, however, as to what constitutes a public service.  Is it providing dozens of different services?  Are they all really necessary?  Do they provide value for money?  This lack of clear definition and purpose must frustrate RTE as much as it does TV3.  Rather than continuing RTE's open-ended commercial remit, let us make sure that all RTE commercial activities are appropriate and cost-effective.  Industry competition is always vital and the TV3 story is a great testament to how competition makes you stronger.  RTE has been artificially insulated from this competitive tension and to exacerbate this situation by increasing its licence fee funding or introducing new charges would serve nobody, least of all RTE.  With six deficits in seven years, it is no longer appropriate for the State broadcaster to be given a blank cheque when it comes to competing against the commercial sector.  Indeed, the commercial sector should be recognised for its contribution to public service broadcasting in Ireland.<\/p><p> I hope I have given members some food for thought in the context of the TV3 story.  In turn, I ask this joint committee to reassess TV3's contribution to public service broadcasting and revisit RTE's purpose.  By doing so, we can find a remedy that does not draw on the public purse or the already hard-pressed taxpayer.  Instead let us re-imagine Ireland as world-class player operating on the global content stage, creating inward investment, jobs and a whole new export pipeline.  TV3 really looks forward to playing our part in this ongoing dialogue but in the meantime I am happy to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Kiely","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I will start with a question of my own, followed by one each from Deputy Dooley and one further member.

He signalled a strong recognition of the importance of public service broadcasting, which I share, namely, the importance of protecting our local news and current affairs output, in which TV3 very much participates, as well as the importance of the preservation and protection of our culture, language, music and indigenous production sector.  This is all very important.  I might correct Mr. Kiely on the distinction between a public service broadcaster and a State broadcaster.  I see RTE as a public service broadcaster but certainly not as a State broadcaster.  It does not necessarily represent the Government; it certainly did not do so when my party was in government and I am sure members from the other parties would say the same.  Mr Kiely's presentation was good in setting out a framework but I probably counted as many references to RTE in it as I did to TV3.  While he has told us what we should not do for RTE, he has not really told us what we should be doing for TV3.  Perhaps Mr. Kiely believes that keeping RTE at a level of control would allow TV3 to flourish.  He might enlighten us on that.<\/p> <p>  TV3 plays a very significant role in adding to the preservation and protection of our culture, language, music, and current affairs and news output.  I would be interested to hear if there is anything more that we can do to protect that.  There was a time when the debate was a matter of TV3 versus RTE.  I do not see this any more and nor do I see it as a matter of TV3 and RTE versus Sky or Virgin.  What I see is all of these broadcasters versus Google and Facebook and that poses a very significant threat to the indigenous content in respect of news, current affairs, culture, music and so on.  I consider that to be under enormous threat and I would prefer to see TV3 and RTE more closely aligned in recognising that threat, as opposed to necessarily taking pops at each other.  If RTE were in here with us they would probably say much the same against TV3 as Mr. Kiely has said against them.  I do not think that this helps the debate when it comes to what members are trying to do, which is to deal with what I perceive as a threat to our local sector from Google, Facebook and others.  From Mr. Kiely's perspective, is there anything this committee can do to assist TV3 in continuing to flourish?  He indicated that the emergence of Virgin as a partner and operator has been very positive in setting TV3 on a firm path.  Mr. Kiely rightly identified the station's role here in Leinster House and what it has done for current affairs broadcasting.  Many of us who have had to encounter Vincent Browne will see his retirement from TV3 as a very significant loss - one might not have done as one was leaving the studio - in terms of his contribution to democracy in Ireland with that particular programme.  The role undertaken by TV3 with its programming in the last election put RTE under pressure, particularly with regard to how it reached regions and communities.  It did a really good job.<\/p><p>TV3 has had a very positive role and I recognise that.  Maybe the situation has changed since Mr. David McRedmond was at TV3, and I believe Mr. Kiely was around in those days also.  Mr. McRedmond had a particular view about retransmission fees and I think he was in favour of the capacity to negotiate at the time.  Has TV3's view on that changed with the emergence of Virgin Media, or should I direct that question to Virgin Media representatives when we see them later?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#C00300","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputy Stanley before I go back to the witnesses from TV3.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#D00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kiely for his presentation.  It was informative but I read in it that he did lean heavily on RTE.  Some of the points he made are very valid.<\/p> <p>  I have a concern around not having a public sector broadcaster operating in the media landscape.  TV3 has provided a good service and as well as being a viewer I have been on some of the \"Tonight with Vincent Browne\" shows.  I found it in the main to be very fair.  My concern is around a solely corporate sector in this arena and the influence it would have.  I will give an example of the newspaper media.  I am not arguing for a State newspaper or a publicly funded newspaper but newspapers are solely commercial.  Four years ago I raised an issue in the D&aacute;il Chamber during a debate with a Minister.  The next day one of the newspapers, which could be counted as one of the more credible newspapers, carried a story on the debate.  The newspaper printed a substantial article that noted the fact that the issue had been raised and what had transpired in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  While Deputies are not in the Chamber all the time, the article quoted a Fianna F&aacute;il source who was not in the Chamber for the debate.  It quoted a Green Party person who was not elected to the D&aacute;il or to the Seanad but there was no mention of a Sinn F&eacute;in representative.  I met the journalist a day or two later and I explained that while I was happy to see the issue being covered - obviously that is important - the article had quoted two parties who had not been in the Chamber and had not mentioned the party that had brought the topic forward.  I asked what had happened.  The journalist told me that it must have hit the editor's floor.  That newspaper, which is the one I buy the most, would pride itself on being a newspaper of record, I am told.<\/p> <p>  I have searched through the daily newspapers and one can find a political thread running through them and a particular political lean and slant in them.  I am concerned that we would wind up with a broadcasting industry the same.  TV3 has produced good programmes.  Some people may have found Vincent Browne combative and quite argumentative but he certainly opened up much debate in Ireland about important issues.  This is a concern of many Deputies and much of the public.<\/p> <p>  I have my criticisms of RTE.  I heard some serious criticisms of RTE here last Wednesday, especially around the content of some of its weekend programmes and the issue of the usual suspects being on air every week.  In the context of protecting the public interest, how does Mr. Kiely see this panning out?  Throughout my lifetime I have not found any place where he who pays the piper does not call the tune to some extent.  I am not saying that advertisers would stand over the broadcasters' shoulder breathing down their necks or holding the editor's pen.  Inevitably, if a broadcaster or publication is solely dependent on major advertisers it presents the advertisers with significant power.  It has the potential to put the station, or any station solely dependent on that revenue, in to a compromising situation where balanced content may not be the main issue or it may not come through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#D00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Vincent Browne's contribution to TV3 has been extraordinary and really gave us the foundation that we are now building on.  In many ways, he will still be part of it.  As the committee is probably aware, he is working on a documentary series for us.  I will bring to the members' attention one of his closing statements on his last show.  In crediting and thanking the quite considerable number of people who helped to make that show what it was, he acknowledged that in the ten years he worked on the show the TV3 management never interfered editorially.  I would let Vincent Browne be the testimonial to TV3's reputation editorially.<\/p> <p>  I will speak about the partnership with Virgin Media and how it has helped.  I reiterate what I have already said in my statement.  Virgin Media saved TV3 from obscurity.  We were holding on through the recession and the investment that Virgin Media has put into the business says it all.  I will come back to that point later.<\/p> <p>  With regard to what TV3 has been doing around news and current affairs, our coverage is truly independent.  It is an extraordinary testament to the talent within TV3.  Previously, TV3 news and current affairs talent ended up in Donnybrook.  Members would know this.  Much of the talent would work its way through only to be taken away.  We have changed that and we have become a great ground for new talent in front of and behind the cameras.

The strategy now is to invest in Irish home-produced content.  Today there will be nine and a half hours of home-produced content on TV3.

Now we have a real opportunity, particularly with Virgin Media as owners of TV3.  Virgin Media can open up 4 million homes in the UK overnight through its network in the UK and there is a great opportunity.  Previous manifestations were, as is previous on this topic, RTE-focused.

We had to ask to be included in a number of debates over the past number of years.  We are not viewed as a public service broadcaster and therefore we ourselves have to ask.  I believe we need to earn the right to be at that table but what I presented today is, hopefully, evidence that we are putting our money where our mouth is.

Will the witnesses elaborate to the committee on the effect of Sky being able to use Irish advertising in the context of non-Irish channels, some of which, as far as I can see, have nothing to do with Ireland, although they are very enjoyable.  In saying that  I am not casting aspersions.  That capacity must have some significant effect on the available revenue pool from Ireland.  Could the witnesses say something about what the competitive rates for advertising, as between, say, themselves and Sky and themselves and RTE and TG4, would be because it seems if is to be the alternate source to public funding we should be conscious that there is a leak in the bucket going to broadcasters with no public service obligations of any kind and no licence obligations of any significance in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Mention was made in Mr. Kiely's presentation of the possibility of RTE getting more.  The Chairman was unavoidably absent, but I understood that when the Minister addressed us on the last occasion he made it clear that as far as he was concerned, there would be no increase in the licence fee for RTE.<\/p> <p>  Listening, as one must do, to RTE radio a lot, I am struck by the advertising slots, almost 50% of which seem to be State, semi-State or governmental agencies advertising.  Whether it is the Road Safety Authority, the vaccination programmes and so on, the amount of State or quasi-State advertising is significant on RTE radio.  Does TV3 believe it is getting its fair share of Government advertising or semi-State advertising?  Is there a special rate for Government advertising?  Is there some commercial underpinning to where a vaccination programme advertises, whether it goes to TV3 or somebody else?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#E00700","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I thank the TV3 representatives for the informative contribution that they have made to today's meeting.  I admire the success of TV3.  I would compare TV3 to any business.  Every business in the past eight to ten years has struggled and it is a credit to TV3 that it has managed to survived in a difficult market.  Since the investment of Virgin Media, it is clear that there is an improvement in the content, range and quality of programming on TV3.  It is nice to see that progression.  In particular, I can see an improvement in the presentation of TV3's programme.  I suppose that comes from the philosophy of paying for what one can afford.  Clearly TV3 would not be able to compete in the marketplace, in terms of professionals and personnel, unless they were being adequately recompensed.<\/p> <p>  I always had a difficulty with RTE in terms of public service.  Some people think that they have a job for life and should have a life, and all that one gets when one reprogrammes is a change in the deck chairs.  There have been constraints on TV3 because of the commercial nature of the business and because it must work to survive and there is no lifeboat if it is not economically viable.  All I would suggest is that in its recent presentations, TV3 should allow a bit of slack in the wardrobe allowance because I was looking at Ivan Yates recently and I have to say he needs some assistance in that area.<\/p> <p>  Could Mr. Kiely be more specific in what he means when he asked the committee to reassess TV3's contribution to public service broadcasting?

In coverage of the regions, in particular, Cork, or even Munster, does TV3 find it hard to compete?  Is the TV3 platform, to have one main reporter based in the south, becoming an issue in getting the spread required to increase viewership?

We are very clear on our position that any new charge should not be directed at RTE to recover in respect of an inefficiency.  That is a starting point.  With regard to the transmission fee as a broader issue, we are clear on our position that it would be another form of taxation.  It is most likely that all the platforms would pass it on and that it would become another cost to the consumer.  From TV3's point of view as a broadcaster, considering that we are an independent business and make our own independent decisions, there is no doubt that, in seeking the investment I seek from the group, it would be absolutely impacted upon if transmission fees were to be passed on to the platform.  We have already declared the investment that Virgin Media is putting into TV3.

It is being impacted on two fronts.  The first is the lack of confidence.  The advertising market is down in the United Kingdom, meaning investment is much more short term.  The second concerns the foreign exchange.  The sterling investments are showing up in Ireland.  They are 15% to 20% lower than they would have been prior to the hit.<\/p> <p>  On advertising pricing, Deputy Lowry asked who polices advertising decision-making.  In effect, it is self-policed because the advertisers go for value.  It is typically managed by advertising agencies.  Therein lies one of our issues with RTE's ability to dominate through State funding and then play in the advertising market.  I have referred to RTE having 20 of the top 20 shows.  The impact of that on the advertising market is that RTE has an ability to charge between 30% and 40% more than TV3, not because of poor salesmanship - some of the staff who do that job are present - and not because RTE is better at selling airtime but because it has 20 of the top 20 shows.  How advertisers buy advertising across a range of broadcasters is actually quite scientific and sophisticated.  The options have opened up.  I was previously the commercial director and advertising sales was one of my responsibilities.  Therefore, I can talk about it.  When TV3 was launched, it was one of four channels that could offer Irish companies advertising on television.  Now there are over 50.  Senator McDowell should note that many have come through Sky's \"opt-outs\", as we call them.  In many ways, Sky's opening up of the opt-out channels helped to grow the market.  It goes back to the point I made about competition.  We are not afraid of competition.  We support a free market but it does get affected.  I was asked specifically about pricing.  RTE's prices are 30% to 40% more than those of TV3.  Sky's pricing, because it has quite low-rating programming, is lower than that of TV3.  That is the hierarchy but it is artificially affected by RTE's ability to command the top content.<\/p> <p>  On the question on regions, we would like to have more regional offices.  There is no doubt about that.  Under Virgin Media we opened up our mid-west office with Eric Clarke.  We have Paul Byrne in Cork and Eric Clarke in Limerick, covering the mid-west.  Ms &Aacute;ine N&iacute; Chaoindealbh&aacute;in oversaw the expansion of the offices in Cork and Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Kiely"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507046400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Again, the link with Virgin Media came into play for the Limerick viewer because we were able to utilise the existing site.

Let us be honest: they have very big viewerships in Ireland.  They are well-established programmes, as one knows, and they are quite enjoyable.<\/p> <p>  TV3 does not seem to have any Oireachtas report.  It does not have any slot for this, even late at night at 11.30 p.m. or 12 midnight.  It does not show coverage of the D&aacute;il, Seanad and committees.  I do not see any reason it could not do so.  RTE does show coverage but it does not have a monopoly on controlling the output from these Houses.  It would be very worthwhile, in a democracy and in very challenging times, if TV3 could fit in coverage somewhere, even if only once per week.  It could do a round-up of the events in the D&aacute;il, Seanad and committees.  It would be of interest to some of TV3's viewers and result in some competition.  There is no competition with \"Oireachtas Report\" on RTE.  It is hit and miss as to who gets on that programme.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Senator Lombard on regional input and I accept it is expensive.  There is no regional input from the west.  There is nobody covering anything down there.  I regard TV3 as a Dublin-oriented station.  It should and could consider utilising the excellent broadcasters in local radio through Skype and all the modern technology.  One could slot them in without any real costs.  Those concerned are all linked to the Internet.  There would be some costs involved but there are some terrific broadcasters in every county who could have a great input.  Could TV3 examine that as a possibility for a programme called \"Regional Round-up\" or some such title?  \"Nationwide\", presented by Mary Kennedy, is an excellent programme.  It is a programme of record for the future.  What it is filming now in rural areas will be of archival interest in 100 years.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses will recall the company called Irish TV.  It is gone, unfortunately.  It tried very hard to become a regional, rural station.  Could TV3 investigate whether it could secure its footage and records?

Film footage is so valuable and very good for records.  TV3 should keep up its good work.  <\/p> <p>  My final question is for Mr. Pat Kiely in his capacity as a former advertising man.

There would be an understandable reluctance on the part of RTE to share rights if it felt it did not have to do that.  If RTE did not have the option of running up a deficit last year it would have had to sell more rights, such as the Euro 2016 example I gave.  We offered to take half or more of those rights but ended up doing a smaller deal.  We publically complimented RTE on the decision to sublicense those rights.  We thought it was the beginning, but unfortunately it was not a great experience in the end because the games RTE sub-licensed were typically the smaller, less popular games or games which were up against all-Ireland championships.  It was evidence of RTE's embarrassment of riches in terms of sport that it had such schedule clashes.  <\/p> <p>  Growing up I cannot remember a football tournament that was not shared straight down the middle between BBC and ITV.

On behalf of Sky I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to appear today as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2017.  I am managing director of Sky Ireland, a position I have held since 2012.  I am joined here today by Mr. David Wheeldon, Sky's group director of policy and public affairs.  Along with representatives from Eir, Virgin and Vodafone, we are also joined by Ms Tabitha Elwes and Jon Zeff of CIL Management who are both experts in this particular area.<br\/><br\/>I would like to start by outlining the important role that Sky plays in the Irish broadcasting sector and our strong commitment to the Irish market.  Sky has been offering television services in Ireland since 1990.  In 2013, we significantly expanded our presence in Ireland and announced a &euro;1 billion investment plan over five years which we are currently progressing in a number of ways.  These included sustained investment in customer service for our Irish customers, new products such as broadband as well as investment in content, marketing and corporate social responsibility initiatives.  We are the number one television platform in Ireland.  We are present in more than 40% of Irish homes, watched by over 2 million viewers and we deliver over 500 channels, including the Irish public service channels, to our customer base.  We also operate 26 wholly owned channels across general entertainment, news, sport and film.  We currently employ almost 1,000 people in Ireland and in our last financial year our contribution to the Exchequer in terms of corporation tax, VAT and employer PRSI was in excess of &euro;150 million.  During the same period, Sky&rsquo;s activities in Ireland supported a total contribution to GDP in excess of &euro;650 million. <br\/><br\/>Sky is also major investor in home grown programming across the UK and Ireland.  We recently announced a &euro;2 million fund for an original Irish entertainment production which will be commissioned for Sky One in this financial year.  This is a crucial step that will allow us to build on previous successful Irish commissions such as the Emmy award winners &quot;Moone Boy&quot; and &quot;50 Ways to Kill your Mammy&quot; as well as previous productions filmed here such as &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;MoonFleet&quot; and &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot;.  As many committee members will know, we have also just opened a new Sky News Dublin bureau.  This initiative will allow us to cover Irish news stories as they happen and in depth.  Both of these moves demonstrate our sustained commitment to content production in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In addition to all of this, we also collaborate closely with, and provide significant value to, Irish public service broadcasters, including RTE  We currently beam RTE&rsquo;s channels into over 40% of Irish homes and place them in the most prominent positions on our electronic programme guide, that is channel 101, 102 and so on.  This ensures that RTE&rsquo;s public service broadcasting reaches the widest possible audience, thereby helping it to achieve its public service objectives.<i><\/i>It also enables RTE to drive high viewing figures and earn significant advertising revenues in the process.  We estimate that around &euro;32 million of RTE&rsquo;s advertising income is derived from viewing on the Sky platform alone.  Beyond this, our current commercial agreement with RTE means we provide specific financial contributions and benefits in kind to RTE in return for certain services. <br\/><br\/>I hope this makes clear the significant contribution Sky makes, both to the Irish broadcasting sector and to the economy as a whole.  It also highlights the very real stake we have in policy decisions taken around public service broadcasting.  In that context, it is worth emphasising that we are very supportive of the Bill as drafted.  In particular, we are encouraged by the proposals aimed at tackling the difficulties associated with the current television licence system.  Licence fee evasion is estimated to reach &euro;40 million this year and it is clear that measures need to be taken to reduce this level of evasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. J.D. Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507046400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Buckley.  I am now going to address the issue at the heart of this session, namely retransmission fees.  RTE has argued that it should be permitted to drop its obligation - known as 'must offer' - to distribute its channels as widely as possible at no cost to consumers.  I would like to consider the obverse of that obligation.  What RTE is requesting is the right to restrict the availability of its publicly funded channels and to, in effect, charge consumers.  We are of the view that allowing RTE to do this would negatively affect all parties, including, most importantly, Irish citizens accessing programmes they have already paid for via a licence fee.  To be clear, we do not believe that 'must offer' can be tweaked, as RTE put it, without fundamentally altering its intent.  Either RTE has to make its channels available without payment or it has the ability to restrict availability, which can in no way be described as 'must offer'.  The reason 'must offer' exists is twofold.  Licence fee payers have a reasonable expectation to watch publicly funded channels on whatever platform they mainly chose to watch television and they also, quite reasonably, do not expect to be charged twice for it through both the licence fee and additional charges.<\/p> <p>  By way of background, Sky&rsquo;s business model is quite straightforward.  In all six of the European markets in which we operate we only charge customers for channels that we actually sell to them.  We only sell channels that cannot be obtained for free elsewhere and, it goes without saying, we do not pay for channels we do not sell.  Since we do not and cannot sell RTE channels to our customers we are not in a position to pay for them.  To be clear, Sky would not pay RTE for its public service channels should RTE no longer be obliged to provide them for free.  Of course, in such a scenario RTE might decide voluntarily to withdraw from the main television platform in over 40% of Irish homes, in which case there can only be losers.  If RTE removes its channels those Irish licence fee payers who use Sky to watch television would obviously be inconvenienced, as would Sky.  We make no pretence about that but we have means of mitigating the impact which I shall come to later.  The main loser will be RTE itself which stands to lose &euro;83 million in advertising revenue over five years, according to its own research.  RTE could, after a period, choose to return to our platform but I must make the committee aware that in its absence, there may well have been changes made to our programme guide and we may not be in a position to guarantee that RTE would return to its current position.  I do not say that as any kind of threat but commitments may have been made to other channels that we may not be able to undo.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned that we would seek to mitigate the impact on Sky&rsquo;s customers of RTE leaving the platform.  Fortunately we have some experience of this.  In Italy, which is one of our other major markets in Europe, we developed a free-to-air USB dongle which plugged into the Sky box and allowed customers to toggle between Sky and the Italian equivalent of Saorview when the public broadcaster Rai left our platform under what I would term political pressure, Italy being a market that is subject to quite a bit of that.  It is worth noting that Rai is now back on Sky&rsquo;s platform in Italy, without payment.  Sky&rsquo;s market share remained steady during the entire time Rai was off our platform.  Clearly, this is not our desired outcome as it will divert money away from productive and useful investment in our Irish business, which as Mr. Buckley said, we have an ambition to continue.  Nevertheless, it does demonstrate the mitigation measures available to us. <\/p> <p>  In the context of our multinational operations, it is worth saying that this matter has been looked at it in other jurisdictions.  In the UK, for example, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport carried out an extensive consultation on the issue, lasting two years, and concluded that the prevailing zero fees and 'must offer\/must carry' regime resulted in the best outcome for citizens.  That is still its policy.  It is also worth noting in this context that the BBC did not seek any change in the UK legislation as it did not wish to endanger the principle of universal availability of public service broadcasting services or call into question the legitimacy of a universal licence fee. <\/p> <p>  I would also like to briefly touch upon the situation in the US, which has been frequently cited by RTE and its advisors, Mediatique, as an example of a successful retransmission fees regime.  The truth is that the European and US markets are so different that comparisons are of little value.  Most importantly, the US does not have a universal licence fee.  Beyond that, the availability of any free-to-air terrestrial television is extremely limited.<\/p><p>Where it is available, it is often underpowered, meaning that signal and picture quality is poor, and far poorer than it is in the majority of Europe.  As a result, pay television has, at more than 80%, a higher market share than it does in most of Europe.  Pay television packages are the only way that most viewers can access local broadcasters.  Retransmission fees in this market are a different proposition.<\/p><p> It is worth taking note of the knock-on effect of the negotiations on retransmission fees in America.  There have been substantial increases in consumer prices, which are often broken out as a \"broadcast fee\" in customers' bills, and a large number of channel blackouts.  In 2015, almost 200 channels were made temporarily unavailable, with the longest dispute lasting more than six months.<\/p><p> The US example has led RTE down a blind alley.  It is evident from the Mediatique analysis that it has selectively failed to recognise the differences between the US and European markets, in particular the widespread availability of public broadcasters in every home free to air in Europe.  This has led RTE to assume incorrectly that pay television platforms would suffer disproportionately if PSB channels came off them and ceased to be available.  In fact, these broadcasters would still be available through other means.  RTE has got its sums wrong.<\/p><p> Universal availability, free of additional charges beyond the licence fee, is widely recognised as a key tenet of any public service broadcasting regime.  Such obligations go hand in hand with the benefits that PSBs receive.  If RTE is asking to remove the obligations that it faces, it stands to reason that the significant benefits it receives should no longer be made available to it.  Should the committee and Government wish to consider such a deregulated approach and remove not just the restrictions that RTE feels are imposed on it, but also withdraw all of the benefits, including the universal licence fee and other forms of State funding, we would be happy to enter into commercial negotiations with it in the same way that we do with any other commercial channel that seeks access to our platform and wishes to be retailed.  However, it is unlikely that RTE would favour such an approach in the absence of such two-sided deregulation.  Therefore, and sitting where we are, it appears that RTE wishes to have its cake and eat it as well.<\/p><p> We do not pay for PSBs to be available on our satellite platform in any of our European markets.  This is a crucial and consistent premise of Sky's operating model.  Regardless of any legislative change or the value that RTE does or does not deliver to our platform, there are no circumstances in which we would change our approach and begin to make payments for a free-to-air channel in any of our markets simply because of the precedent that it would set for us elsewhere.  Put frankly, this issue has far wider ramifications for us than our Irish business and we would be incentivised to stick to the line here to avoid risks elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Wheeldon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Buckley wish to speak again briefly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#K00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507046400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Yes.

To support Virgin Media's contribution today, I am accompanied by Ms Kate O'Sullivan, vice-president of corporate affairs at Virgin Media Ireland.<\/p> <p>  By way of introduction, Virgin Media is part of the Liberty Global family, which is the world's largest international TV and broadband company.  We employ over 1,800 people in Ireland and offer 1 million services to more than 500,000 Irish customers.  We have invested more than &euro;1 billion in building Ireland's fastest connected entertainment network, which means that we are now home to the fastest, most widely available broadband speeds for homes and businesses.<\/p> <p>  Last year, we launched Project Lightning, a digital infrastructure investment programme that will extend the reach of our cable footprint from today's 49% to 60% of all homes by 2020.  Our network expansion programme has been possible because of Liberty Global's continued commitment to the Irish business.  As with any international organisation, however, Virgin Media must compete for investment capital with sister companies within the group.  Inward investment programmes are always dependent on a clearly defined business case with a solid return on investment.  That is why today's topic of conversation is so relevant - it touches on proposed changes, both real and suggested, that will have a real impact on our commercial operations in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will turn briefly to our involvement in the broadcasting sector in Ireland.  As a platform provider, Virgin Media has built strong partnerships with Irish free-to-air broadcasters, including RTE, TG4, TV3 and Irish production companies.  In 2011, we were the first to launch Oireachtas TV and have continued to do so at no charge to the Exchequer.  We were also the first to launch the Irish players from each of the free-to-air-channels on our Horizon TV platform, which extended the reach of these channels to Irish audiences and provided those broadcasters with opportunities to generate new advertising revenue streams.  From a community standpoint, we carry the Dublin and Cork community channels free of charge and with pride.<\/p> <p>  As the committee heard from Mr. Kiely, managing direct of the TV3 Group, the TV3 Group has expanded from two to three channels since its acquisition by Virgin Media - TV3, 3e and be3, the new name for UTV Ireland.  By undertaking the TV3 Group acquisition, Virgin Media ensured continued diversity of media plurality in the State.<\/p> <p>  I wish to discuss the draft heads of the Bill and, in particular, the proposed amendment to repeal section 103 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.  The proposed repeal is a significant issue for Virgin Media.  Our position is that we do not accept RTE's rationale for its proposal to repeal section 103 in its entirety.  The case law that RTE seeks to rely on is specific to the facts of that individual case.  At the July hearing this year, the Government indicated that it intended to repeal the section because there is no longer a public policy objective served in maintaining this exception.<\/p> <p>  It is Virgin Media's position that repealing this provision, or at the very least without qualification, will put Virgin Media at a serious disadvantage versus RTE and, separately, our competitors in the pay television market for the following reasons.  First, Virgin Media is the only television platform provider whose technical infrastructure means that we receive and then convert the broadcast signal from PSBs.  Second, it will grant RTE the opportunity to pursue Virgin Media for fees that none of our competitors pays today nor will ever have to pay.  This means that there is a real risk that Virgin Media will be discriminated against by RTE.  Third, and more fundamentally, the repealing of this provision without qualification introduces a credible threat to Virgin Media that RTE will use the repeal of this provision as a Trojan horse to introduce retransmission fees through the back door.<\/p> <p>  The committee will note I have continually emphasised that Virgin Media does not support the repeal of section 103 or, at the very least, does not support the repeal without qualification.  With this in mind, I refer members to the ongoing debates in the UK where section 73 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, which is equivalent to our section 103, has been repealed and used as the basis for ITV to make public statements that it intends to seek carriage fees from pay TV platforms.  If we are to avoid the same situation happening in Ireland, we will respectfully make a number of suggestions.  First, we ask that Virgin Media, the only cable network of scale in Ireland, is treated the same as all other television platform providers and that provisions in the Bill are clarified to ensure a level playing field for all.  Second, there should be a separate review and consultation on the impact of any potential repeal of section 103.  Third, we advocate that a dispute resolution process be provided for in the current Broadcasting Act or the proposed new Bill.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly discuss section 101 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act by focusing on two matters that were raised by RTE at the committee's July hearing.  The first pertains to a written submission by RTE to amend section 101.  In the interests of time, I do not propose to speak to this point, save to say that we strongly oppose the proposal by RTE.  My written submission to the committee will set out our detailed reasons for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Hanway"},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hanway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#K00800","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507046400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>The second point relates to RTE's call for an amendment to section 77 to be added to the draft heads of the Bill, which would allow RTE to charge platform providers for the privilege of including its content in our pay television packages.<\/p><p>Virgin Media and its parent company, Liberty Global, have always held the view that every society needs a strong, financially independent state broadcaster that offers public services within a clearly defined public service remit.  However, a harsh light needs to be shone on why RTE is pushing so hard to be allowed to charge TV operators for content.  Unfortunately, the answer lies in the fact that RTE mistakenly believes this will produce a large financial windfall that can solve its budgetary challenges while avoiding the hard decisions that would otherwise be required to manage costs.  We believe it is not in the interests of the public to throw money at the problem so as to shield RTE from these financial realities.  RTE needs instead to confront cost inflation and reform itself in order to deliver on its public service mandate effectively and efficiently, both now and in the future.<\/p><p> Let us consider RTE's specific request because it is important we have a clear understanding of what is at play here.  In its own words, RTE is seeking a simple change to section 77(11) and the insertion of two seemingly innocuous words, \"and payment\", to the \"must offer\" provision which is a requirement on RTE to give its content to platform providers.  RTE has claimed this is a simple request because retransmission fees exist elsewhere.  However, in all other instances, in all other markets, retransmission fees mean something very different from what RTE is proposing for Ireland.  Indeed, there is no like-for-like in any other market comparable to the Irish situation.  In no other market where our parent company has business operations is there a case whereby the local state broadcaster is allowed to levy a fee on platform providers for content that it \"must offer\" to platform providers. <\/p><p> Virgin Media strongly disagrees with the introduction of any amendment that will give RTE an unfettered right to demand payment from pay-TV operators for a whole host of reasons underpinned by data and rigorous research, which is presented in the Communications Chambers report which has been provided to the committee.  I do not propose to address that report today.<\/p><p> When RTE's consultancy firm, Mediatique, appeared before the committee some months ago, it presented a seemingly convincing case in setting out the amounts of money it believed would flow in the direction of RTE.  However, despite what Mediatique's crystal ball is telling its consultants, RTE will not get the financial windfall it is expecting.  In particular, Mediatique has overstated the importance to our customers of having RTE within their Virgin Media bundle.  Mediatique is operating under a misconception that RTE is uniquely important to our overall service offering.  Most of our TV customers take their TV service in a bundle with a range of services, including our market-leading high-speed broadband service.  These customers are not going to walk away from all of that value, when all that would be required to watch a show on RTE is for them to tune into the RTE player online from time to time, or switch over to Saorview.  Most of the predictions made by RTE's consultants regarding our willingness to pay for carriage of RTE channels do not make sense in reality, nor do they correspond with our first-hand knowledge of our customers.<\/p><p> In response to Mediatique's report, Virgin Media has commissioned its own study by Am&aacute;rach Research to simulate a negotiation between TV platform providers and RTE.  The results were then used to replicate Mediatique's analysis and, in particular, adapted to correct for the flaws in Mediatique's research.  One stand-out finding was that Irish households are not in favour of extra funding for RTE.  While RTE is important to our customers, TV viewing is spread across many channels.  We also found that 30% of our customers would watch RTE less, or would stop watching RTE altogether, if it was lower down on our electronic programme guide, EPG.<\/p><p> In the research, we explored the ways in which consumers would be impacted by the introduction of retransmission fees.  If we assume for a moment that pay-TV platforms agreed to pay retransmission fees and then passed this cost of doing business on to customers, consumers will be faced with three options: to pay more to retain RTE channels in their pay-TV package; to drop RTE channels from their pack and find a less convenient alternative way to watch RTE; and-or watch RTE less often.  One interesting and notable result of our research is that if it becomes more expensive or less convenient for customers to watch RTE, they will watch it less.<\/p><p> Even Mediatique has acknowledged that RTE would suffer from reductions in viewership, and therefore advertising revenue, if pay-TV platforms were no longer carrying RTE's content.  In fact, platform providers represent 52% of RTE's commercial viewership currently.  This means that, in effect, our customers account for 52% of RTE's advertising revenue, not to mention the impact on sponsorship revenue.<\/p><p> All of the foregoing leads me to believe that the narrative on this debate must change and reflect the real issues at stake here.  It is crucial that RTE has an incentive to make better use of its state funding, otherwise no amount of supplementary funding will ever eliminate the potential or inevitability of a recurring deficit.  As long as RTE is allowed to run deficits and not to configure itself into a modern broadcaster, it will keep losing money which is to the overall detriment of the sector.  Retransmission fees will not satisfy RTE's appetite for spending, nor will they inhibit RTE's practice of inflating the price of content as per comments from Pat Kiely to the committee earlier today.  Virgin Media would contend that there are many ways for RTE to improve its finances.  As a key partner to RTE, we invested approximately &euro;2 million in developing a technical solution that allows broadcasters like RTE to insert adverts dynamically into their on-demand TV content on the Virgin Media platform.  TV3 embraced this technology many years ago to great effect.  In contrast, RTE has yet to use it.<\/p><p> The RTE Player, too, is in our view under-utilised.  The player is available across 11 different platforms, but the reality is that not all platforms are equal, and RTE holds back certain programming from platforms including Virgin Media.  For example, in January 2017, 30% of the top performing content on the RTE Player was not available to our customers who, by the way, have already paid their TV licence fee and as such are entitled to access this content.<\/p><p> The reach of our fibre broadband network means that we offer the highest broadband speeds to the largest number of homes in the State.  If ever there was a platform provider to help RTE better monetise its player content, Virgin Media is that provider.<\/p><p> In summary, there is no cause or justification to amend section 77(11) and doing so would lead to the enforcement of a tax by RTE on pay-TV platform providers.  In respect of proposed changes to the CRRA, we respectfully request the separation of the repeal of section 103 from the draft heads of Bill and to undertake no changes to this section in the absence of a full and thorough regulatory impact assessment.<\/p><p>I look forward to listening to members' views and responding to their questions on these matters later in the session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Hanway","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hanway.

With me is my colleague, Mr. Glen Killane, managing director of Eir TV and Eir Sport.<\/p> <p>  Eir is Ireland&rsquo;s largest telecommunications provider, offering broadband, mobile, voice and TV services.  We have invested &euro;1.6 billion in the past five years and, specifically, we have invested over &euro;600 million in upgrading our fibre network in recent years.  This investment underpins our television and content platform, which we launched in 2013.  To enhance this platform, we acquired Setanta Sports and offer the full suite of BT sports channels.  We rebranded Setanta Sport as Eir Sport last year.  We have acquired further exclusive content and now provide over seven different channels.  Today, we have almost 75,000 subscribers to our television service and 220,000 subscribers to our Eir Sport service.<\/p> <p>  We are here to convey our concerns regarding the potential introduction of retransmission fees, which would fundamentally alter the current must carry-must offer framework and, in our opinion, would have a significantly detrimental impact on the broadcasting ecosystem in Ireland.  It is our view that the current framework governing this area is fit for purpose.  There is a symbiotic relationship between RTE and platform providers such as Eir.  RTE&rsquo;s content provides value to TV platforms like Eir, and there is also substantial value that flows in the other direction to RTE.  Platform operators provide valuable distribution for the broadcaster, which increases audience reach, and operators ensure prominent placement on the electronic programme guide, EPG, which allows the broadcaster to maximise advertising revenues and fulfil its mandate for universal access as a publicly funded broadcaster.<\/p> <p>  In our view, the proposed change to the must carry-must offer provisions has very little international precedent.  It would in effect introduce double taxation for over a million households with pay-TV subscriptions, according to the latest TAM Ireland figures, which are already paying the licence fee.<\/p> <p>  Practically speaking, the implementation of retransmission fees would be drawn out and complex and would impose a significant burden on the State&rsquo;s regulatory agencies, which already have a full agenda.  As detailed in the Communications Chambers report, as circulated to the committee, there is very little international precedent for retransmission fees, especially in jurisdictions where those broadcasters are already funded by a public licence fee.  The United States has retransmission fees, however the broadcasters that receive them do not benefit from licence fees, so it is not a valid comparison.<\/p><p>Closer to home, the UK&rsquo;s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, DCMS, considered retransmission fees in 2015 but, for reasons laid out in the Communications Chambers report, did not proceed with introducing them.  The DCMS review only addressed the case for retransmission fees for commercial terrestrial channels ITV and Channel 4, as retransmission fees for the BBC were not sought by the BBC as it is funded by the licence fee.  It is important to note that unlike the BBC, RTE already has a dual stream of income with public licence fees and commercial advertising.  What is being sought is effectively a third, additional new subsidy.<\/p><p> We also take the view that the implementation of retransmission fees would likely be complex and drawn out and it would be several years before any funds would flow to RTE.  There is no solid precedent for a standard economic methodology to set retransmission fees.  There is no mechanism or body for determining appropriate rates.  Based on what has happened elsewhere it is unclear how disputes between the broadcasters and pay TV platforms over the appropriate level of fees would be resolved.  The changes mooted to the current framework could end up requiring serious time and resources from the BAI which is the obvious dispute resolution body.  Undoubtedly this change would end up consuming scarce resources with the platform operators such as ourselves, which could otherwise be put to good use to produce either more Irish content or greater product innovation for Irish consumers.<\/p><p> We would like to frame the debate from a different perspective, one that better reflects the rapidly changing global media landscape.  Consumers are shifting away from traditional broadcast TV to view content through alternative methods provided via global internet brands such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook.  Increasingly, viewers are watching content delivered over the internet at the time they want it and on the device they want to watch it on.  Eir and other service providers are investing significantly to provide the connectivity consumers need to access this world of content.  Eir and the other Irish Pay TV platforms continue to place the RTE brand front and centre of our respective entertainment propositions and we invest heavily in product innovations that help keep RTE relevant.  The introduction of retransmission fees would significantly damage the dynamic between platform providers and the broadcasters and over time could undermine the place of RTE in over 1 million homes served by the platforms.  We suggest the focus should be on fostering even greater levels of partnership between the companies.  We look forward to continuing to explore ways to work together to meet the evolving needs of Irish viewers in a global entertainment market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Moat","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>We will now hear from Vodafone and a presentation from Mr. Liam O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#M00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507046400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to engage with it in this important legislative process.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Andrew Walsh.  I hope the committee will bear with me if I repeat or reiterate any of the points that have already been raised by my colleagues from the industry.<\/p> <p>  I will start by providing the members with a brief overview of Vodafone in Ireland as a total communications provider and more specifically our role as the newest entrant to the Irish TV market.  Vodafone provides communications services to 2.3 million customers across the country and employs over 2,000 people directly and indirectly in Ireland.  Since entering the market 15 years ago, Vodafone has been the single biggest investor in new technology in the Irish telecoms industry, with over &euro;2 billion invested to date.  Over the coming years, we have committed to investing &euro;500 million in Ireland across mobile, broadband, fibre to the home, network infrastructure and enhanced customer care systems.  More specifically, turning to the broadcasting sector and the reason we are with the committee today, Vodafone TV launched in the Irish market in January 2016.  We have invested heavily to deliver an end to end IPTV infrastructure and compelling TV solution that caters for the ways in which Irish consumers want to access content today.  Vodafone is growing fast in what is a very competitive TV marketplace, but our share currently only represents a fraction - less than 2% - of the wider pay market in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  For all the reasons already outlined today, Vodafone believes public service broadcasting in Ireland via RTE and TG4 plays a hugely important role in society.  Public service broadcasting encourages standards, more indigenous programming and, importantly, local content production.  Public service broadcasting brings us together and continues to have an important role across Irish society and daily life.  We do not wish to lose sight of this.  Under the obligations set out in the Broadcasting Act we provide users with access to RTE on Vodafone TV.  At our discretion and as part of our integrated strategy, we have provided RTE with top positioning within our electronic programming guides which as outlined already has a positive impact on RTE's ability to drive high viewing figures and significant advertising revenues across all pay TV platforms in Ireland.  Availability and ease of access is central in delivering RTE's own public service obligations.  Without repeating what has been said verbatim, we broadly support and echo the arguments put forward by the independent experts, CIL Management and Communications Chambers and the operators present here today.<\/p> <p>  A central component of this discussion and any policy options under consideration is to ensure an understanding of the evolving nature of the viewing habits of consumers here in Ireland.  Specifically, pay TV is not just about linear feeds or free-to-air TV services such as RTE, TG4 and TV3.  It is about delivering innovative solutions that allow users to pause and rewind live TV and to record and access content at their own convenience when and where it suits them.  Platforms and technology have continually evolved to provide access to what users are looking for in entertainment services, content and product features on multiple devices such as multi-room set top boxes and mobile and tablet access in and out of the home.  In order to address this evolving demand, Vodafone was the first in the market to offer Netflix as part of an integrated package.  It was a bold move.  Many in the industry might argue it is a Trojan horse for broadcasting but we cannot ignore how consumers wish to use and access media today and the product features they demand.  Central to our launch strategy last year was to ensure we provided new innovative features such as on-demand, catch-up and restart TV across multiple channels.  In the current TV market in Ireland, Vodafone now offers on-demand content across more than 50 channels.  This is not to say that linear TV feeds do not continue to play an important role and fulfil an important requirement and offering but considerable time is now spent by consumers accessing content on demand at a time that suits them, whether it is on-demand via Netflix or through the catch-up services offered on our platform.  These features and additional services outside of traditional linear TV are required to entice customers actually to pay for TV services.  We do not believe the importance of these features and additional services have been properly considered.  They are central in our ability at Vodafone and also amongst the other operators here today to recruit paying TV customers.<\/p> <p>  We would also like to highlight that we view RTE as an important partner.  There are many touch points between our organisations.  As a result of a commercial agreement with RTE, Vodafone offers RTE on-demand TV across our services platform.  Some previous public commentary has implied that existing operators do not pay anything to RTE, which is not the case.  This partnership, in addition to the advertising by Vodafone across RTE&rsquo;s platforms, sees Vodafone making a significant financial contribution that supports RTE&rsquo;s ongoing operations.<\/p> <p>  As the proponents of retransmission fees, RTE is seeking the amendment of section 77 of the 2009 Act to allow broadcasters the right to negotiate commercial terms.  The amendment in its current form has been presented by RTE as a straightforward change that would simply provide for an entitlement for RTE to be paid.  It is our clear position that the introduction of these potential retransmission fees would be fundamentally at odds with the current legislative and operational framework that supports and underpins public service broadcasting in Ireland.  This proposal does not consider the complexities involved in governing a negotiation process for public service broadcasting.  More specifically, for example there is no mention of how any fees if determined payable should be calculated, the dispute resolution mechanisms that would be required, the regulatory bodies required to mediate and the required determination of fees payable if the parties cannot agree.<\/p> <p>  Vodafone represents a fraction of the overall pay TV market at less than 2%.  How would Vodafone be treated when compared to other established operators in this regard?  The proposal to amend the legislation does not consider the complexities involved.  Any proposed changes or amendments to the existing legislation involving the introduction of retransmission fees would in our opinion be highly complex and could not be done without undertaking a complete review of all broadcasting legislation including the current licence fee regime.  Currently, legislation prohibits charges for must-carry and must-offer channels.  These enshrined principles require that pay TV platforms carry RTE, TG4 and TV3.  The current legislation makes sense in the context of zero transmission fees but does not if there are charges.<\/p> <p>  I hope the Committee has an appreciation of the position of Vodafone and of the impacts which would be felt following the introduction of any form of retransmission fees.  As outlined, we have an existing commercial partnership with RTE and other public service broadcasters, as do many of the operators here today, which we look forward to building upon in the coming years.  The current legislative framework is beneficial for both parties, the public service broadcasters and the TV platform providers, in allowing for further commercial arrangements to be developed.  Any introduction of retransmission fees will reduce the benefits enjoyed by all parties, in particular the licence fee paying public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Does the representative from CIL Management wish to make a statement or will Ms Elwes contribute during the questions afterwards?

The BAI is the competent authority and has indicated, on more than one occasion, that it believes the public service broadcaster will be compromised in terms of reaching its legislative remit as a public service broadcaster unless it gets additional funding.<\/p> <p>  I accept that RTE has a long way to go to trim its sails and focus its attention on the future so that it is an organisation that is fit for purpose.  When RTE was before us, I was very direct with the director general, DG, and said that before we would consider addressing its financial shortfall it would have to put in place a plan with which we were comfortable and which demonstrated to us that it was willing to take up the challenge.  In follow-up conversations with the DG and others, it is my view that it is serious about this but, despite that, there remains a crisis.  It is not just the demise of RTE or a public service broadcaster, it is a threat to democracy as we know it.  Once one moves away from recognised, branded news and current affairs and moves into the world of Google, Facebook and social media platforms, the connection between the origin of news and its authenticity and verification can be seriously compromised.  A lot of talk, time and effort has been put into following whether or not Russia had an input into the outcome of the most recent US presidential election.  It is not such a far-fetched step to believe that, where a public service broadcaster diminishes and there is a failure to protect and preserve the ethics of journalism then, over time, there is a tendency to white out content that is properly curated, properly verified editorially and comes from an authentic source, all of which has a potential impact on democracies.  The witnesses before us and the public service broadcaster share the same space and one or other spoke of the necessity to develop a closer partnership to work against the threat of the likes of Google, Facebook and others which do not see themselves as publishers or broadcasters but merely in terms of access to information.<\/p> <p>  The debate needs to move on.  If one believes in public service broadcasting one must be prepared to follow it through and be prepared to pay for it.  The viewer pays at the moment and we can have arguments about double taxation or where something is already paid for but, if the public service cannot do what it is required to do and what we, in a functioning democracy, want it to do, there is a problem.  If we need a vibrant, diversified broadcasting market we have to look seriously at how we address it and that means looking at a proper funding model.  In the context of retransmission, all we are asking for, and what we have been asked for by the Minister following the heads of the Bill, is to get out of the way to give the witnesses and RTE the capacity to negotiate.  The witnesses have set out their stall, as has RTE, and I do not see us getting into the negotiations as it is not our role.  It is a matter of removing the provision from the legislation and allowing a sensible dialogue also involving, if necessary, the BAI.<\/p> <p>  I went through the submissions and have some questions.  My first is to the platform operators.  A lot has been made of the delicate broadcasting ecology of channel providers, platforms, must-offer or must-carry rules, the threat that charging for content could pose and electronic programming guide prominence and I accept the point that anything that interfered with them could be damaging to all parties.  To which operators are these rules applicable?  The Vodafone representative, Mr. O'Brien, said, \"At our discretion and as part of our integrated strategy, we have provided RTE with top positioning within our electronic programming guides\".  This appears to be a commercial decision and not one imposed by the legislation.  Can the witnesses clarify that?  Virgin appeared to be of the same view.  Does the prominence requirements for public service channels not apply, so that it is at their discretion too?  Are the requirements of section 77 regarding prominence applicable to Sky?  I know it gives RTE very significant prominence but is it required to do that?  The must-carry rule does not apply to Sky, as I understand it, and it seems the negotiation with RTE is a little one-way in Sky's favour.  There is no electronic programming guide prominence requirement, no must-carry requirement but a must-offer requirement on RTE.  If prominence has been accorded to the commercial negotiations in which they were involved, why would facilitating RTE in negotiating its channels not be part of them?  It seems sensible to me.  I get the fact that there are issues that need to be addressed but all it would do is free up the capacity for both sides to negotiate.<\/p> <p>  I have some sympathy with Mr. Wheeldon, who had to play the bad cop to some extent.  He delivered a rather strong message and he has to do that on behalf of his company.  He said, \"Regardless of any legislative change or the value that RTE does or does not deliver to our platform, there are no circumstances in which we would change our approach and begin to make payments for a free-to-air channel in any of our markets simply because of the precedent that it would set for us elsewhere.\"  It does not sit well with me as a legislator to be told that by Sky.  I will let other people work out what I mean.  I respect the fact that he is representing his company but I do not take it too well.  We have a job to do and I have outlined from the start what that job is.  At its core, it is about the preservation and protection of our identity as an independent country.  It is about our culture, our music, our news, our current affairs and wanting to protect democracy.<\/p><p>I do not believe that is the best way to go.  That might be better for the arguments with RTE, but not here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#N00300","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I realise we are under pressure for time.  I wish to make a number of points.  Some of them may be related and some may not, but I will try to cover them as quickly as possible.  The scenario today reminds me a little of a court, when the prosecution has made its case over the course of the day.  The pendulum swings and there is another day for the defence.  We have had that.  It is in reverse order on this occasion.  RTE appears to be in the dock somehow in the submissions made, but that is to be expected given the nature of the hearing today.  It is one-sided.<\/p> <p>  In terms of content, there have been references to public service broadcasting and having to carry it.  I understand that they must carry it and offer terms and concepts, but it can work the other way as well.  Recently, I was in the market for my home TV package.  I rang around and talked to different providers.  I cannot remember who I was talking to on one call, and it is probably just as well, but the person mentioned that certain channels would not be available if I was on another package or went with another platform.  One of the channels I was going to lose was Sky Atlantic, which was a source of concern because it is a good channel.  The predominant programme at the time was \"Game of Thrones\", but the call centre adviser helpfully pointed out that the series was about to come to an end.  It was happy days because I could move off the platform, lose the programme and by the time two years went by and a new series was made, move back again.  It can work both ways.  It is not just RTE that is trying to get the number one spot, Sky Atlantic can be in the mix as well fighting for coverage.  It can dictate a viewer's choice of platform.<\/p> <p>  Another point was mentioned by Deputy Dooley, and Mr. Moat talked about it as well.  I wonder if we could be missing a trick in this debate.  One of the issues that comes up is predominance and Mr. Wheeldon - I will return to his other comments shortly - spoke about the priority in terms of programming on the schedule.  RTE One is number one at present.  Could it be number 501 if it does not play ball, dirties its bib or things do not work out so well commercially?  What implications will there be and what dire consequences will that have for the company?<\/p> <p>  If I talk to my teenage children about the broadcasting schedule and ask them if they want to look at the TV guide when I buy the newspaper at the weekend, they look at me as if I have two heads.  They do not understand the concept of a TV scheduling guide or how that works.  They are buried in their iPhones, iPads or other electronic devices consuming media.  Some of those have been mentioned, such as Netflix, and are well understood, but there is also YouTube and a variety of other platforms that I will not try to name.  That is relevant today and tomorrow and probably will be ten years hence.  As the discussion on our consumption patterns moves on I wonder how relevant the schedule will be.  We might be getting tied in knots about something that might not be as relevant a couple of years from now.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Wheeldon spoke on behalf of Sky international, I presume.  It was not Sky Ireland in any event.  He made a number of comments and I agree with what Deputy Dooley said.  He seems to be teeing up a David and Goliath battle between RTE, the State broadcaster in Ireland, and Sky international and the great power that colossus could bring to the table.  That is not a great way to approach a legislative assembly.  As Deputy Dooley said, if we were to take that speech verbatim we might as well shut up shop here, fold the tent, walk out the door and give up on the whole thing.  It was a draconian spectacle.  It reminds me of advice I got when I first got involved in politics - when one is having a debate or interaction with somebody who is in a position of influence, one is there to win the vote not the argument.  That might be a good point for everybody to take away from this meeting.<\/p> <p>  On content, we touched on the idea of whether it is public service broadcasting or public service content.  However, there is also content which the public service broadcaster offers and which might not necessarily fit strictly within the definition of public service broadcasting.  It could be quality, sought-after content of a different nature.  I note the submission from Screen Producers Ireland, which has a number of concerns about the proposed approach.  If I understand matters correctly, its members would be in favour retransmission fees.  They refer to things such as the cable copyright exemption and the fact that much of the content its members produce is made available through national stations.  They would lose out on that revenue or funding income were it not to come to pass.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to my final question.  There is an intuitive attractive argument that if one pays to create something, be it a manuscript, TV programme or piece of music, it is a fundamental concept that one owns that or some right to royalties from it and that if one lets somebody else produce it, be it on a stage, play it at a concert or reproduce it on a TV platform, they should pay for it.  That appears to be intuitive.  I am not saying that I am taking a position on the Bill, but it appears to be an intuitive argument.  To follow through on that, and perhaps I am asking the wrong people and the question should be directed to RTE, where does the money go?  If retransmission fees kick in and if we go along with this argument, and there is an instinctive intuitive rationale to that argument, they should carry through to the content creators and producers and the continuation of that indigenous resourcing.  Perhaps, in fairness, that is not a question for the witnesses but for the other side of the table, but I have voiced it in any event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#O00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I find myself at variance with Deputy Dooley.  I am on the opposite side of this.  RTE has financial problems and they must be solved.  The idea that one part of the resolution is for RTE to tap into the pay TV platforms in Ireland and get an extra bite at the cherry, after receiving over &euro;160 from every taxpayer in the country, is completely unacceptable.  It is a question of double payment.  We pay RTE &euro;160 per household.  For most taxpayers in Ireland it means one has to earn &euro;320 in gross income to pay RTE &euro;160, with the Government taking the other &euro;160 of that &euro;320 to start with.  The question of how licence fees are paid or not paid is something we discussed last week and I do not intend to return to it.  However, the idea that services such as Sky and the other services represented here should be required to pay RTE for the privilege of carrying its channel on the basis on which they do so at present appears to be completely inconsistent.  It is an effort to extract more money from the same product, instead of querying whether the product is viable in its current financial form.  Like Deputy Dooley, I support the idea of public service broadcasting but I know, because I have been to TV3's studios as well as those of RTE, that there is a huge job to be done in RTE, which is not to be assisted by throwing lifebelts of a source of funding here or there.  It is doing well from the Irish taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  I pay for the Sky package.  I apologise to the other representatives as I do not pay for theirs.  Having had three young gentlemen in my house I pay for the full package and get everything.  In addition, I am in the happy position that I am also paying the subscription for the old cable TV coming into the house.  ITV is on that cable, but it is not on Sky.  It is not watched in our house.  Nobody even goes hunting for it.  The availability of channels, be it on fibre or otherwise, has dramatically improved the TV service to ordinary Irish households.  The increase in choice ranging from National Geographic Channel to foreign news channels to arts and culture programmes is hugely beneficial to Irish households.  There should be no doubt about that.  The viewer's experience is hugely enhanced by TV platforms above the Saorview package, if I may use that term.  We cannot be troglodytes - the word \"cave\" has been used in this context by the former Minister, former Deputy Pat Rabbitte - about this.  The world is changing and information is transmitted in very different ways.  When the Minister sent this Bill to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny, he said that this is a matter on which there are two sides.<\/p><p>I want to make it very clear I am utterly opposed to giving in to RTE in these circumstances.  It is a man claiming to be drowning and demanding immediate help when he will not actually swim.  I know that is probably politically unwise of me to say, given the dominance of RTE in Irish broadcasting, but I really believe there is nothing to be lost and everything to be gained by a partnership approach to this.  I do not believe RTE needs to get into the negotiations in question and I do not in any sense resent somebody telling me that they may play hardball in those negotiations.  I know it is not meant as a threat to us.  We can vote whatever way we like in these Houses and do whatever we want.  I do not resent it at all.  I believe RTE has to be told the blunt truth that it may end up as ITV is in my house - off the screen completely.  It may then come whingeing that it needs more money because its advertising has collapsed even further.  We will then say it did not make that case a few years ago and that it told us this was easy money and an easy way to keep it solvent.  It is not.  I am very much of the view that we are failing to grasp the RTE nettle.  It is hugely overly costly as a service.  It needs to stop looking around for different ways whereby ordinary Irish viewers have to subsidise it and instead get its act together about the &euro;160 and about the &euro;180 million it is getting every year.  I will not put it any further.  I do not really require any response.  I am just saying I am on the side of the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#O00300","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Wheeldon to respond.

To be honest, I do not think we are that far apart.  I wholly agree with the Deputies' analysis of the issue on the provision of news.  We operate a loss-making television news service.  We have just invested in a new correspondent in Dublin despite the fact it is a loss-making television news service.  We find it very hard to monetise that, especially with the encroachment of the digital platforms, such as Google, Facebook and the others.  It is a massive challenge and I wholly understand that.  We believe, though, that we are a really strong partner for the Irish public service broadcaster.  We also support public service broadcasting in all the markets we are in.  We believe in linear television and it is at the heart of our service.  We believe in local television, that is, local to the markets and reflecting the culture and the news of those markets.  That is what our proposition is built upon.  That is what differentiates us from Facebook, Google, Netflix, Amazon and all the rest.  We are absolutely there.  That is the reason we voluntarily comply with all of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, rules.  We have chosen to do that because we recognise it is really important for the consumers in the market we are in.<\/p> <p>  On a little technical detail, although we do not have quite the same rules around must-carry, we are an open platform.  Under European rules, if a broadcaster wants to broadcast on our platform, we have to provide it with the technical services that enable it to do that.  That is the point about our platform, which is different from any others in that we are required to be open.  I understand the committee members felt that what I was saying was an implicit threat.  I apologise.  It was not meant as that.  I thought they would appreciate some honesty.<\/p> <p>  The honest truth is we are a pay TV platform.  When a customer sits in a Saorview home and decides they want to pay to watch pay TV and they buy Sky, they do not buy Sky to buy RTE.  They buy Sky to buy the pay channels.  The reality is that if Ireland decides to go down this route, it is setting up a negotiation, as the committee members suggested, between us and RTE, and it has to know what we as a pay operator would do in those circumstances.  We cannot pay for something that our customers do not value getting from us and can get for free elsewhere.  It would undermine our fundamental model, not just in this market but in all of our markets.  This was not meant as an idea that we were trying to use our power in other markets to influence this committee, merely that, as a pay operator, in any of our markets, whether in the UK, Ireland or Italy, if we paid for free things, we would very quickly end up in the same place as many others, even maybe in RTE's place, and we would be saying this is not sustainable.  We have to be honest with the committee.<\/p> <p>  I genuinely believe that all of us around this table believe in public broadcasting and believe that we can be good partners to RTE.  We have put things and want to put more things on the table that will help to address some of the issues committee members are concerned about, but going down this legislative route is preventing us at the moment from proceeding with those negotiations and could end up making the situation worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Wheeldon"},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I will bring in Mr. Zeff and will then go back to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#P00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507046400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>From our point of view, this is not a question around the importance of public service broadcasting.  Indeed, I have spent many years of my career thinking about questions in the UK Government around how to ensure the sustainability of public service broadcasting.  What we did in our analysis was to look at the practical consequences and risks around the introduction of retransmission fees.  We have seen there are a number of quite significant risks around it.  In particular, the international experience where retransmission fees exist, particularly from the US but also from markets like that of Italy, is that there are a lot of commercial disputes.  In fact, in the US, blackouts of channels from pay platforms are very common as a result, with some 800 blackouts since 2010.  Many of the pay platforms in the US, when they pay retransmission fees, add an explicit charge onto their bills for consumers.  Members will see on page 5 of our submission that we have pulled out an example of that.  We think there is a particular risk that this will be seen, by most consumers, as a double charge for channels they have already paid for.  This risks undermining support for the licence fee and the public service broadcasting system it is supposed to support.<\/p> <p>  Modelling of the outcome is almost impossible to do.  In fact, Mathew Horsman of Mediatique said very clearly when he was before this committee earlier in the year that it is impossible in practice to predict the outcome of the commercial negotiations.  When the Department for Culture, Media and Sport looked at this in the UK and looked at the modelling of potential outcomes of commercial negotiations around retransmission fees, it came up with a very wide range of possible results, including substantial payments to the broadcasters, but also including the possibility that it would end up with substantial payments from the broadcasters to the platforms.  The other point to make is that retransmission fees, as we know, are incompatible with the current must-carry framework, which means they put at risk the universal availability of public service platforms, which I would see as one of the key fundamental principles that underpins public service broadcasting.<\/p> <p>  Those are essentially the reasons the UK Government rejected the introduction of retransmission fees, having considered this over a two-year process through consultation, consideration and independent analysis.  It felt it would not be a practical way of supporting the future of public service broadcasting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jon Zeff"},{"type":"speech","time":1507046400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Zeff.

On a slight reference to what Senator McDowell has indicated, as a society and as a Legislature, we need to define what it is we want our public service broadcaster to be.  While I do not disagree with everything Senator McDowell has said, RTE carries two orchestras and TG4 is run separately.  It has given us the explanation behind this, although I still think it has a long way to go to get a model.  We have taken its representatives through those issues, we have roasted them and we will continue to do that to get them focused.  However, there is the elasticity argument that if one is trying to extract more and still expect the public service broadcaster to do it at the same cost, then at some point it snaps.  That is where we have a fundamental problem.<\/p><p>It is not all about getting more money to keep doing the same thing.  RTE has to change and we need to see that.

To the greatest extent possible, we also have to try to understand where there is potential for increased moneys to support public service broadcasting in a very changed environment.

We have met with RTE to discuss various things, including helping it to target advertising more effectively through our AdSmart system, making RTE Player available on the Now TV platform, and putting RTE box sets in the Sky Store where they can be monetised.  We have also had discussions about commissioning productions together.  There are many opportunities to work together, but as we have referenced, going down this route would not be helpful for the overall relationship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100300002#Q01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. J.D.

The double taxation agreement with Kazakhstan was signed by the ambassador of Ireland to the Russian Federation, Mr. Adrian McDaid, on 26 April 2017.  The tax information exchange agreement with Macao was signed on 12 September 2016 by the ambassador of Ireland to the People's Republic of China, Mr. Paul Kavanagh.<\/p> <p>  Double taxation agreements are essential in order to allow Ireland to develop greater opportunities for international trade and investment by reducing the number of tax impediments that may inhibit cross-border activity.  Ireland has signed 73 double taxation agreements, of which 72 are in effect.  Ireland is a small country which is highly reliant on trade and investment with other countries, and our large network of tax agreements is very important in facilitating this.  Double taxation agreements facilitate trade and investment in a number of ways.  They provide greater predictability and fairness for taxpayers regarding their tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions and are key to the prevention of double taxation.  This is achieved through the formal allocation of clear taxing rights to one of the countries or, if both countries hold taxing rights, by providing that the authority in the country in which the taxpayer is resident grants a tax credit for the tax paid in the other jurisdiction.  Double taxation agreements reduce the risk of excessive taxation that may arise because of high withholding taxes and ensure that taxpayers are not subject to discriminatory taxation in other jurisdictions.  They also facilitate mutual agreement procedures which allow the tax authorities of both countries to consult with each other in taxation matters affecting the agreement and include provisions that allow for the exchange of information for the purpose of preventing tax evasion.  Double taxation agreements cover direct taxes - in our case, income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax - and apply to the taxation of both companies and individuals.  The double taxation agreement with Kazakhstan is comprehensive in scope and generally follows the OECD model convention.  It provides that certain income arising in one contracting state and paid to a resident of the other contracting state is exempt from tax in the source state.  Where income or gains remain taxable in both countries, the agreement provides that Ireland will grant a credit against its own tax for tax payable in Kazakhstan.  The agreement similarly provides that Kazakhstan will allow a deduction against tax paid by a resident in Kazakhstan of an amount equal to the tax paid in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  To date Ireland has signed 26 tax information exchange agreements, of which 25 are in effect.  These agreements require parties to exchange information where the information requested is \"foreseeably relevant\" to a tax investigation in the other state.  The tax information exchange agreements concluded by Ireland are all based on the OECD model tax information exchange agreements.  This model grew out of the work undertaken by the OECD to address harmful tax practices globally and now represents the gold standard.  The agreements cover all taxes imposed by each state at the time of the agreement together with any identical or substantially similar taxes imposed at a later date.  In the case of Ireland, this is income tax, including the universal social charge, corporation tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and value added tax.  The tax information exchange agreements are limited to exchange upon request; they do not provide for automatic exchange of information between states.  Following ratification, discussions are expected to take place with Macao on how the agreement will be adapted to allow for automatic exchange.  The automatic exchange of information between jurisdictions is now being provided for through the new OECD common reporting standard to which more than 100 other countries, including Ireland, have committed.  The automatic exchange of information between tax authorities is a valuable tool in the fight against tax fraud and evasion and we look forward to its further implementation at an EU and global level.  In August, the OECD-led Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes awarded Ireland the highest international rating of \"fully compliant\" with international best practices on tax transparency and exchange of information.  The OECD's global forum is a multilateral framework for tax transparency and information-sharing, within which more than 140 jurisdictions participate on an equal footing.<\/p><p>The outcome of the forum's review is a recognition of Ireland's continued commitment to the highest international standards in tax transparency.<\/p><p> Earlier this year, Ireland was among the first countries to sign the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.  This important international agreement is commonly known as the BEPS multilateral instrument, MLI, and will bring Ireland's existing tax treaties into line with the OECD BEPS recommendations and ensure that they cannot be used for aggressive tax planning arrangements.<\/p><p> It is expected that the majority of Ireland's treaties will be modified by the MLI.  However, Ireland is also implementing the anti-BEPS recommendations on a bilateral basis with a small number of treaty partners.  As to treaty partners that are not signatories to the MLI, Ireland has written to them to discuss options for implementing the BEPS recommendations.<\/p><p> It is the Minister for Finance's intention to bring an order relating to the BEPS MLI to this committee as part of its ratification process sometime next year.  In addition, there is a strong pipeline of new tax agreements coming down the tracks.  Negotiations for agreements with Azerbaijan, Ghana and Turkmenistan have concluded and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working towards arranging the signature of these new agreements.  Negotiations with a couple of countries have also concluded and permission to allow for their signature is in the process of being obtained.  The renegotiation of the treaty with the Netherlands has also concluded.  Ireland is negotiating new treaties with a number of countries while renegotiations are under way in respect of existing treaties in other cases, including that with the USA.<\/p><p> The Minister for Finance and I, as well as officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, will continue to seek to maintain and enhance our tax treaty network.  We continue to engage with stakeholders in identifying other jurisdictions where tax agreements would be beneficial for Irish business.  We are also continuing in our efforts to open negotiations with other jurisdictions that we have, as yet, been unable to secure.  These agreements will play a pivotal role in the strengthening of our economic recovery.<\/p><p> The committee's consideration of these international agreements is an important step in their ratification process.  Draft Government orders confirming and giving effect in Ireland to the agreements were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 19 September in accordance with the provisions of section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  A resolution by the D&aacute;il approving the draft orders is required before the Government can make them.  The proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approve the draft orders has been referred to this committee for consideration and, after that consideration, the draft orders will be referred back to the D&aacute;il for approval.  After that, the Government may make the orders and the agreements will then be included in a schedule to the taxes Acts by means of a section in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  At that stage, the Irish ratification procedures will be concluded.  Once both countries have completed their procedures, the agreements will take effect in accordance with their entry-into-force provisions.<\/p><p> I commend these draft orders to the committee and, if required, I will be happy to answer whatever questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017100300002#B00100","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507035600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Let me put my comments in context.  I had a particular interest in Kazakhstan because, as a member of the European Parliament, I was part of a delegation that travelled to Central Asia.  I visited a group of workers in Kazakhstan who were subsequently massacred in December 2011 in a really brutal situation with mining workers in Zhanaozen.

The court advertised its intention to undertake an examination of the CIF request and it invited submissions.  Four submissions were received, from the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Unite the union and the trustees of the construction workers' pension scheme.  All submissions supported the application by the CIF before the court.  Subsequently, the court convened a hearing on the matter and the parties that had made written submissions also made oral submissions.  Following this, and being satisfied that making a recommendation would promote harmonious relations between workers and employers and assist in the avoidance of industrial unrest in the construction sector, the Labour Court submitted a recommendation to the Minister on 13 July 2017.<\/p><p> The recommendation has been considered by the Minister in line with the terms of the legislation and the court was notified in August that the Minister was accepting the recommendation.  In making the recommendation the Labour Court must consider the factors under section 16(2) of the Act.  These include the potential impact of the making of an order on the levels of employment and unemployment in the identified economic sector, the impact it might have on competitiveness in the economic sector concerned and that the sectoral employment order would be binding on all workers and employers in that economic sector.  The 2015 Act requires the Minister, within six weeks of receipt of the Labour Court recommendation, either to accept or reject the recommendation and to make an order to give legal effect to the terms of the recommendation.  The Act provides that the order must come to this committee and to the Houses for the approval of both Houses before it can be made.<\/p><p> A draft of the order was laid before the Houses on 22 August 2017, as required by section 17(4) of the Act, but due to the summer recess the approval of the Houses could not be obtained at that time.  However, a commitment was given that the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas would be sought at the earliest opportunity.  I thank the committee in this regard.  Clearly, we are anxious to maintain stability in employment terms and conditions in the construction sector.  I hope the committee will refer the order back to both Houses for approval so that we can bring the order into effect as soon as possible.  It is desirable and hugely in the interests of harmonious industrial relations in the construction sector to have the order confirmed at the earliest possible date.  When the order comes into effect, its terms will be binding across the sector and enforceable by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#B00600","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507042800,"counter":282,"content":"<p>There are no questions on the briefing and the members are happy with the order.

I am accompanied by the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, who has responsibility for innovation, research and development.  We have given the committee a briefing and I hope it will give members a clear understanding of what we are delivering for the money voted by the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  To summarise briefly, the 2017 total gross allocation for my Department and its offices and agencies is &euro;858.42 million, an increase of approximately 6% on last year's allocation of &euro;810.47 million as per the published Revised Estimates Volume.  The Department's allocation is divided between &euro;303.4 million in current expenditure and &euro;555 million in capital expenditure.  The current expenditure allocation includes an additional &euro;3 million in Brexit-specific pay moneys provided in budget 2017 to support the recruitment of an additional 40 to 50 staff across the Department's Vote.  I will confine my remarks to jobs and enterprise development and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, will provide details on the Department's innovation programme.  If it suits the committee I will speak again when we move to section C with regard to regulation.<\/p> <p>  The total gross capital and current expenditure by the Department in the first six months of 2017 was &euro;333.96 million.  At that point it was &euro;26.5 million behind the expected expenditure position as profiled at the start of the year, or just under 8%.  In terms of current expenditure, the end of June position shows that gross expenditure was &euro;135.9 million, which is approximately &euro;6 million behind the original profile.  The main reason for this relates to variances in pay and non-pay expenditure.  These were due to a number of factors, including delays in relocating a number of departmental units, delays in filling vacancies in varying areas, timing delays and so forth.<\/p><p>Gross capital expenditure to the end of June was just over &euro;198 million, which is &euro;20.5 million behind the original profile.  As the committee will be well aware, variances in capital expenditure can arise for a number of reasons, including timing of demands for grant offerings, timing of expenditure reports being submitted by agency clients, agencies own-resource income, which is a feature here, property-related issues and the quality of grant applications being made to an agency.  Notwithstanding the capital expenditure variance at the end of June, it is my expectation that there will be a full spend of the Department's capital allocation in 2017.  As advised, my Department secured additional capital by way of a Supplementary Estimate in 2015 and 2016.  These moneys enabled it to meet some existing commitments and thereby enhanced the new business capacity of a number of its agencies for future years.  In the event that capital savings arise elsewhere across the Exchequer by year-end, my Department will explore, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, the possibility of seeking another Supplementary Estimate in late 2017.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly outline some of the aspects of the work of the Department in the jobs and enterprise area.  At the end of 2016, more than 435,000 people were working in client companies being supported directly by the Department's enterprise agencies.  That is an all-time record level of employment across the agencies.  Allowing for the multiplier effect, I think it is safe to say a similar number of people were being indirectly supported in services and sub-supply.  This means that in excess of 850,000 people - or two out of every five of those in employment - throughout the country are being supported through the enterprise agencies.  Furthermore, it is interesting to note that approximately 90% of the Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland directly-supported jobs are full-time in nature.<br\/><br\/>During 2016, the enterprise development programmes of the Department's enterprise agencies also continued to make a significant contribution to growing employment in the regions with 52% of new jobs created by IDA Ireland clients and 61% of jobs created by Enterprise Ireland clients in 2016 being based outside of Dublin.  IDA Ireland client companies created a total of 11,842 net new jobs across a range of sectors last year, with every region posting net gains.  Total employment in overseas companies at the end of 2016 was 199,877, the highest figure ever recorded.  I am pleased to state that progress has continued in 2017.  IDA Ireland <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">job approvals are up 22% in 2017 compared with the first half of 2016.  Investments approved by IDA Ireland in the first half of 2017 will lead to the creation of more than 11,000 jobs as companies roll out their plans in the coming months and years.<\/font><br\/><br\/>The increased allocation made to the IDA Ireland's capital base in 2017 has allowed it to continue to further progress its regional property programme.  In the first half of 2017, advanced facilities have already been constructed and completed in Sligo, Castlebar and Tralee.  Preparations in respect of delivering advanced facilities and buildings at other regional locations also continues, with a further six expected to be completed in 2018.<br\/><br\/>More than 201,000 people are now directly employed by Enterprise Ireland-supported companies, the highest in the history of the agency<b>. <\/b>Significantly, 65% or 130,000 of those jobs are located outside Dublin.  Enterprise Ireland clients also recorded export sales of &euro;21.6 billion in 2016, an increase of 6% on 2015.  This is a good news story in terms of job creation generally, regional job creation in particular and exports.<br\/><br\/>In May 2017 Enterprise Ireland launched a new regional enterprise development fund to the value of &euro;60 million over a number of years.  The fund is a competitive one and it will support the regional Action Plan for Jobs and the Action Plan for Rural Development as they are rolled out.  There will be many collaborative initiatives in respect of that fund building on industry strengths and driving job creation across the regions.<br\/><br\/>The local enterprise offices, LEOs, play a key role in supporting employment.  LEO-supported clients created 7,883 gross new jobs across all regions.  That resulted in a net gain of an extra 3,679<b><\/b>new jobs.  At the end of 2016, the number employed across LEO client companies reached 34,000 jobs<b><\/b>in total.  This year the LEOs have targeted the approval of 920 projects for grant support, with an associated full-time equivalent of more than 2,300 new jobs.  They have set ambitious targets in terms of mentoring and participation.  They appear to be on course to deliver their targets for 2017 with the approval of 461 projects around the country in the first six months of 2017, which are projected to deliver more than 1,100 new jobs.<br\/><br\/>The big issue facing the country - not least businesses and the enterprise sector - is Brexit.  It is a generational challenge for all member states of the EU, not least Ireland.  Clearly, there are threats and opportunities posed by the challenge of Brexit and that is a primary focus of Departments.  We are central to the diplomatic effort that is ongoing, in addition to my colleagues across the Government.  We are engaging with our EU partners, including the European Commission, individual member states and the European Parliament, as we saw today.  We very much want to get across to them the uniqueness of Ireland's relationship with the UK and the potential impact of Brexit on Ireland.  We are also engaging with counterparts in the UK at ministerial level.  Members have a detailed briefing on that so I will not go into it in any greater depth.<br\/><br\/>The Action Plan for Jobs has a particular focus on Brexit and we are also carrying out a review of Enterprise 2025 in the context of Brexit.  Every item of policy and work in other areas has to be Brexit-proofed in order that we might ensure that we have both the right policies and the specific policy responses in place.  We are looking at a number of policy responses to help business as well.  I could go into detail on those.  My Department also has a number of initiatives in place to allow it - across the board - to have a better response to Brexit.  I could go into detail on those if members would like me to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#C00800","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507042800,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste very much.

I shared some of my experiences of the agency when living in Australia during the height of the economic crisis with the former Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor.  It was said that we are going to face the biggest economic crisis in decades.  The biggest economic crisis we have had was nine years ago, not decades in the past.  While Brexit will be a huge challenge, the unemployment rate is now down to 6.1%, which indicates that the agencies have been performing.  In the interest of balance, perhaps the T&aacute;naiste could furnish the committee with more or simpler specifics about the return from those agencies over the past three to four years and their achievements since the Action Plan for Jobs was put in place.  More investment will be needed, which I would welcome, in particular in regard to the Asia Pacific region.  I welcome the contribution of ConnectIreland in terms of its provision of opportunities of referrals through social meetings, in particular for emigrants who were not at board of management level or similar, and it was very much on the tip of emigrants' tongues because of that.  One could often find out about jobs through social and personal interactions.  A departmental official said that one of the biggest referrals to him through ConnectIreland resulted in several new jobs in the regions and that is to be welcomed.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to furnish the committee with specific statistics on efficiencies.  It is all very well having several personnel in an agency but increased efficiency and the consideration of that must be targeted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#F00400","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1507042800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's point.  It is interesting to note that Enterprise Ireland has supported the highest level of jobs ever.  It has added more than 10,000 jobs per annum since 2012.  As Senator Gavan pointed out, that was done with reduced staff resources.  It has become more expert.  I was on a trade mission last week with Enterprise Ireland representatives and I saw it reaching out to businesses, the initiatives it is taking and the way it is working.  The level of expertise within the agency has grown and the return on that can be seen in terms of jobs.  Its target is 60,000 extra jobs and &euro;56 billion in exports by 2020.  We are seeing a return on investment in it.  There was a constant series of new job announcements from January to August of this year in the food and aviation sectors and so on.  There were announcements of 150 new jobs in Dawn Farm Foods in February, 200 new jobs in Fenergo in Dublin, two new jobs in Coolmore Foods, 80 new jobs in Parc Aviation in Shannon, new jobs in Cork and other parts of the country and that list goes on.  The return is there.  It is a very expert agency.  There is a high level of praise from companies in Ireland and abroad for the expertise that has been developed in Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  Businesses are comparing them with other such agencies worldwide and say the level of service from Enterprise Ireland and the IDA is second to none, which is absolutely true and we are seeing the return on that.  I take the point that there is no room for complacency in the context of our very challenging situation, as Senator Gavan said.  We need to keep the effort up to ensure we can deal with the challenges posed by Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#F00500","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1507042800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I want to briefly confirm what the T&aacute;naiste has said.

For agencies from a small country, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in particular punch well above their weight across and outside Europe under very difficult circumstances.

The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, will support me on that.

Brexit is a huge challenge but, as Deputy Neville said, the financial crash we experienced a number of years ago was also a huge challenge and many people wrote the country off and said it could not succeed in getting out of it.  We were laughed out of court when it was said that we would create 100,000 jobs but that has been done and surpassed.<\/p><p>I congratulate the Ministers on the ongoing success in reducing unemployment and increasing the number of people at work.  I welcome the approach regarding ConnectIreland, which made a strong presentation to the committee.  It has a role in creating more jobs and, given the challenges that we face, we need to avail of every strand of job creation.<\/p><p> As opposed to their numbers, I acknowledge the quality of people working in Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and elsewhere.  It is important.  It is probably a good sign of the economy being so strong that all of the quality people are already gainfully employed and we must tease them back to the Department and Enterprise Ireland to help us attract more jobs.<\/p><p> The figures for the cost of job creation that the T&aacute;naiste mentioned do not just reflect what she alluded to, but also the attractiveness of Ireland as a country in which to live and work.  That is due to societal change and an approach to the value of work.  The Government is right to discuss increasing the threshold for the marginal rate to make work more valuable for people instead of increasing the base cost for prospective employers.  Let people take more money home in their pockets and give them more disposable pay.  People will argue that we need more money for services, which we do.  Thanks to the approach that has been taken, though, we actually have more money now.  In every sector, more money is being invested in many services.<\/p><p> I wish to raise with the T&aacute;naiste an issue that has significant potential to create further jobs in tourism, namely, greenways.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Chairman will be aware of the greenway in Waterford.  The classic one is in Mayo and cost &euro;12 million to put in place but returned that amount in one year.  Greenways present opportunities for coastal routes in north County Dublin, particularly given the train stations.  People could cycle out from the city.  The 27 million people arriving at the airport would have somewhere to go.  Cafes, restaurants and other businesses would spring up along the route.  It is a stunning, coastal route.  This is a no-brainer.  I hope that the T&aacute;naiste will use her undoubted powers of persuasion on the Minister for Finance to ensure that extra money is invested in greenways.  I do not just mean for north Dublin, but for a pot of money.  Previously, I called for &euro;200 million to develop greenways.<\/p><p> From the Global Economic Forum of a number of years ago, we know that there is an ever-increasing population of people between the ages of 60 and 80 years who are relatively wealthy, well and healthy, and are looking for entertainment and things to do.  Walking and cycling are the sorts of thing that interest them.  Flipping it over to the younger population of Dublin, for people to be able to go for a cycle with their families in safety is difficult to do now.  Rural roads are not safe for that type of cycling and the city is not inviting in that regard.  A safe cycleway along the coast of north County Dublin or all the way back to the south county - that would not bother me - would have societal gains from the point of view of families being outside and exercising together.  All of that is positive.  I did not want to let the opportunity pass without mentioning it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#F01100","speaker":"1421","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507042800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>In terms of the development of greenways, the economic indicators in Scotland, Switzerland, Austria and so on for the past ten or 15 years have shown their economic value.

As the Chairman knows, 37 or 40 small businesses - pubs and restaurants - have been reinvigorated and redeveloped along the Waterford-Dungarvan greenway.  Senator Reilly is correct.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, F&aacute;ilte Ireland started promoting greenways, particularly in countries like France and the Netherlands where people are big into their cycling, parts of northern England and so on.  This summer, we saw people from those countries travelling to Ireland specifically to cycle on our greenways and stay in the hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation along them.  It will probably take another year or two, but I am positive that the economic benefits will be profound in the coming years.  I agree with the Senator that we should continue investing in greenways, given that those that we have invested in have been good for the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#G00200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507042800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I concur with everything that the Minister of State said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1507042800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>That is great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#G00400","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507042800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>We have the most fantastic greenway.

Notwithstanding the point that Deputy Neville rightly makes about ensuring that the organisation operates efficiently, I will point to the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.

I am happy to speak about the importance of innovation and to outline to members some of the activities being delivered under the programme B expenditure area.  I am pleased that by comparison with the position at the start of 2016, an additional &euro;65 million has been invested in research and innovation through my Department.  This includes a supplementary allocation in late 2016.  Since I took up this portfolio, it has been clear to me that innovation has a key function in driving productivity growth, which is the most sustainable basis for improving Ireland's economic growth and overall living standards.  Innovation is central to Ireland's competitiveness and the ability of companies based in Ireland to compete internationally.<\/p> <p>  Key economic indicators show that firms which were not RDI-active suffered the greatest job losses during the recession, while innovation-active firms displayed higher resilience and growth in terms of rates of employment, exports and added value.  Pay levels in RDI-active firms are 10% ahead of the average.  Since 2006, the number of researchers working in the enterprise base has increased by 67% to over 17,800.  This indicates that there has been a major increase in knowledge transfer from public research to the private sector, which represents significant progress on a central innovation policy objective.<\/p> <p>  The strong science and innovation base we have built up over the past decade and a half has yielded results in terms of economic and societal impact.  When the European innovation scoreboard was published last June, I was pleased to note that Ireland was ranked first in the EU for SMEs innovating in-house and second for SMEs with product or process innovations.  We must continue to ensure, therefore, Ireland has the capabilities it needs to develop, grow and attract innovative enterprises.  Our investment in research and development and our highly-educated workforce is crucial to the development of an ecosystem from which success can emerge.<\/p> <p>  Investment in research and innovation through my Department is all about delivering tangible economic impacts.  In 2017, under programme B expenditure, approximately &euro;323 million will be invested in RDI programmes by my Department through its enterprise agencies, primarily Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Further investments are being made through the Tyndall National Institute, the European Space Agency and the programme for research in third level institutions.  I will highlight a few key achievements in the year to date.<\/p> <p>  Last month, we announced that &euro;72 million will be invested over the next six years in four new world-class Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, research centres.  Importantly, the new centres will be supported by 80 industry partners, which will provide &euro;38 million to support cutting-edge basic and applied research with strong industry engagement, economic and social impact.  This is an example of the collaboration between innovation, SFI, research and development and multinational companies, particularly in areas like pharmaceuticals and IT.  The four new centres will focus their research work on important areas like advanced manufacturing; identifying alternatives to finite fossil fuel resources and the treatment of chronic and rare neurological diseases.  The need to do research in these four important areas has been recognised across the world.  We are doing it here in Ireland.  Last month also saw the beginning of a &euro;43 million five-year investment in the SFI investigator programme, which sees funding go directly to leading researchers and their teams.  Projects receiving funding include work to develop new types of antibiotics and the development of magnetic materials for next-generation data processing.<\/p> <p>  We spoke earlier about Enterprise Ireland, which this year has continued to support research, development and innovation across our indigenous enterprise base.  Over 30 commercialisation fund projects have been approved already this year.  Equity investments have been made in 37 innovative high-potential start-ups.  Over 600 collaborative projects between Irish-based companies and Irish higher education institutes are supported through a range of initiatives such as innovation vouchers, innovation partnerships and technology gateway projects at our institutes of technology.<\/p> <p>  A new meat technology centre was established by Enterprise Ireland in conjunction with Teagasc earlier this year to create a strategic research and innovation base in beef and sheep meat processing for this country.  It brings to 14 the total number of technology centres that are supported by Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland.  I am pleased to note that over 600 companies are working within these technology centres.  This is phenomenal when taken as a percentage of the population.  Our extremely high level of investment in other countries is one of the highest across Europe.<\/p> <p>  The value of European Space Agency contracts secured by industry has reached &euro;5.47 million and is on track to reach its &euro;12 million target for this year.  Every &euro;1 we invest in the European Space Agency leads to a return of between &euro;6 and &euro;8.  The research and development work being done by the 62 companies across Ireland that are working within the agency are recognised across the world.  I refer to the work being done by scientists and people with PhDs.  Approximately &euro;424 million of Horizon 2020 funding has been won by our researchers, companies and research organisations to date.  While this positions us well to achieve our target of &euro;1.25 billion, we must not be complacent about that.  I am particularly pleased to note that over &euro;94 million of this funding has been awarded to small and medium-sized enterprises through the Horizon 2020 SME instrument.<\/p> <p>  The Tyndall National Institute, which is recognised all over the world, is one of our greatest research institutes.  It is the country's largest dedicated research centre.  It operates in the ICT sector which, as we know, is of huge economic importance.  At this point in the year, the institute is on track to deliver on its targets of &euro;6 million in income through engagement with industry, collaboration with over 200 companies and Horizon 2020 drawdown of &euro;7 million with 20 new projects funded.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has become a global innovation leader.  We must continue to invest in research, development and innovation if we are to secure a vibrant and strong economy over the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  We need a strong innovative enterprise base and growing employment, sales and exports.  We have to be internationally competitive.  I say that because as technology advances and drives industrial and economic growth in countries across Europe and the world over the next ten, 15 or 20 years, our scientists and researchers will have to be at the top in developing innovative projects.  I think we are there.  I will give a couple of examples in the area of research and development.  Ireland is ranked third in the world in agricultural science, which is phenomenal.  We are ranked first in the world in nanotechnology.  We are in the top ten in the world for innovative scientific projects and research.<\/p><p>Our record in research and development is recognised by countries such as Japan, Korea, right across Europe and by bodies from the European Space Agency to NASA in the US.

In regard to Irish membership of CERN, Innovation 2020 contains an action in this regard and we are already negotiating Ireland's membership options.  In January 2016, the then Minister of State with responsibility for skills, Deputy Damien English wrote to CERN in order to commence the process.  There have been ongoing discussions between my Department and CERN at both official and ministerial level throughout 2016 and 2017.  Officials from the Department, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland visited CERN in 2016.  The Director General of CERN visited Dublin and met my predecessor.<\/p> <p>  The information that has been gathered has provided my officials and me with a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits of CERN, however, the cost of membership is also significant. <\/p> <p>  The cost of Ireland becoming a full member of CERN is in the region of &euro;15 million per annum.  Alternatively, Ireland could become an associate member for 10% of that cost, that is &euro;1.5 million per annum.  An associate member enjoys reduced benefits, and reduced access to contracts and enterprise.  Based on the significant cost of joining CERN, and the European Southern Observatory, which I know that Sinn Fein and Fianna Fail Party are interested in, we are assessing the money that can be spent on this investment.  In my view, if it is possible, I think we should join CERN for the benefits that could accrue.  At present, the Department, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland are in discussions.  It would be wrong for me to say that we will have the financial wherewithal to do this straight away and join.  I know that Deputy Quinlivan has a great interest in Ireland joining CERN and I give him my word that when a decision will be made I will tell him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#J00400","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1507042800,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#J00500","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507042800,"counter":373,"content":"<p>As there are no further questions on programme B, we will proceed to programme C.

Since its establishment the Workplace Relations Commission through the new adjudication service has reduced the number of legacy employment rights industrial relations complaints.  The numbers have reduced from 2,397 in November 2015 to fewer than 50 at the end of June 2017.  That is a very striking reduction.  The number of equal status legacy cases has also been reduced from 1,298 to 482 cases.  I think that is really important.  In terms of handling current complaints the adjudication service received more than 6,000 specific complaints in the six months to the end of June 2017, but decisions in respect of complaints now issue within eight months, with the majority being issued within a shorter timeframe.  The service is responding in a faster way and in a much better timeframe than what users of the previous structures experienced.  Some 2,671 inspections have been completed to date this year, with a total of 1,000 employers found to have been in breach of the regulations.  <\/p> <p>  The figures for the Companies Registration Office Ireland, CRO, reflect the present economic situation.  The first half of 2017 was very busy for the CRO.  The number of Irish companies on the companies register is 211,110.  There were 2,713 external company registrations, and one can imagine the significant level of documentation, which was well over 250,000 documents, and some 74% were processed through e-filing but in excess of 11,000 new companies were incorporated, an average of 1,875 each month, and more than 13,000 new business names were registered with the CRO in the first half of this year.  That is a reflection of the economic activity that is going on in terms of businesses and companies.  It is very encouraging.  This level of new businesses being formed is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  The Low Pay Commission comes under my Department.  Deputies and Senators will be aware that in July 2017, the Low Pay Commission recommended a further increase in the national minimum wage of 30 cent, bringing the minimum wage up to &euro;9.55 per hour.  Responsibility was recently transferred to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection for that part of the work of my Department.<\/p> <p>  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, obviously plays a very central role in facilitating compliance with and enforcement of company law.  Again, let me put some statistics on the record, because I think they are very interesting, between 2012 and 2016, investigations by the ODCE have resulted in 977 company directors being restricted and 65 company directors disqualified by the High Court, with directors' loans infringements totalling &euro;221 million rectified on foot of action by the ODCE.  That is quite a volume of work.  However, following the outcome of the ODCE's prosecution of a number of persons, and Judge Alymer's decision in May 2017 to acquit Mr. Sean FitzPatrick, the then Minister at the time requested the Director of Corporate Enforcement to submit a report on the issues highlighted by Judge Aylmer in his ruling.  That report was furnished to me on 23 June 2017 under section 955 of the Companies Act 2014.  I have referred the report to the Attorney General for advice and specifically as to whether there are any legal impediments to publishing the report and discussing its contents in the Oireachtas.  Of course, I would like to publish the report and will do so as soon as I get legal clearance.<\/p> <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC is the other regulatory body charged with enforcing competition and consumer protection law.  They have done a great deal of work this year.  The first conviction in Ireland for bid rigging, resulted from an investigation into a cartel in the flooring sector.  The first custodial sentence was also handed down against a trader for misleading a consumer in the sale of a clocked car.  I think many will be interested to learn that the commission has been looking at misleading practices in the sale of clocked or crashed cars.  The CCPC continues an investigation into potential price signalling in the motor insurance sector as well.  The CCPC has held some 27 witness summons hearings and obtained more than 1.24 million emails and documents from parties under investigation into potential price signalling.  That is clearly a very serious and detailed investigation that is currently under way.<\/p><p>They are looking at anti-competitive conduct in the ticketing sector.  Some 99 files into potential car clocking in the motor industry were opened in the first half of the year and unannounced inspections commenced in car garages across the country to ensure compliance with consumer protection legislation.  In the year to date, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, has received 44 merger notifications, 41 of which were cleared within 30 working days.  That is a phase 1 assessment.  As at 30 June, in another important area on which it spends a lot of time, there were 114 live investigations into unsafe products on the market, which could include anything from dangerous toys to products that could cause harm in the home.  It is very centrally involved in that work as well.<\/p><p> I hope that gives a flavour of some of the agencies under the aegis of the Department at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#J00700","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507042800,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Before I invite the Deputies and Senators to ask their questions, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan has another meeting at 5.30 p.m. if he would like to be excused.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1507042800,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#K00300","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1507042800,"counter":378,"content":"<p>In respect of the  Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, I had occasion recently to meet the present director, Mr. Ian Drennan.

Those are very concerning statistics.  How many additional personnel has the HSA requested?  Has it requested additional funding for 2017?  Have other agencies or offices under the T&aacute;naiste's remit requested additional staff or funding?  If so, which agency and how many staff?<\/p> <p>   I also want to ask about the Workplace Relations Commission, if I may.  We had its officials in recently in respect of the fishing industry.  It was concerning to hear that they are going to have to step back on their inspection programme even though there are now charges of people trafficking, because they simply do not have the resources to cope.  How many labour inspectors are currently employed?  Would the T&aacute;naiste consider the case for increasing the number?  Sinn F&eacute;in carried out a survey of the hospitality industry which showed huge non-compliance with basic terms of employment and conditions.

There were two very tragic accidents at the time of the ploughing championships, as we know.  I visited the HSA stand at the ploughing championships and thought they were doing extraordinary work and getting huge attendances in terms of raising awareness and focusing on farm safety.

I met some of the families that are working with the HSA and have lost loved ones through farm accidents when I was at the ploughing.  They are doing excellent work in trying to increase awareness and I think we would all want to support that.<\/p> <p>  None of the new posts identified in the draft workforce plan relates to the farm safety inspectors, actually.  In respect of the farming sector, the draft workforce plan states that farming inspectors are resource-intensive and that the authority has actually developed new ways of engaging with farmers, such as the various farm walks and knowledge transfer groups.  They are approaching some of the work around farm safety in a different way, other than through straight inspection.  It is about engaging in these kind of events as well.  They have reported that this kind of engagement - I accept that inspections have a role - has the potential for a long-term impact with farmers, along with more targeted inspection campaigns.  <\/p> <p>  Senior officials from my Department are meeting Mr. O'Halloran tomorrow to discuss the HSA draft workforce plan.  The number of inspections did fall in recent years due to staff reductions and changes in the character of inspection activity, notably in the farm sector.  They have engaged in smarter work practices in order to ensure the message of improving workplace health and safety continues to reach the largest possible audiences.  The kind of initiatives they are taking include the development of the BeSMART online risk assessment tool, the publishing of e-learning courses in the agricultural area and the introduction of a programme of informative farm walks.  They have also updated the HSA's inspection data management system to increase the ease and efficiency of data entry through a simplified system and a new smartphone-based field inspection data app.<\/p> <p>  It is a bit like what we were saying about Enterprise Ireland.  They are finding new and sometimes more effective ways of working.  Most inspections are targeted at the high-risk sectors such as construction, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, mines, quarries, the transport of dangerous goods by road and the chemical sector.<\/p><p> Following the end of the moratorium on public service recruitment, my Department has given the HSA sanction to replace the number of inspection staff who left the HSA in 2016 and 2017.  The organisation is currently in the latter stages of recruiting 11 inspectors who, subject to the acceptance of contracts, etc. should be able to start work in quarter 4 of this year.

Obviously any initiative that can be brought forward to increase farm safety is very welcome.  A lot of the solution rests with education and a change of culture.  The initial research shows that there are different demographics of farmers and different risk categories.<\/p> <p>  The point made about inspections is very valid.  Let us remember that farm inspections cover a range of issues, including the environment and the rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  I urge that a co-ordinated approach is adopted for inspections.  There have been times, not in terms of farm safety, where farms are visited by a Department inspector and separately an inspector from the council where they contradict each other's findings.  That situation should be borne in mind in terms of more inspections.  I say that without detracting from the work of the HSA.  I support the call for greater health and safety but urge that inspections are co-ordinated to make it easier for farmers to carry on with their business.  Nowadays farming is a very demanding profession and often times farmers work in a solitary environment.  They do not have the amalgamation of a team around them yet they must manage all of the demands placed on them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#L00200","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507042800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Collins wish to comment again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1507042800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Yes, but on a different issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017100300002#L00400","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speech","time":1507042800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I was asked one other question that I did not answer.

Since it published its report in 2017, it has signed a memorandum of understanding, MOU, with other areas to support co-operation in terms of enforcement and information sharing.  I think that is very good.  It has also conducted an information and education campaign in the whitefish sector.  It has engaged with industry stakeholders to enhance compliance, training ten WRC inspectors at the National Fisheries Training College for deployment on fisheries inspection.  It has undertaken more than 200 inspections on the whitefish fleet involving 176 whitefish vessels over 15 m in length.  It has detected almost 200 contraventions relating to 110 vessels to the end of June 2017 and initiated five prosecutions where compliance by other means was not secured.
