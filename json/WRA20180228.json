Entitled Speak Up And Call It Out: Establishing a code of conduct for Irish theatre, the purpose of this event is to work towards the elimination of abuse of power and to safeguard the future health and wellbeing and career potential of those working in the sector by providing a code of conduct.\u00a0 A programme for the day will be announced on March 8th, International Women&rsquo;s Day. <\/p>  <p>  I hope that the output from the conference can be incorporated into existing measures in the not-for-profit sector while also considering if there are additional measures that can be taken for those who operate outside any organised structure.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the wider cultural sector, my Department will be organising governance workshops for the organisations that come under\u00a0my direct remit.\u00a0 The Department is also\u00a0liaising with the Arts Council in relation to the provision of similar training\u00a0to all other cultural organisations and arts\u00a0centres\u00a0around the country through a series of regional information\u00a0days. <\/p>  <p>  There has to be a clear message accepted universally that a culture of dignity and respect at work is expected as a basic human right everywhere, regardless of the workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800028#WRC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800028#WRC03000"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[10096\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800028#WRC03100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the projected spending increase for her Department under the national development plan in 2018, 2019 and 2020.","asker":"1235","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>Project Ireland 2040 &ndash; the National Planning Framework and associated 10 year National Development Plan &ndash; explicitly recognises that our culture, language and heritage are an essential part of the sustainable development of the country.\u00a0 This acknowledgement of the centrality of our culture and creativity, of our language and community and of our built and natural heritage to our national development is unprecedented in this type of planning framework.<\/p><p>Project Ireland has made provision for a &euro;1 billion investment in our culture and heritage over the 10 years of the plan.\u00a0 This is in addition to an investment of &euro;178 million in the Irish language and in our Gaeltacht and Island communities.\u00a0 This investment will be delivered, as follows, over the next three years:<\/p><p>-&euro;54 million in 2018;<\/p><p>-&euro;75 million in 2019; and<\/p><p>-&euro;76 million in 2020.<\/p><p>My Department has also been advised that the allocations for 2021 and 2022 will be &euro;80 million and &euro;110 million, more than double the 2018 allocation,\u00a0respectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800028#WRC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maoini&uacute; d'Eagrais Ghaeilge","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800028#WRC03300"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[10095\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800028#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute;n m&eacute;ad&uacute; at&aacute; i gceist leis an m&eacute;ad&uacute; at&aacute; luaite i dTionscadal 2040 ar chaiteachas &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus Fhoras na Gaeilge sa todhcha&iacute;; cathain go d&iacute;reach a dh&eacute;anfar &eacute; seo; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.

During the height of the financial crisis\u00a0a key focus of the authorities was on stabilising and ultimately reducing mortgage arrears through the implementation of sustainable\u00a0mortgage solutions that were agreed with borrowers. <\/p><p>This led to the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) introducing public mortgage arrears resolution targets (MART) for the banks in H1 2013.  As the MART process was rolled out a split mortgage solution or\u00a0a part capital and interest solution that met certain criteria were accepted by the CBI as being sustainable for the purposes of these targets.  <\/p><p>Following the successful achievement of these targets by each of the banks, and since the implementation of the SSM in November 2014, the focus has shifted from the question of mortgage arrears levels and banks' progress in restructuring loans. In fact regulatory attitudes have not only hardened but have changed.  This shift in focus has been accompanied by a new strict definition of what constitutes an NPL. \u00a0<\/p><p>Officials in my Department met with staff of the SSM at the highest level on two occasions since late 2016 and discussed NPLs.  In the course of their discussions they outlined the background and history to the restructuring effort in Ireland and questioned the logic of now classifying some types of restructured loans as NPL, and not just for a short probationary period\u00a0but indefinitely. <\/p><p>While my Department has been informed that the SSM is looking into the regulatory treatment of split mortgages across a number of European member states I have no evidence at this point that this categorisation is going to change.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Aside from direct interaction with the SSM, Department officials have also been actively involved in the discussions on NPLs through its involvement in the European Council&rsquo;s Financial Services Committee subgroup on NPLs, and the more recent European\u00a0Commission Expert Group on NPLs.  While this has\u00a0ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s views are voiced and considered on the matter, ultimately the final arbiter on the resolution of problem loans is the SSM.<\/p><p>The CBI has provided me with the following comment in relation to the Deputy's question:<\/p><p>&quot;In 2014, the European Banking Authority (EBA) introduced harmonized definitions of forbearance and non-performing exposures for supervisory reporting purposes (referred to as the ).  The definitions provide supervisors of European banks with comparable measures of asset quality and forbearance activities.  Banks are required to submit reporting templates (via FINREP) detailing their level of non-performing and forborne exposures in line with the EBA&rsquo;s definitions. <\/p><p>Paragraph 145 of the EBA&rsquo;s ITS on forbearance and non-performing exposures provides the definition of non-performing while paragraph 163 defines forbearance.  Exposures should be classified as non-performing and\/or forborne if they meet the relevant criteria outlined in the ITS.  In relation to curing, paragraph 157 outlines the criteria required for a non-performing forborne exposure to move back to performing status.<\/p><p>Furthermore, in March 2017 the SSM published &ldquo;&rdquo; which sets out supervisory expectation regarding NPL identification, management, measurement and write-offs.  Information on the requirements to cure\/exit from non-performing status is also provided, which utilises the ITS noted above. <\/p><p>Therefore, restructured NPLs can migrate back to performing when the criteria outlined in the EBA ITS has been satisfied, and it is the bank&rsquo;s responsibility to conduct that assessment.  Depending on the specificities of the restructure, it can take at least a year for a restructured NPL to move back to performing status.  Restructured NPLs successfully moving back to performing status is one of the important factors in improvements in mortgage NPL levels in recent years.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800030#WRE03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800030#WRE04000"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[10420\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800030#WRE04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the charging of VAT on rental income in cases (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>I am advised by The\u00a0Revenue Commissioners\u00a0that it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the information provided by the Deputy.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I would point out that the letting of immovable goods is exempt from VAT in accordance with the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

Many pupils with special educational needs will be able to attend a local mainstream school, whereas for pupils who have needs which require more specialist interventions, special class and special school placements are provided for. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required and for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.\u00a0 The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The NCSE welcomes expressions of interest from schools in opening special classes to meet the demand for special class provision. \u00a0In deciding on the location of a special class SENOs take into account both the present and the future potential need for special class provision and they must be satisfied that the special class is sustainable and appropriately located. \u00a0SENOs liaise with relevant professionals in their area to arrive at an informed decision.<\/p><p>The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary, subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.\u00a0 All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.

The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the changes\u00a0I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher\u00a0is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.<\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.

The ISI&rsquo;s mission is, by operating the statutory framework for personal insolvency solutions, to return insolvent people to solvency and full participation in social and economic activity.<\/p><p>The Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) does not record information in relation to each individual financial institution.  However, the ISI issues quarterly statistics setting out the number of personal insolvency arrangements and the acceptance level by creditors in aggregate.  These statistics are published on the ISI website .  The specific data requested by the Deputy is not available in tabular form<\/p><p>I can inform the Deputy that, to date, the ISI has returned over 6,000 debtors to solvency with over 2,000 of those cases being Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) which deal with mortgage debt.  In over 90% of these PIA cases, debtors have been able to stay in their homes.<\/p><p>The solutions introduced in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 have also had an indirect impact on the number and quality of over 120,000 informal agreements between debtors and creditors, as reported by the Central Bank of Ireland. Because arrangements agreed under the Act are public and court approved, they set precedents for the terms of agreements that will be acceptable to a court.  Debtors now have realistic alternative options available to them through the ISI if negotiations break down.<\/p><p>The Section 115A court review process, introduced with effect from November 2015, permits a debtor to ask the court to review and assess the reasonableness of a Personal Insolvency Arrangement proposal which has been refused by creditors, and which includes mortgage arrears on the debtor's home.<\/p><p>Currently, there are over 500 such cases before the courts.  I am advised that a significant High Court judgment in early February addressed two key issues that had become a logjam in the process.  Namely, technical issues around the application for a court review and a fear from personal insolvency practitioners that creditors might pursue them for costs in a personal capacity.  I understand that these issues have now been adequately addressed.  The judgment has been positively received by both the Insolvency Service of Ireland and Personal Insolvency Practitioners.  Subject to any possible appeal, it is expected the judgment will lead to increased activity in Personal Insolvency Arrangements.<\/p><p>I can also advise the Deputy that Abhaile, the Government's national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, ensures that people who are in danger of losing their home have access to free professional advice, including advice from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner.  As of 23 February 2018, 8354 vouchers for professional financial advice and help on home mortgage arrears from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner have been issued through Abhaile.  Additionally, a borrower may apply for legal aid to the Legal Aid Board to seek a court review under section 115A where their proposed Personal Insolvency Arrangement had been rejected by the creditors.  Up to 23 February, legal aid had been approved under the Abhaile scheme for 607 such reviews brought under the personal insolvency legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800032#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Offences Data","counter":286,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800032#WRG04100"},{"type":"question","counter":287,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[10341\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800032#WRG04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of drug driving arrests made by county in the south eastern Garda division in the past four years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":288,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the statistics sought by the Deputy and I will be in contact with the Deputy directly on receipt of a Garda report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800032#WRG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service Data","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800032#WRG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[10342\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800032#WRG04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the cost of providing free legal aid and free civil aid over the past seven years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the provision of legal aid falls within two separate categories, that is, civil legal aid and criminal legal aid.

I am very much committed to exploring mechanisms to encourage more individuals to switch to electric vehicles (EVs).  In fact, in the National Policy Framework for Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland 2017-2030 published last year by my Department, we set a clear ambition that all new cars and vans sold in Ireland from 2030 onwards will be zero emission (or zero emission-capable).  (Available at<i><\/i>.  This ambition was reiterated in both the Government's National Mitigation Plan () and the recent National Development Plan 2018-2027 ().<\/p><p>In this regard, it may interest the Deputy to know that my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, jointly convened an interdepartmental Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEV) Task Force to consider a wide range of measures and options available to Government for the purpose of accelerating the deployment of low carbon technologies &ndash; specifically that of EVs.  The work of the Taskforce has been divided into three work streams focusing on: Market Growth Stimuli and Visibility (Working Group 1); Infrastructure, Energy Regulation and Pricing (Working Group 2); and Planning Legislation, Building Regulations and Public Leadership (Working Group 3).  Preliminary recommendations from the Taskforce were considered in the 2018 budgetary process and a suite of continued and new EV supports were subsequently announced.  A list of current incentives to promote EVs is presented in the table below and is promoted on the SEAI website ().  As you will see there is a particular focus on raising public awareness and promoting citizen engagement with EVs. <\/p><p>In terms of the number and location of publicly accessible charging stations, I understand that there are currently c. 1,200 charge points (79 fast chargers) available across the island of Ireland which is among the more comprehensive networks currently in place across Europe.  At present the fast charge points are primarily located on corridors that facilitate intercity travel.  However, during 2018 Working Groups 2 and 3 of the Taskforce will comprehensively consider the future development of the EV charging network as a key element to support greater EV use.  In relation to dedicated parking for EVs, under the Road Traffic Act 1994 it is a matter for each individual local authority to make bye-laws governing the type of paid parking controls in their jurisdictions.  However, the role of parking as an incentive is currently under consideration by Working Group 1 of the Taskforce and a series of stakeholder engagements with local authorities have already taken place.  The LEV Taskforce expects toreport its findings to Government in Q2 2018.<\/p><p>Finally, I was delighted to secure funding as part of Budget 2018 to help encourage the transition of our Taxi\/Hackney\/Limousine sector towards EVs.  This sector can play a vital role in championing the use of EVs to members of the public and in reducing harmful tailpipe emissions, particularly across our urban areas.  The grant scheme was launched on February 1st and is administered on behalf of my Department by the National Transport Authority (NTA). This scheme is available nationwide and supports both new and second-hand EVs. <\/p><p>Current Electric Vehicle Incentives<table><tr><th>Current Incentives<\/th><th>-<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>VRT Relief<\/td><td>Continuation of VRT relief in Budget 2018 -<br \/><br \/>Up to &euro;5,000 for new EVs until end 2021   <br \/><br \/>Up to &euro;2,500 for new PHEVs until end 2018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SEAI Grant Scheme<\/td><td>Continuation of SEAI Purchase Grant -  <br \/><br \/>Up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new EV or PHEV<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA)<\/td><td>EVs and charging infrastructure are qualifying equipment under the ACA scheme<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Charging Supports<\/td><td>A new grant to support installation of home charger points for buyers of new and second-hand EVs from January 1st<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SPSV Grant Scheme<\/td><td>A new grant and supporting measures to stimulate take-up of EVs in the taxi \/hackney\/limousine sector<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>0% Benefit-in-Kind (BIK)<\/td><td>A new BIK 0% rate to incentivise EVs without mileage conditions for at least three years<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Public Body Procurement<\/td><td>National Procurement Service to introduce a new public procurement framework contract for EVs in 2018 to allow public bodies to buy EVs with reduced administrative burden<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Public Engagement Programme<\/td><td>National awareness campaign  <br \/><br \/>Driver experience roadshow  <br \/><br \/>Public sector and commercial fleet trials  <br \/><br \/>Support for EV use in car sharing trials<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Toll Incentive Regime<\/td><td>A reduced tolling regime for EVs is expected to be introduced in 2018. <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800035#WRK05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety Authority Data","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800036#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[10313\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800036#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will report on the Road Safety Authority Strategy 2013 to 2020, page 24 (details supplied); the way in which data collection has been improved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":511,"content":"<p>This is a matter for the Road Safety Authority.

As outlined in the recently published 'National Development Plan 2018-2027, Project Ireland 2040' (NDP), the DART Expansion Programme is a series of projects that will create a full metropolitan area DART Network? for Dublin with all of the lines linked and connected over the period of the plan.  <\/p>  <p>  The initial sequencing of investment under the NDP will focus on delivery of non-underground tunnel elements of the Programme using the recently opened rail link and existing connector tunnel under the Phoenix Park (which has provided the option for Kildare commuters to access the city centre stations of Connolly, Tara Street and Pearse).  This sequencing and focus includes buying additional fleet for the DART network and measures such as re-signalling, junction and station changes to provide expanded services.  The next step will be to provide fast, high-frequency electrified services to Drogheda on the Northern Line, Celbridge\/Hazelhatch on the Kildare Line, Maynooth and M3 Parkway on the Maynooth\/Sligo Line, while continuing to provide DART services on the South-Eastern Line as far south as Greystones.  It will also include new stations to provide interchange with bus, LUAS and Metro networks.<\/p>  <p>  The significant benefit to using the recently opened rail link and existing connector tunnel under the Phoenix Park and the proposed sequence of investment, is that it will enable additional passenger services to be put in place much earlier using existing infrastructure with some enhancements.  This integrated rail network will provide a core, high-capacity transit system for the region and will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Maynooth and Celbridge\/Hazelhatch as well as Drogheda and Greystones.  The route for the remaining element of the overall DART Expansion Programme, the DART Underground Tunnel, will be established and protected to allow for its future delivery.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputies' questions to the Authority for further information on the issues raised.

Tusla indicate that this may includes checking with professionals who see the child regularly, or visiting the child and family at home<b>,<\/b>getting additional information about the child's situation and, in some instances where a child is in care, organising a Care Plan Review and visiting the child. <\/p><p>Information about unallocated cases is published monthly on the Tusla website. The most up to date data available is for November 2017.  I can inform the Deputy that there were 24,445 open cases nationally at the end of November. Of these, 4,760 were awaiting allocation of a social worker. This information is provided in the table below, in the format requested by the Deputy. Tusla have experienced an increase of referrals to child protection and welfare services. There were 4,651 referrals received in November 2017, an increase of 749 (19%) on the same period in 2016.  <\/p><p>I, and my officials, will continue to engage directly with the Tusla Board and Senior Management Team to monitor and  review progress.<\/p><p>Cases open to Tusla social work awaiting allocation to a social worker, by Tusla Area<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Tusla Area <\/th><th>Number of cases awaiting allocation to a social worker <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin South East\/Wicklow <\/td><td>105 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin South West\/Kildare\/West Wicklow <\/td><td>805 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin South Central <\/td><td>233 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Midlands <\/td><td>241 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin North City <\/td><td>369 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin North <\/td><td>462 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth\/Meath <\/td><td>240 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan\/Monaghan <\/td><td>234 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry <\/td><td>107 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork <\/td><td>605 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow\/Kilkenny\/South Tipperary <\/td><td>255 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford\/Wexford <\/td><td>232 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal <\/td><td>467 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo\/Leitrim\/West Cavan <\/td><td>64 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo <\/td><td>0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway\/Roscommon <\/td><td>185 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Midwest <\/td><td>156 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Cases<\/td><td>4,760<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800036#WRL02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800036#WRL02800"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[10252\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022800036#WRL02900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if the qualifications of a special needs assistant can be accepted for the early years childcare programme action and inclusion model;

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. <\/p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.

From October 2013 onwards, the payment of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for fuel allowance.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 904,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;90 million.  <\/p><p>The scheme is available to all people aged over 66 living permanently in the State.  To qualify for the scheme, applicants who are under age 66 must be in receipt of a qualifying payment.  These are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.  <\/p><p>A companion free travel pass entitles the pass holder to have any one person, aged 16 years or over, to accompany him\/her free of charge when travelling.  In addition to this, people in receipt of carers allowance or benefit from my Department are also entitled to a free travel pass in their own right.  Therefore if the person being cared for has a companion travel pass they can nominate a person other than the carer to travel with them and the carer may travel on the single free travel pass they have received.<\/p><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. <\/p><p>There are no plans at this time to increase the number of free travel companions that may travel without charge under the scheme.

The scheme supports heritage projects across the country and creates employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas, and is co-ordinated by each local authority. \u00a0\u00a0My Department has allocated &euro;2m under the Built Heritage Investment Scheme 2018, of which &euro;50,000 is the indicative amount for County Kildare. <\/p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.\u00a0 Local authorities have submitted applications to my Department and they will shortly be assessed by an expert panel. Successful applicants will be notified by their local authority shortly thereafter. My Department has allocated &euro;1,324,000 under the Structures at Risk Fund 2018. While there is no specific allocation for each local authority, I can confirm that applications have been received in respect of County Kildare. <\/p>  <p>  Receipt of applications for both the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and Structures at Risk Fund are now closed, however on-going queries can be addressed to all respective local authorities who are implementing both schemes throughout 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage is a state initiative to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 built heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently as an aid to its protection and conservation. The NIAH building surveys provide the basis for my recommendations, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, to the planning authorities for the inclusion of particular structures in their Record of Protected Structures. The published surveys are a source of information on the selected structures for relevant planning authorities.\u00a0 They are also a research and educational resource. <\/p>  <p>  Through the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), my Department manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 87,000 hectares.
