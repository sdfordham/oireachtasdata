However, I draw her attention to the record of her Government in respect of payment of the grant.  Of the three budgets the Government has introduced, the minor works grant was paid in only one, last year's budget.  The Minister outlined the rates.  This has left a huge hole in the budget of every primary school in the country.  The burden has fallen back on cash-strapped families.  Let us consider this with the fact the summer works scheme was not paid for two of the past three years and that each of these three years saw reductions in capitation allocations to schools.  Let us consider also the actions of the Minister's Cabinet colleague and now party leader, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, in halving the back-to-school payment for secondary school students and cutting by one third the back-to-school payment for primary school students.  All in all, the Government has taken in excess of &euro;100 million per year from supports to schools and families of schoolchildren.  This funding must be raised by families who are among the most hard-pressed in the country in recent years.  This is an unacceptable increase for families in the cost of sending children to school.  I emphasise the importance of trying to relieve that pressure and the need to change the approach by delivering a decision in the budget next week which will see that payment given to every school in the coming year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800005#C01100","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1412758200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>As the Deputy well knows, difficult decisions have had to be made in all Departments in recent years because of the economic collapse and specific agreements on the level of cuts each Department has had to take.

It is important that a different approach be taken during the coming months than the one we have seen to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800009#G01000","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1412760600,"counter":127,"content":"<p>In making the decision to move forward, I must take the interests of all partners into account, not just the teachers'.

The first ever performance report on the higher education system was published this year.  Despite the challenges faced by third level colleges, it showed that the system was performing well.  Having established a baseline performance, we will now be able to track whether the system gets better or worse on an annual basis.  Overall, it is important to note that every university in Ireland ranks in the top 600 universities across each of the league tables, putting all of our universities in the top 5% of universities across the world.<\/p><p>  Regarding the 1% reduction, this is already part of the budgetary figure for 2015 that was published in 2014.

Last week, Trinity College, Dublin, fell out of the THE's top 100 and UCD fell out of its top 200.  This has implications for the standing of our education in international eyes and for attracting investment.  It also has implications for the quality of education provided to students.  This is no surprise given the consistent reduction in funding for the third level sector in the past number of years.  The Government has continually put off making a decision on how to ensure adequate funding so as to prevent a further slide in the rankings.  The CEO of the Higher Education Authority, Mr. Tom Boland, suggested that the Government's planned &euro;250 increase in the student registration fee should this year be left with the institutions to which it is paid.<\/p><p>Can the Minister of State revert to me with a reply as to whether the Government will agree to do that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800009#G01700","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412761200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I again thank Deputy McConalogue for his comments at the outset.  To work back through his questions, I naturally cannot answer his last question, as the Government is in the middle of a budgetary process for the next week or two and consequently, I cannot go into that at present.  To clarify the positions and rankings of the universities, the QS World University Rankings show that seven universities in Ireland feature in the top 200.  That is the top 1% out of 15,000 universities across the world and one should put this into perspective.  As for the Times Higher Education rankings, Trinity College has lost ground slightly and has dropped from 129th to 138th place.  UCD has slipped considerably from 161st to 220th place but NUIG has greatly improved its position.  I note NUI Maynooth also has dropped slightly, while UCC has remained within the top 300.  On being prone to exaggeration, the Deputy is correct that there are different league tables, all of which are assessed slightly differently.  Overall, however, one should bear in mind that one is talking about the top 1% out of 15,000 universities.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is correct to state that funding has been cut.  I will not explain to him why that has happened, as I believe he is aware how we got here.  While there have been cuts in funding in recent years, the Government will attempt to close that gap as things improve.  The Deputy also referred to the Government delaying the decision.  As he is aware, the expert working group on this area, chaired by Peter Cassells, is currently preparing the report on the future of funding policy for higher education.  That group is due to make its internal report to the Government and to the Department by the end of 2014.

There has been significant pressure on them, which has been reflected in a number of slides in the rankings recently, particularly by UCD and Trinity College, which while marginal, definitely constitute a reduction.  There is no doubt but that this reduction goes back to funding levels.  Over the past three years, the Government has introduced each year an increase of &euro;250 in the student registration fee.  Despite increasing this charge to students, that money has not been left within the system, as the amount of money being given to the third level system has been reduced at the same time.  This cannot continue without leading to a reduction in the quality at third level.

To clarify, however, the amount allocated last year through the Higher Education Authority for this area was &euro;939 million, while in 2013 it was just over &euro;1 billion.  While I acknowledge there undoubtedly has been a slight reduction in this regard, the Deputy might understand this if I point it out the reason.  When the present Government came into office three years ago, it was &euro;20 billion short of the sum it needed to run the country.  One should be clear on this point, as this shortfall of &euro;20 billion was not of the Government's doing but was the position it inherited.  It has been obliged to try to make sure that in the meantime, while the country recovers, it spends the money it has as best it can.  Moreover, the Government has targeted it as best it can towards education and in most areas, it has protected the funding to education.  To be clear, however, the Deputy has quoted tables and has stated the universities are slipping down while still trying to state they are doing well.  They are doing extremely well, compared with the 15,000 universities against which they are competing throughout the world.  The Government's own reports and evaluations suggest that in general, industry sources - an important viewpoint - are very satisfied with what is coming through the education system and the universities.  Their graduates are employment-ready and are succeeding very well as graduates in employment.  This also is how one judges the success of an education system within a recovering economy in which one also is trying to build an enterprise-driven economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800010#H00800","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1412761200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>The Deputy is not present for Question No. 13.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800010#H00900","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412761200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Question No. 13 replied to with Written Answers.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Review","time":1412761200,"counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800010#H01050"},{"type":"question","time":1412761200,"counter":145,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[37959\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800010#H01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the value for money report on small schools will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1412761200,"counter":146,"content":"<p>This is to ask the Minister when the value for money report on small schools will be published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800010#H01200","answer":true,"speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1412761200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>As I indicated earlier, I am reviewing the value for money report for small schools along with my Government colleagues.

It is a great example of public service reform, one of the developments that many people have sought to deliver, to examine systems that perhaps are not performing to the standard that they should and reform them to bring something that would be best in class.  That is what we are on the road to do.  It is a tribute to many people who have worked tirelessly to bring this to the point where it is and I pay tribute to all of those involved.<\/p><p>  The system that was in place when we started this process and when I came into office first had become far too complex, far too hard to use and too legalistic.  It resulted in long delays for people.  It was frustrating for people within the system to work.  Essentially, many committed people were trapped in a process that was letting them down.  There was a universal desire for a change to be made but that did not mean that the road of change would be easy.  Clearly, integrating multiple different systems, even at the ICT level, is challenging but in every way it is challenging and I refer to the processes, the forms and the approach.  It has involved considerable work to get this right.  While I get the opportunity to present this Bill a huge amount of work has gone on.  The Bill is the tip of the iceberg one sees over the surface of the water but much of the underpinning of it is attributable to many people who have made it work.<\/p><p>  What we have produced here, and I hope this is what it proves to be in practice, is something where the obligations of both sides in the workplace are easily understood.  It fosters a compliance culture in the workplace whereby people recognise that performing to high standards, delivering to the best of those standards and meeting legal obligations is part of running a good business and working in a good enterprise.  It builds on our strong voluntarist tradition that has been a great stand-by to us in terms of managing industrial relations over a long period.  It will allow complaints, and complaints arrive even in the best of systems, to be dealt with at the earliest and most effective point in the process.  It will also ensure that where there are those who will not meet their obligations, there is effective enforcement and that the enforcement can deliver to the people who have been the victims of wrong practices.  A good deal of work must be put in to make those different steps in the chain be effective.<\/p><p>  That is the backdrop to this legislation.  It is legislation that will remove the deficiencies we saw, which cause complexities for practitioners and users of the service.  They included multiple points of entry to the system, forum shopping, long delays in scheduling hearings and issuing decisions.  Key to addressing those is what we are doing in this Bill, which will see the existing five State bodies replaced by two.  The Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal, the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT, and the first instance functions of the Labour Court will be replaced by the new workplace relations commission, WRC, and the appellate functions of the EAT will be transferred to a new expanded Labour Court.  We will have a much simpler structure in place.<\/p><p>  My objective is to deliver a world-class workplace relations service providing an integrated industrial relations, adjudication and enforcement service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost-effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.  From an industrial relations point of view, Ireland operates a voluntarist system of collective bargaining comprising non-intervention by the State in disputes but the State does provide dispute settling institutions and frameworks for local level and sectoral wage settling.  I am satisfied that the State's industrial relations machinery has worked very successfully and effectively over the years and it is for this reason that it has not been necessary to make any significant changes in this Bill in terms of the manner in which this system operates.  The functions of the WRC will comprise all those currently undertaken by the Labour Relations Commission, including industrial relations conciliation, advisory services, information and research.  These services, as currently operated by the Labour Relations Commission, have made a magnificent contribution to the industrial relations environment and will be incorporated into the WRC without change.  We are privileged to have such an amount of experience and knowledge in managing extremely difficult industrial relations situations and we have seen many of them even during my term in office.  Even the most intractable have been capable of being managed by the sort of experience and commitment we have in those services.<\/p><p>  During the preparatory stage of this legislation we have had quite extensive consultation.  We had extensive public consultation exercises and published two policy papers, which have helped to improve, redesign and deliver the best we can make in terms of this legislation.  There was a strong consensus right across the system that reform was timely and necessary.  That was very encouraging and it helped to deliver this Bill.  We have had many meetings with interested parties, representatives of both sides, the employees, employers, equality interests, including IBEC and ICTU, to get their input into the process.  Like any consultation exercise, not everyone will be happy with every aspect, but we have tried to understand the spirit of people's comment and make sure that we have incorporated those as best we can into the legislation that has been developed. \t<\/p><p>  In advance of the legislation, officials in my Department have been working on the process, technology, staffing and administrative matters required to underpin the reform programme and make it easier for users to do business.  This goes back to January 2012, although it is not that everything has been waiting for this Bill but this is a very important final piece in the building structure.  There has been a single reception and registration of complaints on behalf of the five workplace relations bodies by a single portal, known as the workplace relations customer services.  It was complemented by a single complaints form; there had been 30 separate forms but now there is only one and it became an e-complaint form from September 2013.  Complaints are now acknowledged and the respondent is notified within three working days.  People who have a complaint made against them will know that within three working days.  In the worst of cases it had been taking up to 80 days in the past.  This gives the employers, who usually are those complained of, the opportunity to engage at an early stage with a view to resolving the issue.  The earlier people understand the challenge that is made, the quicker a solution can be got if there is goodwill. <\/p><p>  The post-registration functions associated with complaints management, including the scheduling of adjudication hearings, are from this month being managed by another shared services unit.  We have also established an early resolution service, which has enabled complaints and disputes to be dealt with as close to the workplace as possible.  There is no point in having every complaint simply swept along to a hearing if it can be managed at an earlier point.  As soon as possible after receipt, registration and validation, this early resolution service is available and mediation is also available which builds on the experience of the Equality Tribunal, which had a track record in operating mediation, and we have incorporated that learning into the Bill.<\/p><p>  In terms of savings, people will always look at not only the improved service we are delivering but whether savings are possible.  I am glad to say that there will be fewer staff numbers required to deliver the new service.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>It is estimated that annual savings due to staff reductions and efficiencies will amount to approximately &euro;2 million.  The main drivers of the reduction in staff costs will be the centralisation of administration and case management services and the automation of business processes.<\/p><p> Before I outline in detail the main provisions in the Bill, I will outline the key measures that will be provided for in the legislation.  The services of the Equality Tribunal, National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT, will come together under the remit of the WRC.  It will be the first port of call.  The appellate functions of the EAT will be amalgamated into a single reconfigured Labour Court, which will be the appellate body for all matters.  The Bill will establish the Office of Director General of the WRC, the appointment of the director general by the Minister on specified terms of appointment, and the statutory powers and functions of the director general.  It will establish the WRC board with responsibility for strategy and annual work programme.  It will transfer the existing functions provided by the LRC, including conciliation, workplace mediation and advisory services, to the WRC.  It will provide for workplace relations information and advisory services.  To encourage the compliance culture we need, it is crucial that we understand not only the information, but also the body of decisions that the courts have made over the period, which is a very important source of information and understanding.<\/p><p> The Bill will provide a statutory basis for the use of innovative measures such as compliance notices and fixed charge notices to enhance the compliance functions of the WRC.  These are tried and tested approaches that speed up and encourage a compliance culture rather than the &quot;gotcha&quot; culture of finally catching and prosecuting people.  It has been shown in other areas that this builds a compliance culture and it is correct to bring it into such legislation.  The Bill will introduce the sharing of employment related and other specified information between the WRC, Labour Court and other official agencies in the context of promoting compliance with employment legislation.  It is important that a body of decision precedent is built up as it is an important element of delivering a quality service.  The Bill provides for the appointment of additional members to the Labour Court to facilitate the increased workload of the court in the new system.  It provides for a more transparent system of appointment of adjudicators of the WRC and chairmen, vice chairmen and ordinary members to the Labour Court.  It will standardise certain procedural matters such as limitation periods, the length of the period within which a first instance adjudicator's decision may be appealed, etc., across the full range of employment rights legislation.  Thus all pieces will work to the same standard.  It will ensure better enforcement of employment rights awards and better compliance and enforcement measures for employment rights.<\/p><p> The Bill consists of seven Parts comprising 82 sections and 6 Schedules.  For the convenience of Deputies, a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published and it provides a synopsis of the provisions.  Part 1 comprises sections 1 to 7 of the Bill.  Sections 1 to 5 contain the Short Title, collective citation, commencement provisions, interpretation and measures relating to the service of documents.  Section 6 outlines the penalties which will apply when a person is found guilty of an offence under this Bill.  Section 7 refers to Schedule 2 which details the provisions repealed by this Bill and makes transitional arrangements for complaints or disputes referred to a rights commissioner before the commencement of Part 4.<\/p><p> Part 2 comprises sections 8 to 24 and makes provision for the establishment of the WRC.  The LRC, NERA, Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the EAT would be replaced by the new WRC and the appeals functions of the EAT would be incorporated into the Labour Court.  Sections 8 and 9 make provision for the establishment day of the new WRC.  Section 10 sets out general functions of the WRC that are additional to other functions conferred on it by specific sections by the Act.  The WRC will be tasked with taking positive steps to ensure high standards of compliance with employment legislation and equally high standards in the conduct of industrial relations generally and with the provision of the necessary services to facilitate the speedy resolution of industrial relations disputes at as early a stage as possible.  Simultaneously, the WRC will have responsibility for providing the means whereby complaints under employment rights legislation can be investigated, resolved by early intervention or adjudicated, as appropriate, by competent personnel.  Where the WRC suspects continued non-compliance with employment legislation on the part of workers or employers, it may resort to prosecution of the parties in question.  The functions of the WRC will comprise all those currently undertaken by the LRC, including industrial relations conciliation, advisory services, information and research.  The WRC adjudication service will continue the dispute resolution role of the rights commissioners as provided for in the Industrial Relations Act 1969 as well as employment rights adjudication functions.<\/p><p> Sections 11 to 15 make provision for the appointment, resignation or removal from office and functions of the director general of the WRC.  The director general of the WRC will be appointed by the Minister following the holding of an open competition by the Public Appointments Service other than in the case of the first appointee to the office of director general.  The Accounting Officer for the commission will be the Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Section 16 makes provision, on standard lines, that the director general is accountable to committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas, other than the Committee of Public Accounts.  Section 19 provides that the commission shall have a statutory basis, in consultation with the Minister, for the preparation and publication of codes of practice for the improvement generally of workplace relations.  Section 20 provides for the regular production of a strategy statement by the board of the WRC to be approved by the Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 21 provides that the board shall prepare an annual work programme in consultation with the director general for submission to the Minister.  Section 22 requires, on standard lines, the director general of the commission to make an annual report to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Section 24 provides for the appointment of a qualified and experienced lawyer to act as registrar to the commission.<\/p><p> Part 3 comprises sections 25 to 35 and makes provision for the compliance procedures that will be introduced under the new workplace relations structures.  The functions undertaken by NERA to date in promoting a culture of compliance with employment legislation will be continued by the compliance service of the new WRC.  However, new mechanisms such as compliance notices and fixed charge penalties will supplement the existing statutory powers of labour or NERA inspectors.  Sections 25 and 26 restate and consolidate in one location the powers of inspectors which are at present provided for under a range of individual enactments.<\/p><p> Section 27 makes provision for the use of compliance notices to promote higher levels of compliance with employment legislation.  Such notices may issue when an inspector forms an opinion that a scheduled contravention of employment law, which the employer concerned fails or refuses to rectify, has occurred.  The compliance notice will set out the steps the employer concerned must take to effect compliance.  An employer may appeal against all or any aspect of the notice to the Labour Court.  The Labour Court, following a hearing upon appeal, shall affirm the compliance notice, withdraw the compliance notice or withdraw the compliance notice and require the employer to whom the notice applies to comply with such directions as may be given by the Labour Court.  This section also makes provision for an appeal of the Labour Court decision to the Circuit Court.  Failure to comply with a compliance notice may result in the Circuit Court, following a hearing, issuing a binding order.  Failure to comply with such an order of the Circuit Court would be a prosecutable offence.  This will give a more effective route to prosecution and enforcement.<\/p><p> Section 28 is intended to remove any doubt about the admissibility of the written report of an inspector in any proceedings under employment legislation to which the employer whose records are the subject of the report is a party.  Section 30 will allow the WRC and its inspectors and adjudication officers to share certain employment-related information with other statutory enforcement authorities and with the Labour Court.  Section 31 enables the WRC and other statutory enforcement authorities to advise each other of suspected offences under their respective remits which come to the notice of any of them.  Section 32 is designed to safeguard the wages and other statutory entitlements of employees who are working under public construction or other public contracts, while also ensuring competitive tendering and value for money in public expenditure.  Section 33 provides for the development of co-operation agreements between the WRC, the Labour Court and other specified official bodies.<\/p><p>Section 34 is intended to provide a statutory basis for administrative co-operation and the exchange of information between employment law compliance authorities of other states and the compliance section of the WRC.  Section 35 provides for the use of fixed payment notices in respect of a specified range of acts of non-compliance on the part of employers.  The use of this mechanism is intended to encourage compliance and reduce the need to rely on expensive and time-consuming prosecution procedures for the scheduled acts of non-compliance.<br\/><br\/>Part 4 comprises sections 36 to 51, inclusive, and makes provision for the new dispute resolution and adjudication structures.  Sections 36 and 37 provide for the appointment of case resolution officers to the WRC.  The WRC will offer an early resolution service in certain cases where complaints are lodged, generally in less complex disputes.  Sections 38 and 39 provide for the appointment of mediation officers to the Workplace Relations Commission and the provision of a mediation service to facilitate the resolution of employment rights disputes where possible at an early stage and without recourse to adjudication.  It is envisaged that mediation - unlike the early resolution service - will be offered to the parties in the more complex disputes, such as cases under the Employment Equality Acts and the Unfair Dismissal Acts requiring face-to-face mediation.<br\/><br\/>Participating in early resolution or mediation is entirely voluntary.  Parties availing of the early resolution or mediation service will neither lose the right to have their issues in dispute dealt with by means of inspection or a hearing, as appropriate to their case, nor be disadvantaged in relation to their waiting time for inspection or a hearing.  Should early resolution or mediation yield a compromise or settlement between the parties or a withdrawal of the complaint, the outcome will be confidential to the parties.  Likewise, if the early resolution or mediation process is unsuccessful, anything divulged by the parties in the process cannot be used subsequently in the adjudication or inspection process.<br\/><br\/>Section 40 makes provision for the appointment of adjudicators to the Workplace Relations Commission.  All first instance cases will be heard by the WRC in a fair and transparent manner in accordance with the law and the principles of natural justice.  To hit this high standard, adjudicators must be suitably skilled and trained for the role.<br\/><br\/>On the establishment of the WRC, the current cohort of equality officers and rights commissioners will be appointed as WRC adjudicators.  They will be supplemented by a panel of external adjudicators, comprising experienced industrial relations and HR practitioners and employment lawyers with appropriate skills and experience appointed by the Minister.  The Public Appointments Service has agreed to undertake the selection process for WRC adjudicators and advertisements for the competition were published on 26 September 2014.  Those selected for appointment on the panel of external adjudicators will then have to complete an accredited training programme and pass the associated examination.<br\/><br\/>Section 41 provides for standardised time limits of six months, extendable to 12 months for reasonable cause.  All first instance complaints requiring adjudication will be heard by WRC adjudication officers.  The adjudication officer will convene a hearing where both parties are given the opportunity to be heard and to decide the matter.  Parties will be free to represent themselves or choose their own representation.  All appeals will lie to the Labour Court, except in the case of complaints under the Equal Status Acts where the appeal will lie to the Circuit Court.  Adjudication officers will be required to conduct cases in accordance with the principles of constitutional and natural justice.  This obligation will include affording parties the right to cross-examine.<br\/><br\/>Section 41(11) has been subject to adverse comment in that it is alleged that it gives an adjudication officer the power to refuse a lawyer or other representative of a party access to proceedings.  This is not my intention and I propose to introduce a Committee Stage amendment to clarify this matter.<br\/><br\/>Section 42 empowers an adjudication officer to dismiss a complaint in circumstances where he or she forms the opinion that it is frivolous or vexatious.  Such a decision can be appealed to the Labour Court.<br\/><br\/>Sections 43 and 45 provide for a streamlined and more effective enforcement procedure for complainants whose complaints have been upheld at first instance by an adjudication officer of the WRC or upon appeal by the Labour Court.  The current system of enforcement of employment rights awards is cumbersome, expensive and not fit for purpose.  In my view, the difficulty experienced by successful complainants in enforcing awards made by those bodies in their favour is unsatisfactory.  Enforcement proceedings generally involve recourse to the civil courts and possibly the relevant sheriff's office, often without a successful outcome.<br\/><br\/>One of the central planks of my reform is to establish a new and robust enforcement regime which will provide successful complainants with an accessible and inexpensive means to enforce the award of the WRC adjudication service or of the Labour Court, as the case may be.  For this reason, I make provision in the Bill for a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the WRC adjudicators and Labour Court determinations.  The general scheme of the Bill, as approved by the Government in July 2012, provided for an improved and more robust system of enforcement of compensation awards under employment legislation via the District Court.  The scheme provided that non-compliance with an order of the WRC or the Labour Court, as the case may be, would be an offence prosecutable summarily in the District Court.  The enforcement provisions in the Bill, within sections 43 and 45, as published, do not currently make provision for an offence in such circumstances; however, this issue is the subject of further discussion between my Department, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General and I hope to table an amendment for consideration on Committee Stage which will satisfactorily address this issue.  I am confident that the introduction of these new measures will provide for more appropriate, efficient and effective enforcement of employment law.<br\/><br\/>Section 44 provides that either party to a first instance hearing will have the right to appeal the decision of a WRC adjudication officer to the Labour Court.  The Labour Court will act as a court of final appeal for all adjudication decisions of the WRC.  Appeals to the Labour Court will be <i>de novo<\/i>hearings held in public.  The Labour Court will have the power to establish its own procedures in relation to specified matters.  A consistent time limit of 42 days from the date of the first decision will apply to all appeal applications across all legislation.<br\/><br\/>Section 47 provides that the only route of appeal that parties will have from a decision of the Labour Court will be on a point of law to the High Court.  This provision does not impact on the supervisory role of the superior courts which may be exercised by way of judicial review.  Section 49 provides that the director general of the WRC and the Labour Court may strike out cases for want of prosecution where the director general or the Labour Court is satisfied that the complainant or appellant has not pursued the complaint or appeal within the period of one year.  Section 51 makes provision for the necessary consequential amendments to other employment enactments as a result of the new structures introduced by this Bill.  Details of the amendments to individual employment enactments are provided for in Schedule 6 of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Part 5, comprising of sections 52 to 60, inclusive, makes provision for a range of technical and transitional issues consequential on the dissolution of the Labour Relations Commission, LRC.  Section 55 provides for the transfer of all functions from the LRC to the Workplace Relations Commission.  The functions which are currently vested in the Labour Relations Commission, including the industrial relations conciliation, advisory, training and research services, will transfer to the Workplace Relations Commission.<br\/><br\/>Part 6, comprising sections 61 to 66, inclusive, makes provision for a range of technical and transitional issues consequential on the dissolution of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT.  The tribunal will continue to function for a limited period after the establishment of the WRC to dispose of all legacy first instance complaints and appeals referred to it prior to the establishment date of the WRC, including cases which a division of the EAT had commenced hearing.  The decision to extend the period of operation of the EAT beyond the establishment of the new framework is predicated on the assumption that complainants and respondents in matters referred to the EAT prior to the establishment of the WRC would have a legitimate expectation of having the case disposed of before a tripartite tribunal, sitting in public and operating with the degree of procedural formality currently applied by the EAT.<br\/><br\/>Section 64 provides for the transfer of functions from the Employment Appeals Tribunal to the Labour Court.  This does not include the first instance functions which the tribunal currently carries out under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, Redundancy Payments Acts and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts which will transfer to the WRC.<br\/><br\/>Part 7 comprises sections 69 to 82, inclusive.  Section 69 enables the Minister to provide by regulation for the levying of fees and charges on the users of services to be provided by the Commission or the Labour Court.<\/p><p>I have decided not to introduce charges on parties for access to the WRC services for many reasons, chief among which is the belief that so-called forum shopping will not be a feature in the new system.  I am proposing, however, the introduction of a fee in one particular instance, namely, where a party who failed to appear at a first instance hearing of the WRC without good cause wishes to appeal the decision to the Labour Court, in which case that party will have to pay a fee of &euro;300 when lodging their appeal.  If the Labour Court determines that the party in question had good cause for failing to attend the first instance hearing, the fee will be refunded.<\/p><p> Sections 73, 75 and 77 provide for appointment to the positions of chairman, deputy chairman and ordinary members of the Labour Court.  The Labour Court has three divisions and nine members, a chairman, two deputy chairs and six ordinary members, and it sits in divisions of three.  The Bill will provide that the expanded Labour Court will have four divisions but restructured for greater efficiency to allow the court deal with double the appeals with only one additional division.  The Bill provides that the appointments of chairman and deputy chairman to the court by the Minister shall in future be through the Public Appointments Service.  The new arrangements will not apply to the persons who, immediately before the enactment of the Bill, stood appointed as chairman and deputy chair, and the present incumbents will continue to serve in these positions for the unexpired period of their respective terms of appointment.<\/p><p> Regarding the appointment of ordinary members, the Minister was obliged to appoint a person nominated by either an organisation representative of trade unions or a trade union representative of employers.  The change proposed will require those bodies to put forward three names of candidates for appointment in respect of each vacancy for an ordinary member.  The Minister will then choose one person from the panel for appointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800011#J00600","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412763600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting the Minister but he is slightly over time.

Section 76 provides for the making of regulations by the Minister, after consultation with the chairman, whereby certain functions of the Labour Court may be performed by the chairman or a deputy chairman sitting alone.  In particular, such regulations may provide that certain specified preliminary applications or procedural matters can be dealt with by the chairman or a deputy chairman sitting alone.<br\/><br\/>Section 78 provides for the consequential amendments to the Unfair Dismissals Acts as a result of the new adjudication structures being introduced by the Bill.  I propose to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to make it clear that all referrals under the Unfair Dismissals Acts made after the commencement of Part 4 will be subject to Part 4, that is, these referrals will be dealt with by the WRC rather than the EAT.<br\/><br\/>I will comment briefly on the six Schedules to the Bill.  Schedule 1<b><\/b>contains a list of the relevant employment Acts, the provisions of Acts of the Oireachtas and statutory instruments that are included in the definition of &quot;employment enactments&quot;.  Schedule 2 contains a list of the provisions within individual Acts of the Oireachtas that will be repealed upon the commencement of the Bill.  Schedule 3 sets out details of the corporate structure of the new WRC, including the appointment of a statutory board to the WRC.  Schedule 4 sets out details of the list of contraventions of employment enactments for the purpose of compliance notices.  Schedule 5 sets out details of the individual employment enactments under which a person will be able to present a complaint or refer a dispute to the WRC.  Schedule 6<b><i><\/i><\/b>sets out the consequential amendments it will be necessary to make to other employment enactments as a result of the new structures.<br\/><br\/>My Department is in discussion with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on a number of issues where the Bill does not fully reflect the policy as set out in the heads approved by Government.  There are also more minor drafting points and consequential amendments to other employment Acts under discussion which I propose to address with amendments on Committee Stage.  As a result, I will bring forward a number of Government amendments on Committee Stage.  I know I will get considerable co-operation from the committee and its Chairman, who is present.<br\/><br\/>The key issues which I propose to address by way of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage include powers of inspectors in section 66, to ensure they have appropriate powers to carry out their duties, subject to the constitutional rights of employers and employees.  On adjudication, I propose to put forward amendments to the provisions governing the Unfair Dismissals Acts, Redundancy Payment Acts and Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts to clarify that such cases referred after the commencement of Part 4 will be subject to Part 4.  Under enforcement, as I mentioned, I propose to introduce amendments to the enforcement provisions in sections 43 and 45 to provide that non-compliance would be an offence, prosecutable summarily in the District Court.<i><\/i>Schedules 2 and 6 do not yet fully provide for the consequential amendments and repeals required to other enactments which come within the definition of &quot;employment legislation&quot; and the amendments will reflect the change.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel will continue to review and re-draft the Schedules, in consultation with the Department.  Amendments to sections 73 and 77 are to ensure appropriate provisions are included in the Bill on the appointment and re-appointment of deputy chairmen and<br\/><br\/>members of the Labour Court.<br\/><br\/>I look forward to the contributions of Deputies.  The Bill will be significant, modernising legislation.  It is a good example of public service reform which will deliver better value for money to the users of the scheme.  The system will be easier to use, will be better, will encourage compliance and early settlement and will have a more effective system of enforcement.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800014#M00300","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1412763600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I apologise on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, who cannot be present, and who asked me to contribute to the Bill on his behalf.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Government&rsquo;s decision to reform the State&rsquo;s existing employment rights and industrial relations structures, a process which was commenced by my colleague, Deputy Calleary, in the previous Government.  Ireland has a stellar reputation internationally in the area of workplace relations.  One of the reasons we remain a location that is highly favoured by foreign direct investment is that, compared with our competitors, the number of industrial disputes in Ireland is notably lower.  We must, however, remain vigilant in the face of increasing competition internationally.  We must ensure our employees and employers are provided with the proper workplace mechanisms to ensure disputes which will inevitably arise will be addressed in an effective manner.  We must remain ahead of the game when it comes to improving our structures within the State.  We believe the Bill will be a first step in guaranteeing the structures needed for the coming years.<\/p><p>  It has been put forward that the current system for resolving individual disputes related to the workplace is wasteful, both in terms of State resources and those of users.  It has also been said that there has been significant frustration for employers, employees and professionals representing them in how the current mechanism is structured.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il support the Government&rsquo;s objective to deliver a world-class workplace relations service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost-effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period.  A cost-effective system which delivers for employer and employee alike would result in significant benefits for the economy overall.  The system that developed over the past 60 years, while serving a purpose as the structures developed, may indeed have become unwieldy, complex, inconsistent, slow and, in some cases, expensive for users.  We support a streamlining of those structures to deliver a better service to those who find themselves having to rely on the mechanisms of the State to broker a compromise.<\/p><p>  The Bill before the House marks a new departure in the sense that it provides a statutory basis for a new structure which will see the existing five State bodies replaced by two.  That makes sense in the context of reduced budgets for all State agencies, but also in terms of simplifying the bodies dealing with an area which needs less complication and more effectiveness.  We welcome that the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, the Equality Tribunal, the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT, and the first instance functions of the Labour Court will be replaced by the new Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the appellate functions of the EAT will be transferred to a new expanded Labour Court.<\/p><p>  We welcome that the Bill seeks to create a modern, user-friendly, world-class employment workplace relations system that will provide significant benefits for its users and society as a whole.  The focus must be on resolving workplace disputes as quickly and inexpensively as possible.  The State must also commit to providing the necessary resources to ensure the new structures work and work well.  It is notable how all institutions, agencies and bodies in the State struggle to provide the services they are required to provide on an increasingly reduced budget.  Many State institutions are struggling.  Whether it is the National Library, the Courts Service or any hospital in the country, the message is clear.  They can take no further reductions in budget to do their job.  In that regard, I urge the Government to ensure that with a streamlined mechanism for workplace relations, the reduction in bodies will not result in a higher proportion of cuts to the budgets required to deliver the new services.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the key measures that are contained in the Bill.  The fact that the services of the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, the Labour Relations Commission and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT, are to come together under the remit of the workplace relations commission, WRC, is a sensible move.  The same can be said of moving the appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal to be amalgamated into a reconfigured Labour Court.  What we on this side of the House would like to see clarification on, however, is how the officers of the respective bodies are to be integrated and the Minister might outline this in his response.  I also assume there will be some savings made through the streamlining of services, the sharing of services and the reduction in facilities costs.  Again, this is something on which I would welcome clarification from the Minister.<\/p><p> The current scenario where disputes or complaints are addressed by means of a rights commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, an equality officer, the Labour Court or NERA inspection, depending on the legislation involved, is far too complex and not conducive to an effective mechanism for resolution.  This Bill, replacing the existing complex system of five different bodies with a straightforward, two-tier system for employment rights and industrial relations disputes, must be welcomed.  It makes sense for the workplace relations commission to deal with all cases in the first instance and subsequently for the Labour Court to deal with all cases on appeal.<\/p><p> We also welcome the creation of the position of director general of the workplace relations commission, ensuring a single point of leadership rather than the four that exist in NERA, the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Equality Tribunal.  I would, however, ask the Minister to clarify why he has decided that the staffing of the workplace relations commission will in future come from officials from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  This is an interesting move but one which could prove controversial if the independence of the workplace relations commission is undermined through supposed political interference.  I would welcome hearing the Minister's rationale for this move.<\/p><p> This Bill will be judged either as a success or a failure not on whether the structures look well on paper or even on how much money the streamlining of services will save.  It will be judged as a success only if it provides the citizens and companies of Ireland with a more effective and cost-effective service in finding resolutions to disputes, vindicating the rights of workers and employers and securing Ireland as a great place to invest and do business into the future.  Employees in Ireland are entitled to receive certain basic employment rights and those rights often need to be guarded.  We hope that the Bill will make those rights easier to guard then previously. <\/p><p> I reaffirm my party's support for the Bill.  We hope to offer constructive criticism as the Bill goes through the Oireachtas and we look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800014#M00400","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412764200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I apologise on behalf of Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n who could not attend today as he has a funeral in his constituency.<\/p><p>  It is important to state from the outset that it is a shared objective of the Members of this House to reform the current industrial relations structures.  From Sinn F&eacute;in's perspective, we have stated from the start of the Minister's consultations with stakeholders that we will support progressive proposals aimed at strengthening workers' rights, streamlining and simplifying employment rights bodies and procedures, ensuring satisfactory resolutions of workplace disputes and the robust and fair enforcement and compliance with employment rights legislation.  As the Minister has acknowledged, promoting and supporting harmonious relationships in the workplace is an important element in achieving lasting economic growth and creating and sustaining jobs.  It is our strong view that the best way to achieve this is through mutual recognition, respect and the creation of a level playing field.<\/p><p>  Aiming for lasting economic growth built on a foundation of sustainable jobs means the Minister and his cabinet colleagues must confront issues such as trade union recognition, compliance with and enforcement of existing employment legislation, underemployment, excessively low pay and the myriad of issues facing vulnerable workers such as informal insolvencies, blacklisting and the rogue actions of subcontractors who are forcing workers into registering as sole traders.  Reforming employment rights structures is a good move but it will mean little at the end of the day if fundamental flaws in employment rights are not dealt with.  On most of the issues mentioned the Minister's silence has been deafening.<\/p><p>  Some 129,700 workers in this State are underemployed and some 300,000 workers, or one in five, are earning less than the living wage of &euro;11.45 an hour.  To put this meagre salary into context, a worker on a living wage earns just 14% of the Minister's current salary.  One in ten working families is in receipt of a family income supplement payment.  Of course, low pay is not just the preserve of the private sector as nearly one in ten recipients of family income supplement payments are public servants.  We should not forget that hundreds of JobBridge participants work in Government Departments each year never to be offered a full-time position, despite the critically important work that they do.  Some 120,000 workers are living in poverty - those working in hospitality are most at risk and, not surprisingly, those working in the financial sector are least so. <\/p><p>  Prior to the local and European elections we were promised a low pay commission but the necessary legislation remains languishing on the C list of the Government's legislative programme despite the fact the Government had the summer to draft what must be a straightforward piece of legislation.  In addition to establishing the commission on a statutory basis and progressing the legislative process, the Minister said consideration is being given to establishing the commission on an interim administrative basis to carry out its functions as early as possible.  When will we see progress on this and why is there a delay in publishing the draft heads of the bill?  The challenges facing workers in a deeply competitive employment market mean we believe it is critical that, in enhancing workers' rights, the issues of trade union recognition and the right to collective bargaining be addressed.  This is perhaps a debate for another day but underpinning all employment rights legislation must be a commitment by the Government that such rights will be defended and upheld.<\/p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's workers' rights spokesperson, Senator David Cullinane, raised a number of areas of concern in his submission on behalf of the party to the Government consultation process on the proposed changes to the industrial relations structures.  We welcome the Minister's decision to constructively engage with our submission and in a number of instances he has heeded our concerns.  We hope that on Committee Stage of the legislation amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies will be given the same consideration.<\/p><p>  The right to take a case, have it heard and adjudicated upon fairly by an independent third party and the right to an appeal must be the cornerstone of the broad area of employment rights.  We welcome proposals to reform the structures of the employment rights bodies and the delivery of a more efficient, fair, simple and user-friendly system is also to be welcomed.  It is also good that employees attending the various services of the WRC, be it the early resolution service, the mediation service or attending before the commission, will be entitled to trade union representation at all times.<\/p><p>  Concerns were raised by many trade unions and others in their submissions regarding the role of the registrar as set out by the Minister at the start of the process.  In effect, he or she will act as a filtering mechanism deciding which cases should or should not proceed.  We note that the Minister likened the role of the registrar to that of the legal advisor to the Equality Tribunal and we note too the case law the Minister quoted in responses to parliamentary questions.  Of course, a small number of cases will fall before they begin for technical reasons but transparency regarding these decisions by the registrar will be critically important.<\/p><p>  An adjudicating officer may dismiss a complaint on the opinion that it is frivolous or vexatious and anxiety is always heightened when officialdom uses this language - too often we are not aware of how such charges are measured.  We welcome the Minister's decision to provide for an appeals process to the Labour Court where an adjudicator dismisses a case in these circumstances.  Again, in the Minister's initial proposals he indicated his intention to remove the right to an appeal - a measure we absolutely opposed in our submission.  The right to an appeal must be an absolute entitlement, an integral part of due process, and we are not alone in this view.<\/p><p>  Concern was raised regarding the Minister's proposed introduction of fees for access to WRC services.  He also sought a reduction in the time limit for making complaints - he wishes the limit to be six months.  We recommended a time limit of years and the right to seek to extend the date where there is reasonable cause.  While the legislation enables the Minister, through regulations, to levy fees and charges on users of the WRC and the Labour Court, it appears the Minister only intends to do so where a party fails, without good cause, to appear at the first instance hearing of the WRC and then wishes to appeal the decision to the Labour Court.  When lodging the appeal the party will have to pay a fee of &euro;300 which will be refunded if the Labour Court determines good cause.<\/p><p>It would appear that while the Minister may not intend to introduce fees for accessing the Workplace Relations Commission at this time, the legislation enables him or a future Minister to do so at any time.  It is worth noting that in their submissions to the Government&rsquo;s workplace relations blueprint review, employer representative groups such as the American Chamber of Commerce and ISME sought the introduction of fees when making an initial complaint.  The legislation imposes a time limit of six months within which to make a complaint, beginning on the date of the contravention to which the complaint relates, which is clearly not sufficient.<\/p><p> Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked the Minister in a parliamentary question last month to set out the checks and balances that have been put in place to ensure equality rights will not be eroded as a result of the subsuming of the Equality Tribunal into the WRC.  There are a number of concerns regarding the upholding of equality legislation within the legislation as it is presented.  Equality officers in the Equality Tribunal will transfer to the Workplace Relations Commission to become part of a wider pool of adjudicators.  It does not appear that specialist adjudicators trained in the complex area of equality law will be assigned to equality or equal status cases.  It appears the legislation does not specifically outline how equal status cases will be dealt with.  When complaints are lodged with the Equality Tribunal currently, its officers apply the legislation to the case to determine the issues and how the case should proceed.  Concern has been raised that the commission's adjudication process may require complaints to lodge a more legally robust case in the first instance, and this enhanced requirement may act as a barrier to future cases.<\/p><p> Enforcement and compliance remain two key areas of concerns pre and post the consultative process.  We raised concerns in our submission regarding the proposed compliance notices, fixed charge notices and Labour Court orders to enforce compliance by employers to reduce the need to resort to prosecution.  While employers who are generally compliant with employment rights law should not be unfairly punished for unintentional breaches, a balance must be struck where serious or consistent breaches occur.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked the Minister last month what further action will be taken in the event an employer pays in full and in time a fixed payment notice but does not discharge in part or in full the outstanding award to a current or former employee to whom the notice relates.  As is often the case, the Minister did not answer the question.  We are no clearer as to what happens in such a circumstance.  Almost all workers and employment rights bodies were unanimous in their opinion that a hefty fine and the imposition of a fixed charge notice should not rule out the possibility of prosecution.  As the Minister noted, if the person on whom the notice is served pays the charge, the matter will not proceed to court.  Arguably the monetary figure provided for in the legislation could result in an employer hedging his or her bets, coughing up the cash for a fixed payment notice, avoiding prosecution and having more money in his or her pocket where the notice amounts to less than the outstanding award.<\/p><p> It does not appear the Minister has struck a balance in these provisions.  It is important to state why enforcement is necessary in the first place; it is because employers regularly breach employment law.  It is that simple.  I hope the Minister will engage constructively with Opposition Deputies on Committee and Report Stages of the legislation and will consider amendments put forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800015#N00200","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412764800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Joan Collins who is sharing time with Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Finian McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800016#O00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1412764800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Like many people I welcome the fact we are discussing the Workplace Relations Bill and the Workplace Relations Commission.  We should include in our discussion the context of what is happening in communities.  According to the 2014 OECD employment outlook report, Ireland has the second highest percentage of low paid jobs after the US.  Portugal has the lowest percentage.  Yesterday was world day for decent work and the Mandate union announced a dramatic reduction in the quality of employment in recent years.  Since 2008 it has seen a 60% increase in involuntary part-time working, which is where workers want more hours but do not have access to them.<\/p><p>  Mandate will be in the Labour Court on 29 October and it hopes the employer in the case will turn up.  This is indicative of workers' rights at present.  Frequently companies and employers do not attend the State mechanism for dealing with workers' and employers' rights.  To my mind, employers have too many rights.  We have seen very disturbing incidents recently, such as the Paris Bakery workers who were left high and dry for weeks on end without any income from social welfare.  The company moved out and tried to take all the machinery with it.  The workers tried continually to go to the Labour Court and use State machinery to resolve the issue.  Eventually it was resolved with intervention, but outside of the State mechanism.<\/p><p>  We also had the Greyhound workers, who were locked out from 17 June.  In the process involving the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission, the employer did not recognise the recommendations given and contrived to lock out 78 workers.  Those men were on the streets outside the workplace for three months.  It was only resolved with court intervention, through the solicitors for SIPTU and Greyhound who came to an arrangement for the workers either to take voluntary redundancy or return to work, as 24 of them did under worse conditions than those from which they were locked out.  This highlights the necessity to examine working conditions and pay and how the industry operates and cut across the race to the bottom.  I do not know whether the Bill has the robustness to deal with some of the issues raised in the dispute.<\/p><p>  We have another situation with 17 workers at Kishoge community college in Lucan.  The contractor was paid &euro;95,000 but only &euro;35,000 has been paid to the workers.  Issues arise with regard to relevant contract tax and the workers having to be self-employed subcontractors.  The money trickling down to the brickies means they are being paid only &euro;5 an hour, which they can prove with their bank accounts and what they receive in their wages.  The company was able to lock out the workers on 1 September.  The workers have no recourse and their union is trying to get into the Labour Court to resolve the issue and get them back to work.  In the meantime, other workers are being brought in to do the work.  Scab labour is being brought in, as happened at Greyhound.  It is very difficult for workers on a picket line to see their work being done by people earning less money than they should be.<\/p><p>  These projects were supposed to be about putting money back into the economy.  I spoke to the workers in Lucan on Monday and they told me all the equipment and parts, including the concrete and machinery, are being brought down from the North, so there is no benefit to the local economy from these public contracts.  We know the pension fund is being raided for the projects, with &euro;770 million being taken from it two weeks ago.  A total of &euro;2 billion has been taken from the pension fund for these projects, which are supposed to be for the benefit of the economy.  If the workers in the industries are not paid enough money to earn a living, how is it of benefit to the economy?  It will do no good whatsoever.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Education and Skills stated during Question Time today that she will meet the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, to examine the Lucan workers' registered employment agreement and see whether the issue can be resolved.  It must move much more quickly than this because the workers have not been paid since 1 September.  This is a very difficult situation for men who want to work.  Some of them had to leave this country a short time ago to go to Australia and have returned home hoping to get decent work in the local economy.   They have been left stranded for the past five weeks.<\/p><p>The legislation needs to be much more robust.  How can an employer going through with a process with a union and workers' representation unilaterally move to lock out these workers and sack them?  I do not believe this legislation is robust enough to deal with that.<\/p><p> The previous Deputy spoke about the fixed-payment notices.  There is a time limit on the process of going through the Circuit Court.  However, the other aspects of labour law need to be brought in - the minimum wage commission.  All those areas need to be strengthened to protect workers from rogue employers.  Most employers will go through the process, but there are a series of rogue employers who unilaterally do not even recognise the Labour Court or the structures within the State.<\/p><p> This is a public school being paid for by the pension fund being raided, which is the people's money.  The 70 workers still outside the gate need the matter to be resolved and need an intervention by the Government to be able to resolve the issue.  JJ Rhatigan &amp;amp; Company claims it has subcontracted the work and does not employ brickies.  It does not employ brickies, but it employs a subcontractor to employ brickies who work on an RCT rate.<\/p><p> These are the issues that need to be dealt with through the Workplace Relations Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800016#O00300","speaker":"1193","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412765400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Obviously it is positive to be discussing any measure that will improve workplace relations and streamline the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, and the whole area of workers' rights and conciliation in cases of dispute.  However, I am not sure that what the Minister is proposing here will achieve that aim.  I am not against - I would be broadly for - streamlining the system, making it more accessible, speeding it up because of course there have been major delays, and allowing people to understand clearly how to access the industrial relations and the employment rights machinery of the State.  From that point of view, the aims are reasonably laudable but there is probably a big gap between the aims and the means by which the Minister is proposing to deliver on those aims.<\/p><p>  I wish to take up from where Deputy Joan Collins left off.  It is not just about the machinery we have to vindicate the rights of people; it is also about identifying the rights of people.  The context of this is that workers' rights in terms of the legal protection workers have are completely inadequate.  The pitch is tipped very much in favour of employers as we discovered in some of the recent disputes and disputes going back over a number of years in which workers have been shafted by rogue employers with very little recourse or great difficulty getting recourse.<\/p><p>  One dispute, which I have to encounter literally day because the venue of the dispute is right next door to my constituency office and which I have raised with the Minister on a number of occasions, is the Connolly Shoes dispute.  Those workers are still picketing four years later.  It is extraordinary.  When they were eventually able to access the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Labour Court and the whole lot, their case was completely vindicated and the employer was shown to be in the wrong.  He had not paid them moneys owed and had unfairly dismissed them.  All of this was established and he has just completely refused to engage and refuses to pay them.<\/p><p>  When the representatives of the workers have pursued the money through the courts and so on, he has hidden the money behind shelf companies he owns.  Suddenly workers who thought they were working for Connolly Shoes discovered they were not working for Connolly Shoes but working for some other outfit, which happens to be owned by exactly the same guy, but apparently has no assets.  So he has a range of different companies, some of which have the money insulated from any recourse for the workers to get hold of the money that the industrial relations machinery has determined they are owed.  Everybody is throwing their hands up, claiming there is nothing they can do.  It has taken four years and it looks as if they may have just about got there now.  It is extraordinary to have workers picketing and in dispute for four years after essentially being turfed out by a rogue employer who refuses to pay them their entitlements.<\/p><p>  These are real problems.  We had something similar with the Vita Cortex dispute and the occupation that took place in Cork.  We have a number of these instances where our laws allow rogue employers to hide from their responsibilities and obligations to their workers by essentially playing fast and loose with company law which allows them to do that.  We need to do something about that.<\/p><p>  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has to address this.  I do not claim it is an easy matter, but if a series of companies have the same directors and owners, and one of those companies has been found to be abusing the rights of those workers and has an obligation to pay them, there must be some way to prevent that person from hiding their assets with other companies.  That just has to stop, as must hiding money offshore, as Deputy Joan Collins mentioned.  There seems to be no political will on the part of the Government to make it stop.  I want the Government to outline what it will do on that front.<\/p><p>  What happened in the Greyhound dispute - we are now seeing it with JJ Rhatigan - is just not acceptable.  Something needs to be done where employers decide they want something and if they do not get it they can just lock workers out.  There was much hoo-ha and criticism by certain quarters about workers who were blockading the Greyhound depot.  However, not mentioned enough in those discussions was that those workers arrived at work at 7 o'clock one morning and without any warning, discussion, consultation or negotiation there was a guy outside with a new contract with a 30% pay cut.  He said, &quot;Sign this or get lost.&quot;  The workers said they would not accept that and were told, &quot;Sorry, you're out.  We have a bus-load of scabs we're going to bring in to do your job.&quot;  Those workers were then forced to go through eight or nine weeks of a dispute in order to force him even into negotiation.  Laws need to be changed to make it impossible for employers to treat workers in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800017#P00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412765400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1412765400,"counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800017#P00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1412765400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputies Pat Breen and Kieran O'Donnell - the need to alleviate the overcrowding in the accident and emergency unit at University Hospital Limerick; (2) Deputies Robert Troy and James Bannon - the need to address the funding crisis currently being experienced by St. Christopher's care centre, Longford; (3) Deputy Jim Daly - the need to reconsider and reduce the water charges for adult dependants; (4) Deputy Niall Collins - the need to address the increase in anti-social behaviour in Dublin city centre; (5) Deputy Terence Flanagan - the need to introduce a cap on the interest that can be charged by moneylender loans; (6) Deputy Derek Nolan - the urgent need for a new emergency department unit at University Hospital Galway; (7) Deputy Noel Coonan - the position regarding the Templemore flood relief scheme; (8) Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall - the need to update regulations under the misuse of drugs legislation to curb the open street trading of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs; (9) Deputy Patrick O'Donovan - the need for immediate works to be carried out on the Newcastle West Garda station; (10) Deputy Brendan Griffin - the importance of the retention of the 9% rate of VAT for tourism services; (11) Deputy Timmy Dooley - the need for a resolution of the Irish airlines superannuation scheme; (12) Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n - the need for an investigation into exploitative worker and tax practices at the publically funded new Kishoge community college project in Lucan, County Dublin; (13) Deputy Brian Stanley -  the shortcomings in services for autistic children and their families in County Laois; (14) Deputy Martin Heydon - the national broadband plan with reference to rural areas particularly in County Kildare; (15) Deputy Michael Moynihan - the need to address the difficulties families face in paying their energy bills; (16) Deputy Billy Kelleher - the alleged manipulation of hospital waiting lists; (17) Deputy Colm Keaveney - the funding for disability organisations being reduced on the basis of value for money; (18) Deputy Robert Dowds - the ongoing industrial dispute at the Kishoge community college construction site; (19) Deputy Arthur Spring - the non-adherence to legislation in respect of State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014; (20) Deputy Martin Ferris - Irish Water's position regarding old council houses with lead piping; (21) Deputy Mick Wallace - Part V of the Planning Act regarding the delivery of social housing; (22) Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in - the alleged manipulation of hospital waiting lists; (23) Deputy Catherine Murphy - the worsening disparity in average class sizes from county to county; and (24) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett - the EU Commission's investigation into the corporate tax rate here and possible deals with certain multinational companies.<\/p><p>  The matters raised by Deputies Pat Breen and Kieran O'Donnell, Robert Troy and James Bannon, Noel Coonan and Arthur Spring have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800017#P00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1412766000,"counter":175,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800018#Q00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1412766000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>When I asked the Taoiseach a number of questions yesterday about Irish Water, following Deputy Fergus O'Dowd's comments that it has been an unmitigated disaster, an abject failure and much more, the Taoiseach responded that, in his view, Deputy O'Dowd was simply saying it had teething problems.  That response illustrated how out of touch the Taoiseach is with the situation on the ground and with people's attitudes.  Deputy O'Dowd was certainly right in saying there is an intense dislike of the entire process and that people feel angry and intimidated.<\/p><p>  The fundamental aspect that is absent from the water rates regime that is being introduced via Irish Water and via the regulator is the ability to pay principle.  Deputy O'Dowd said yesterday that as Minister of State, he pleaded with his senior Minister and with other Government members that there be exemptions for disadvantaged groups including, in particular, the unemployed.  There is absolutely no protection under this regime for the more than 370,000 people on the live register.  The households benefits package does not include those who are out of work.  Second, there is no protection for low-income earners, of whom we have the second highest proportion in the OECD.  Consumption taxes are by their nature regressive, but nothing has been built into this charging regime to protect low-income workers, one in five of whom, we are told, are earning below the living wage.  Third, we have families with three, four and five adults who will face very significant bills.  The estimated charge is &euro;380 for a three-adult family, &euro;482 for a four-adult household, and &euro;584 where there are five adults in the home.  We are talking here about dependent young people in full-time education or unemployed.  Those families are being screwed by this regime.  The estimates are extraordinarily high, with no mitigation whatsoever.  To add insult to injury, those on boil water notices will receive a bill and will have to pay for the water-out element of the regime, notwithstanding the significant expenditure they have faced as a result of having to boil water.<\/p><p>  Will the Taoiseach amend the legislation to enshrine at its heart an ability to pay clause?

I do not accept the comments from the former Minister of State who piloted the relevant Bill through the House that Irish Water is as he says.  I do accept, as everybody does, that some of the issues that were raised in the initial stages of the establishment of Irish Water were not as they should be.  Clearly, there was not the clarity of explanation and understanding given to people as to what this was about.  What it is about is putting in place one of the largest and most fundamental entities in the history of our State to provide proper water structures and proper water quality for households, businesses and industry.  Yes, there is a contribution to be made.  Deputy Martin's colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in do now want any domestic water charges and are putting it back on the public bill at a cost of &euro;850 million in taxes or whatever without any explanation.<\/p><p>  This issue must be dealt with.  We cannot go on paying &euro;1.2 billion per year for the production of water, with 40% of it leaking away, thousands of people on boil water notices, dozens of treatment works not up to standard and kilometres by the thousand of inferior pipe work.  All of that has to be dealt with, and it never was dealt with because the Deputy and his party, for the main part, during its time in government over the past 25 years, did not deal with it.  Irish Water will be able to borrow to invest and fix these problems, and a contribution is being asked of people.  That is why the Government gave a direction to the regulator such that there would be an allowance per household and per child, with extra to be given for those living alone.  The 340,000 people on the household benefits package will receive extra allowances, and those with particular medical needs will have a cap put on what they pay.<\/p><p>  I recognise that any charge that is put on people is not easy to accept, but this is an issue that simply must be dealt with.  As the Deputy well knows, in huge areas of the country people have been paying for water for 50 years, by way of regional water schemes and whatever else.  Where water goes out, if it goes into a public sewer, that must be paid for because it has to be treated.  If it goes into a septic tank for which there is a charge and a monitoring system, it will not have to be paid for because it does not go back into the public system.  There are many multiples of thousands of households in that situation.  It is not nice to have to pay a charge.  It has not been easy for any member of the Government in the past three years to have to stand up and impose charges in order to get us out of the catastrophe in which the Deputy's party left us.  I am glad to see that economic commentators are now projecting growth for this year and next of between 4.5% and 5% and in the following years in the mid-threes.  These are positive things.<\/p><p>  The Government will consider very carefully the question of the structure of payments, namely, how payments can be made and when they can be made.  We must help people to understand that water is an absolutely essential commodity and something not to be wasted.  As I said, 40% of it is leaking away every day.  If the Deputy filled his oil tank in Cork every Monday only to find that 40% of it was gone by Wednesday, what would he say?  He would say the problem must be fixed.  Everybody can contribute to fixing the problems with our water supply, in one way or another.  There are allowances built in for the categories of people who need them most.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800018#Q01300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412766000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1412766000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Martin, I wish to point out that I get complaints into my office every day that the same people are causing a disturbance in the Chamber.

The Taoiseach has not done that in the regime his Government is introducing.  Deputy O'Dowd - who, as Minister of State, introduced the legislation - said as much yesterday.<\/p><p>  I asked the Taoiseach about the situation for the 370,000 people who are out of work.

We believe those categories merit a substantive response and not the false assertions and the usual stuff the Taoiseach goes on with.  Can the Taoiseach specifically speak to the unemployed in terms of water charges?  Can he speak to the families with children over 18 years of age who are going to college or who are unemployed?  Will he address the questions asked of him, because he has neglected them?  In fairness to Deputy O'Dowd, out of office he has had the honesty to say that a poverty analysis was done by the Department but it has never been published.  Why has it not been published?

Our budget proposals include a proposal to build 6,000 new homes over the next 18 months and it tells the Taoiseach how this should be funded.  I do not know if the Taoiseach has noticed but there are 20,000 applications for housing in Dublin City Council, which is an increase of 3,000 since last year.  The real number is higher but this particular Dublin council list verifies that all of these citizens have had their need for housing established by the council.

Some 1,136 applicants are homeless in this city, and that is repeated throughout this State.  <\/p><p>  In addition to the main waiting list, 5,645 tenants are already living in social housing but are seeking to transfer because one quarter of them are living in overcrowded conditions and others need to move out of flats because they do not have wheelchair access.

In my constituency, there are more than 5,000 on the housing list.  <\/p><p>  What is the Government's plan to deal with this ongoing crisis?  The ESRI has called on the Government to make a major investment in social housing in the next week's budget instead of making the tax cuts it has been promising.

Will he accept the proposition from the ESRI to invest in social housing instead of making the tax cuts the Government has been proposing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800019#R01800","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1412766600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Adams.  In regard to his comment on the water charges, I understand Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that domestic water charges should be abolished and that this would then go back on the public pay bill.  This would impose a charge of &euro;850 million to be raised.  I understand from its submission that it has left aside something like &euro;300 million, leaving a hole in that particular area of &euro;550 million, which it would need to explain.<\/p><p>  I also understand that Sinn F&eacute;in wants to increase employers' PRSI by 5% and increase the top rate of income tax by 7%.  That is an is an additional 12 percentage point tax on jobs.  I am not sure if Sinn F&eacute;in is serious about this because if it is, it would drive every employer and every potential investor out of the country in terms of the creation of jobs.  That would leave us with Sinn F&eacute;in's proposition of a 48% income tax rate, raising &euro;365 million three years in a row.  By implementing a 7% tax increase three times, it would raise the top income tax rate to more than 62%, leaving an incredible total tax rate of 73% when USC and PRSI are included.  If it wants to close down the country, that is the kind of economics it should be proceeding with because it is not credible or real.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Adams raised a very important issue about housing.  I want him to understand that the Government will respond to this, alongside the budget next week and in the time ahead.  Clearly, there is a serious supply and demand issue, in particular in the greater Dublin area.  The issue of homelessness, of those who have been put out of apartments and houses because of rent increases and of the demand for housing - a demand which is rising very rapidly - is a cause of great concern.  The recently published planning Bill, being dealt with by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, provides for a vacant site levy of 3% to encourage development, a new Part 5 to deliver 4,000 additional units by 2020, changes to development contributions and the use it or lose it approach to planning permissions.  These are all designed to make an impact on the construction sector.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Adams knows contractors will not build houses unless it is profitable for them to do so.  The Government is acutely aware of the fact we need an income stream for contractors to build and for buyers to purchases and a planning process in place to allow for that to happen.<\/p><p>There are many thousands of houses for which planning permission has been approved under the old regulations, some of them in the wrong place, but we will look at the incentives that might be brought in to make an impact on how this can happen.<\/p><p> The Government will publish shortly a five-year social housing strategy, which is the key commitment of the Construction 2020 document that we published.  The need for social housing based on last year's assessment is very well documented and accepted by everyone.  The Housing Agency has admitted that to meet housing need over the next five years, we need 35,000 housing units to be provided.  The Government's challenge is to meet social housing need in an innovative and cost-effective manner.  The ESRI has put forward its view, as some of the others have as well.  The Government has to make a decision on this, and the strategy being finalised will take into account budget 2015 and will be published by the Minister, Deputy Kelly, very shortly after the budget.  Deputy Adams should know that we are acutely conscious of it, as are the people looking for housing who will be accommodated in social housing.  Government will produce its specific strategy and plan, alongside the budget, in the very near future taking into account all these very valid submissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800019#R01900","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412767200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>We made a very valid submission which the Taoiseach misrepresented, deliberately and maliciously, in what he said.

Given the amount of our money that has been spent by Irish Water on public relations, that should be surprising, but what it fails to acknowledge is that it is not the delivery of the message that is at the heart of the problem.  It is the substance of the message that people have a problem with.  No one, regardless of how good a communicator they are, can convince families with adult children living at home, some of whom are full-time students, those on jobseeker's payments or the more than 30% of people who cannot pay their utility bills that they will have the ability to pay another bill.  They are already struggling, and they know that daily struggle better than anyone.  Who is selling the message?

The concern is not only about what happened last week but the cart before the horse approach that has been taken to the reconfiguration of health services in the mid-west.  I thank the Minister for being present to reply to this matter that I and my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, are raising.<\/p><p>  Last June, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, warned that the emergency department at Limerick regional hospital was not fit for purpose as overcrowding there had reached critical proportions.  According to the INMO trolley figures, 561 patients were on trolleys in the hospital in September.  That is the highest figure recorded since statistics on this were first gathered back in 2007.  A comparison of the figures for September 2014 and 2013 shows a 60% increase, which is an alarming increase.<\/p><p>  I visited the emergency department at the hospital last Tuesday to see at first hand the numbers there.  Before I describe what I saw, I pay tribute to the dedicated and hard-working staff who have to work in such an appalling and stressful environment having regard to what they have to endure, day in, day out.  What I saw was disturbing.  It was not a pretty sight.  When I arrived, 23 patients were being treated on trolleys.  It was almost a nightmare.  Trolleys were lined up in the narrow corridors with family members gathered around their loved ones and many other patients were on their own wondering when a bed would become available.  There was no dignity afforded to patients and little room for staff to treat them.  It was bordering on unsafe.  My thoughts turned immediately to the previous day when 50 patients were being treated on trolleys.  I saw the emergency department when there were 23 patients on trolleys and it was a nightmare.  At 7.30 a.m. on the previous Monday, 50 patients being treated on trolleys in the emergency department and they were waiting to be admitted.<\/p><p>  The alarm bells are ringing on this issue.  That is the reason Deputy O'Donnell and I are raising this issue.  The trolley figures are a concern.  Having regard to what happened throughout the summer with high trolley figures and with the influx of patients coming through in the winter period, the situation in the accident and emergency department will be unsafe.  It will have to be closely monitored.<\/p><p>  What would have happened if an emergency had occurred in the region on that morning where such a large number of patients were being treated on trolleys?  It would have led to a serious situation in the region.  I hope an interim solution can be found to the overcrowding in the department between now and when the new emergency department opens.  We have been told some spare beds are available in the hospital.  Will the Minister clarify the position with regard to the availability of spare beds?  When I was there I was told that there were no spare beds as those beds were being used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800025#X00300","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1412769900,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Varadkar for being present to take this matter.  He is fully aware of the difficulties.  I have had discussions with him in recent weeks on a particular issue related to the gross overcrowding at the University Hospital Limerick.  An interim solution is needed to this problem.  We know a new state-of-art accident emergency department will not be ready and open to take admissions until early 2016.  We have two winters to overcome between now and then.  My main concern is for the patients in the accident and emergency department and the staff working there and dealing with this persistent problem.  It has arisen due to the reconfiguration of services whereby 18 beds were taken from the accident and emergency departments at Ennis, Nenagh, and St. John's hospitals, the number of accident and emergency beds were almost halved to seven, and 17 beds are in operation in Limerick regional hospital.  The emergency department there cannot deal with the numbers coming in.<\/p><p>  We need a short-stay bed unit with 20 to 30 beds that would relieve the overcrowding and overflow from the accident and emergency department.  It would allow people to access the accident and emergency department with dignity and avoid people being treated on trolleys for hours on end.  People are entitled to such a service.  I am not looking  for anything new here.  It is fully recognised that there is a major problem in accommodating the current level of capacity at the accident and emergency department.  A new accident and emergency department is under construction and it is hoped it will be open in 2016.  We need an interim solution with the provision of a 20 to 30-bed unit.  As we approach the winter period, I hope an immediate solution will be found to address this problem and that beds will be made available to ensure the accident and emergency department can function in a normal way both for the patients who attend it and for the staff.  I very much look forward to hearing the Minister's observations on this matter.  I know he has looked into the matter in great depth.  He commissioned a report with the HSE in this regard and I very much await his deliberations on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800025#X00400","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1412769900,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Breen and O'Donnell for raising this issue and for giving me an opportunity to outline in the House the current position on this matter.  In regard to trolleys, it is important to recognise that while there has been a deterioration in recent months in the number of patients on trolleys waiting to be seen, the situation throughout the country remains much better than it was in 2012, 2011 or during any period under the previous Government.<\/p><p>  There are significant pressures on the University Hospital Limerick emergency department which arise from the restrictions of the physical infrastructure of the department.  Many of these pressures were noted in the recent review by HIQA of the University of Limerick hospitals group.  To address this situation, an extensive capital project is under way for a new emergency department for Limerick which will open in 2016.  I understand from the HSE that there is no scope for speeding up this development without introducing significant risks for procurement, cost, health and safety.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, pending completion of the new emergency department, a number of initiatives are in place to help address the limitations for patients and staff in the emergency department.  In particular, a dedicated paediatric emergency area is now open.  This means children are seen separately in a child-friendly space.  In a major step for acute hospital services in the region, a new critical care unit has opened which allows for better patient flow for seriously ill or injured patients presenting to the emergency department.  The acute medical and surgical assessment units are open, and these take direct referrals from GPs and the emergency department.  A 17-bed short stay unit opened in April 2014.  This unit is managed by the acute medicine physicians and aims to complete treatment or assessment of patients within 48 hours of admission.  Three patient flow managers are in place who co-ordinate the transfer of lower acuity patients from University Hospital Limerick to Ennis, Nenagh and St John's hospitals to release capacity for emergency department admissions in the main hospital.<\/p><p>  All hospitals within the University Limerick hospitals group take part in a daily teleconference, chaired by an executive management team member, to discuss the bed situation across the group.  The group is raising awareness among GPs and the public about the local injury units in the other hospitals in order that patients can make better use of these.  They will be seen much quicker if they have minor injury and they go to Nenagh or Ennis hospital.<\/p><p>   In parallel with these measures, the special delivery unit will support the University of Limerick hospitals group, with interim and long-term sustainable solutions to deal with bed capacity, excessive trolley waits and overcrowding in the emergency department.<\/p><p>Analysis by the SDU indicates a requirement for additional bed capacity at UHL.  The hospital and the HSE are in discussions about increasing capacity on the hospital site, with a range of measures being considered in the 2015 service plan process.  This process must take account of the financial constraints facing the hospital and the HSE's budgetary limitations next year.<\/p><p> At a national level, the HSE is establishing a winter planning group, with representation from social care and acute hospitals.  The group will identify immediate actions to address winter pressures in acute care.  It will also examine medium term plans for delivering sustainable solutions.  The SDU will also participate in this exercise.  I look forward to the ongoing development of emergency services in the Limerick group, both in terms of the new facilities and modernising the way in which these services are provided.  These will be of significant and lasting benefit to patients in the region and to UHL staff.<\/p><p> While there is a serious problem, as referred to by Deputy Breen, with 47 patients on trolleys on Monday, 29 September, requiring emergency action, yesterday morning at 8 a.m. there were six people on trolleys in the entire hospital, only one of whom had been waiting longer than nine hours.  This morning there were ten people on trolleys, only six of whom had been waiting for nine hours.  For whatever reason, the situation is the best it has been in several weeks, which is encouraging.  It is of concern that UL hospital group is 16% over budget.  It is more over budget than any hospital group in the country.  Spending is up, not down, and while one might be able to justify higher spending if we were seeing shorter waiting lists and fewer people on trolleys, it is very disturbing to see a hospital group with an increasing budget overrunning its budget but not achieving the goals that patients would expect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800025#X00500","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412770500,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply and am glad to hear the hospital and HSE are in discussions about increased bed capacity.

Some of the staff&rsquo;s suggestions on the day I visited the hospital included using the spare capacity in St. John's Hospital to establish a temporary geriatric accident and emergency unit or the provision of a prefabricated building adjoining the accident and emergency department in Limerick.<\/p><p>  The Minister visited a hospital in Dublin some time ago and I suggest he visit UHL at some stage.  The number of medical assessment beds in Ennis and Nenagh hospitals should be increased by two in each hospital.  It is important the Minister listens to the staff, who are enduring the problems and who are stressed.  They were very stressed that morning because they could not move in the hospital.  I hope the winter planning group is meeting as we speak and that an interim solution will be put in place because we have heard the alarm bells over the summer.  The trolley numbers over the summer indicate that we will have a major influx of patients over the winter period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800026#Y00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1412770500,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I welcome the fact the SDU&rsquo;s indicator is calling for additional bed capacity at UHL in the accident and emergency department.  A number of interim measures are required.  First, the Minister should examine the existing hospitals in the network, including Nenagh, Ennis and St. John's, to see what additional capacity exists.  I understand a 20-bed unit in St. John's Hospital that was temporarily closed in recent months has been re-opened in the past 24 hours, which will alleviate pressure.  I would like the Minister to confirm that this is the case and that it will remain open to relieve pressure on the accident and emergency department.  A medical assessment unit in UHL could be converted temporarily into an overflow unit to relieve pressure on the accident and emergency department.  The requirement is for beds.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to the overrun, however this is a legacy issue from when reconfiguration took place.  Some 35 accident and emergency beds were in operation between Ennis, Nenagh, St. John's and UHL.  This was more than halved to 17 beds.  The new accident and emergency department being built will provide the 35 beds required.  This is a short-term, interim measure until the new accident and emergency department is operational.  The people of Limerick and the mid-west region are entitled to nothing less.  Can the Minister confirm that the 20 beds in St. John's Hospital have been re-opened to take the pressure off?  Will he continue to examine other initiatives regarding extra beds at UHL?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800026#Y00300","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1412770500,"counter":538,"content":"<p>The 20 beds that were closed due to a virus in St. John's Hospital have been reopened and this may explain the considerable improvement in the numbers waiting on trolleys in the past few days.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell said, a new emergency department is being built in Limerick, which will provide additional bed capacity.  While the HSE will consider interim solutions in the meantime, interim beds cost interim money and a hospital group that is running so far over budget will be further down the list for receiving additional funding and capital than those that are running on budget.  Increasingly we will pursue a policy of rewarding those who come in on budget, not those who overrun.<\/p><p>  I have worked in three emergency departments and have visited two since I became Minister, so I know a fair bit about them.  When I visited Tallaght Hospital, I was pleased to see how much better it was than when I worked there.  When I worked there, trolleys were strewn down the corridors and, thankfully, it is no longer the case.  This is not to say there are no problems.  Based on public commentary, one would not think things are so much better than they were three or four years ago, but they are.  I have received approximately 50 invitations to visit 50 different acute hospitals.  If I visit one per week we will be well into the election campaign.  While I will do my best to get around to as many hospitals as possible, it would be very na&iuml;ve to think that my walking around an emergency department looking at people on trolleys is going to solve the problem.  All these hospitals have CEOs, management teams and clinicians.  Throughout the country, better patient flow and management can considerably improve the situation.  The responsibility ultimately lies with the CEOs, clinicians and management to make best use of the resources they have before they seek more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800026#Y00400","speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","time":1412770500,"counter":539,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800026#Y00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1412770500,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for taking this matter, which was originally tabled for last Thursday.  This year, St. Christopher&rsquo;s Services in Longford celebrates 50 years in operation.  It was founded by parents and friends of people with intellectual difficulties and provides a community-based, high quality, efficient and innovative service to the people who use it based on identified, individual needs enabling these people, our citizens, to reach their full potential.  The centre is renowned locally and nationally for its excellence.  One example of the services it provides is Marian Avenue, a six-bedroom purpose built community home in Ballymahon, opened in November 2011, which is home to six people with varying levels of sensory, physical and intellectual disability.  Residents are supported to learn new skills such as cookery and money management by being an integral part of the daily activities of a household.  They are encouraged and supported to access resources and activities within their community.  They are supported to ensure their independence is promoted and developed at all times.<\/p><p>  However, St. Christopher's is facing a severe cash crisis and there is genuine concern for the future.  It could reach crisis point this year due to a deficit of almost &euro;500,000.  Almost 3,000 people &ndash; mothers, fathers, children and adults with disabilities, members of the business community and religious leaders &ndash; were out last Friday in torrential rain and bad weather due to the level of concern for St. Christopher's.<\/p><p> Since 2008, St. Christopher's has absorbed cuts totalling &euro;700,000.  The majority of these cuts were implemented through various efficiencies, but there are no more efficiencies to be made.  It is &euro;0.5 million in the red.  It urgently needs Government intervention to ensure that the HSE engages in a meaningful manner to ensure that this additional funding is made available so that St. Christopher's can carry on the good work that it has done for the past 50 years and provide a critical service for the service users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800026#Y00500","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412771100,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being in the Chamber today to take this important motion.<\/p><p>  The issue of funding St. Christopher's Services is my highest priority and close to my heart.  My mother, Mrs. Marcella Bannon, was on the founding committee 50 years ago.  She was the first treasurer of the association and she spent her lifetime fund-raising for St. Christopher's.  I have spent the past 35 years attending AGMs and supporting the services at St. Christopher's.  It is my duty to keep telling the Government how important the services of St. Christopher's are to the hundreds of families in the midlands who use the services.<\/p><p>  To understand how important this issue is, one need look no further than Friday last when 4,000, or 12% of the population of County Longford, marched through Longford town to protest about the issue.  I was proud to walk alongside the service users, parents and staff on Friday last.  After taking up this issue with the Taoiseach and the Minister on several occasions, I am again raising this serious matter on the floor of the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  Since 2007, St. Christopher's has absorbed &euro;800,000 in cuts.  Despite these cuts, it has managed to provide additional services and continue to provide top-class care for their service users.  The management and staff should be applauded for being able to achieve this when the purse strings were so tight.  The current financial deficit is projected to rise to &euro;470,000 by the end of the year.  This deficit has arisen due to the need to increase staffing levels to meet the needs and care requirements of service users.  These service users are a group of elderly patients, eight in Morlea House and six in Marion Avenue, Ballymahon.  It is my firm belief that the HSE is not recognising the changing needs of this elderly group of service users in these two locations.  If we cannot offer proper care to the elderly, we must look at ourselves as a Government and a nation.<\/p><p>  I am concerned that the Minister does not understand, or perhaps the HSE does not understand or accept, the gravity of the situation.  If this situation is not resolved, we run the risk of the HSE tendering out the services St. Christopher's for profit.  I do not want to see this happen.  The staff and service users of St. Christopher's, and the people of Longford, do not want to see this happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800027#Z00200","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1412771100,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Deputy Bannon can respond to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800027#Z00300","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1412771100,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I urge the Minister to act and let the staff of St. Christopher's continue the important work they have been doing for the past five decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800027#Z00400","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1412771100,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Bannon and Troy for raising this matter.

St. Christopher's provide disability services locally on behalf of the HSE that are subject to service arrangements which are monitored and reviewed at quarterly meetings with HSE disability management.<\/p><p>  St. Christopher's Services is funded under section 39 of the Health Act and is expected to receive &euro;8.24 million from the HSE in 2014.  Like all non-statutory providers, St. Christopher's is responsible for the management of its resources within the allocated funding.  The HSE has been notified by St. Christopher's of its financial difficulty, particularly in services at Marion Avenue, Ballymahon and Morlea House, Longford.  I have been assured by the HSE that it is working closely with the board of directors of St. Christopher's to address its funding concerns.<\/p><p>  A number of measures to reduce the funding deficit have been proposed and meetings are ongoing in this regard.  The HSE is committed to working with St. Christopher's to assist it to find efficiencies within its service and, therefore, come in on budget.  I have been assured that the HSE's priority is to support adults and children and their families who rely on disability services provided by St. Christopher's in the Longford-Westmeath area and to ensure that a sustainable service will be in place for the future.<\/p><p>  The programme for Government committed to putting national standards for residential services for persons with disabilities on a statutory footing to ensure that services could be inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  The introduction of registration and inspection represents a significant advance in terms of developing consistent and high quality services for persons with disabilities in residential services, including St. Christopher's.  The purpose of the regulations is to safeguard and support the delivery of person-centred care to vulnerable persons of any age who are receiving residential care services and ensure that their health, well-being and quality of life is promoted and protected.  This will empower providers to deliver even higher quality services in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800027#Z00500","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1412771100,"counter":546,"content":"<p>The Minister stated it is the responsibility of the management to work within the resources of the allocated funding, but this does not take account of the additional staff needed over the past number of years due to the debilitative nature of the patients in these houses.

I look forward to a positive response from him.  Templemore flood relief scheme is going on a long time and there is a long history attached to it.  I will not go into all the details, but suffice to say that a public exhibition on a proposed solution to deal with the flooding problem for the long-suffering people of Templemore was held between 30 January and 4 March 2009.  The Minister of State is aware of the difficulties flooding places on people.  There is not just the damage to property, inconvenience and the horror they experience at the time but the subsequent problems, such as lack of insurance and the real fear that it will happen again.  Flooding is occurring more often and must be addressed.<\/p><p>  Issues arose following the exhibition and on-site inspection, some of which related to landowners and commercial property owners in the area, and it was decided to review the scheme.  Following the review it was decided that the technically preferred route should be adhered to, but that did not happen.  Once the decision was made, further public consultation and another exhibition were required.  The exhibition took place in March of this year.  We were told by the Office of Public Works that a complete property owner review would be carried out, interference notice schedules would be prepared by mid-March 2014 and a public exhibition would be held at the end of March 2014.  In fairness to the OPW, it adhered to its timetable.<\/p><p>  The timetable also specified that confirmation would be obtained by the end of June 2014, a detailed design of works would be ready by mid-July 2014 and on-site work would commence in mid-August 2014.  That has not happened and I seek a reason for that from the Minister of State.  We were given assurances by the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor, Mr. Brian Hayes, and Mr. Michael Collins of the OPW, who announced the scheme at the then Templemore Town Council in 2011 to the great delight and relief of the people of Templemore.  The Minister of State and other senior officials came again following the review in 2013 to re-announce the scheme.  They said it was one of five schemes that was going ahead in the country.  They were delighted to state at the time that following the review and the option for the technically preferred route, the scheme had reduced from &euro;13.8 million to &euro;8.9 million and that it would go ahead.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister of State explain why the then Minister of State and the officials from the OPW told the people of Templemore that the flood relief scheme would go ahead when it did not and that, subsequent to the review, people were again told the scheme would go ahead but it did not?

I accept it is a very important issue to him and his constituents.  I had an opportunity to meet the Deputy and a number of residents in Templemore prior to my appointment to my current post and I know the importance of the issue for the people of Templemore.  Before I outline the detailed response to the question, I wish to make clear that as Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, I am fully committed, as is the OPW, to the delivery of the Templemore flood relief scheme.  The funding is in place and it is a priority project which will be delivered.<br\/><br\/>I will provide some background, much of which the Deputy outlined, but I will put it on the record.<b><\/b>The proposed flood relief scheme works for Templemore include the construction of a new bypass channel, along with road and property access bridges, flood defence walls and embankments, and some channel widening downstream of the town.  As Deputy Coonan outlined, the proposals were placed on formal public exhibition from 30 January to 4<sup><\/sup>March 2009.  Additional engineering and route complexities arose in relation to a section of a culvert that is a key element of the scheme.  Two alternative routes had been identified for this culvert section in the initial design stage of the project.  The route which was technically preferred would necessitate the demolition of a commercial premises.  While the other route would involve a significant impact on commercial properties, it would not involve permanent closure of the businesses.  For that reason, the latter option was chosen and shown in the proposals that were exhibited to the public.<br\/><br\/>During subsequent investigation, further information and details emerged on the costs associated with the exhibited route, including potential claims for compensation from property owners affected by the works.  There was also further clarification on the costs associated with the other, non-exhibited route, involving the closure of a commercial premises.  This new information necessitated a full review of the economic rationale for each option involving a detailed analysis of the comparative costs of the two alternatives.  The review took account of all likely costs, including construction and site remediation costs, property acquisition costs for the technically preferred route, and compensation to other property owners impacted.  Following the review, it was concluded that the technically preferred route should be proceeded with.  As that represented a significant change from what was included in the scheme that had been previously exhibited, the proposed alternative route was displayed to the public on 28 March this year, as Deputy Coonan outlined, and it was broadly well received.<br\/><br\/>In further developing the amended proposals, consideration was given to whether the full flow in the existing channel should be diverted into the bypass channel.  For technical reasons it is proposed that the existing channel will continue to carry normal flows and the bypass channel will carry flood flows only.  An issue also arose in relation to a combined sewage and storm water overflow pipe in the Church Road area of Templemore which is in the path of the proposed bypass.  The OPW is in discussions with Irish Water regarding works necessary to circumvent the pipe.  It is expected that this matter will be resolved satisfactorily and that it will not delay progression of the scheme.<br\/><br\/>The next step is that the amended proposals will be put on formal public exhibition, in accordance with the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  That will take place early in 2015.  Any observations received from the public or other stakeholders will be taken into account, as appropriate.  Following that, confirmation or statutory approval of the scheme will be sought from my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Pending completion of the exhibition and confirmation from the Minister, Deputy Howlin, it is not possible to state definitively what the timeline for delivery of the scheme will be.  However, the new scheme will be exhibited early in 2015.  The OPW fully recognises the need to implement the scheme for Templemore as a priority.  I, personally, and the OPW will do all we can to ensure the scheme commences as soon as possible.  To that end, if the scheme is confirmed, the construction work will be carried out by the OPW's direct labour force.  The decision will dramatically reduce the time required to commence the project because we will not have to go through a lengthy tendering process, which therefore provides an opportunity to claw back some time.<br\/><br\/>I can confirm that provision has been made for the Templemore scheme in the OPW's capital budget allocations for flood risk management to 2016.  The funding is in place and the scheme is an absolute priority.  We must get the scheme exhibited.  I am committed to doing everything I can.  When I visit Templemore with Deputy Coonan, it will be to unveil the scheme, which will have started at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800028#AA00500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1412771700,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I welcome what the Minister of State has said.<\/p><p>I also welcome the confirmation that the scheme will go ahead and money will be provided but I am worried by the fact that the Minister of State said that statutory approval for the scheme will be sought from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, after the review.  It seems we must get the Minister's assurance that this scheme will proceed.  It seems this is third time lucky for Templemore - there have been three exhibitions and three commitments from Ministers and officials at the Office of Public Works, OPW.<\/p><p> The problem is that people with homes in the area continue to suffer and the same goes for outlying areas.  The areas most affected include the Blackcastle Road, The Mall and Richmond but other outlying areas like Priory Demesne have experienced serious flooding.

The Deputy is correct that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, must give consent to this scheme, as I outlined to the House.  This is a normal process and consent cannot be sought until the scheme goes through various environmental processes and has been exhibited.  As far as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is concerned the funding is in place in the OPW budget.  The scheme will be delivered by direct labour force and this will enable works to commence more quickly than if the contract and tendering route was taken.<\/p><p>  I wish to outline for the record of the House some amendments that have been made to the scheme since it was originally exhibited in 2009.  Amendments included the embankments in the Ballyheane bridge area, which will now be constructed by Tipperary County Council in a separate scheme with funding from the OPW, and an alteration of the originally proposed culvert route.  Also, the originally exhibited scheme had over 800 metres of closed culvert and the new proposal includes approximately 191 metres of closed culvert with the balance being open channel.  The Deputy correctly said that the total cost of the scheme, including construction and various fees, is now &euro;8.9 million, approximately.  The next key stage for the scheme is to have it exhibited in early 2015.  I will keep in contact with the Deputy on this and I know he will keep the residents of Templemore up to date.  The scheme is funded and it is a priority so once it is exhibited I will seek the consent of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, which I expect to receive.  The scheme will commence as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800029#BB00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Airports","time":1412772300,"counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800029#BB00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1412772300,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I will start by providing background information to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to give context regarding the problem.  The technology park in Tralee was built in 2001 as an innovative hub, not an office block, and therein lies the problem.  At the moment a number of companies, including Aspen Grove, DCS Energy Savings and Donseed, have vacated the premises.  Unfortunately, Altobridge has gone into liquidation and will also vacate the premises.<\/p><p>  Initially it was envisaged that the facility in Tralee would be similar to the Digital Hub in Dublin and would allow technology companies to collaborate with each other, with the Institute of Technology Tralee, which is on the same campus, and with agencies of the State to promote, develop and create synergies.  Shannon Development was the initial owner and landlord - it looked after the Shannon area but has since devolved and now the Shannon Group exists.  Bizarrely, I am talking about jobs and a technology park in Tralee with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport - I cannot see how this fits.<\/p><p>  We are in a predicament wherein we have worked against the flow of State agencies for 14 years.  We could not give regional State aid similar to what applied in the Border, midland and western, BMW, regions but I am proud that I worked hard on this issue for the past three years.  We have achieved to the extent that we are now at a competitive foundation level that will allow Kerry to compete with other counties.  The crux of the matter is the Kerry Group took 800 local jobs to County Kildare so the focus shifted to the technology park.  When Shannon Development was wound down we considered whether the local authority, investors on campus or the Institute of Technology Tralee could take over the technology park and run it with synergies in mind and within the ethos of today's culture.<\/p><p>  I am referring to a conversation I had today when I say a person representing the biggest tenant, which has plans to develop, cannot convince senior management to commit to development investment in the technology park because it is not the same institution the tenant first bought into.  I can give the Minister the telephone number of the person in question.  Members of management of companies in the technology park are completely dissatisfied as it has gone from a digital hub to an office block.  They pay premium rents and it is not the same as the environment in which they first invested.<\/p><p>  Kerry Technology Park was supposed to be developed as a piece of infrastructure within Shannon Group.  The remit of Shannon Group applies to Shannon Airport and related activities so Shannon Group wishes to take business from Kerry Airport and compete with it.  Kerry Airport is a lifeline for Kerry Technology Park but the latter is owned by Kerry Airport's competitor.  If Kerry Airport sees a downturn the same will apply to Kerry Technology Park and Shannon Airport will benefit.  Surely there is a conflict of interest here.  I have seen Shannon Group's strategic plan and so have other Members - all of this is in the strategic plan.  There is a conflict of interest in the fact that Shannon Group is responsible for Shannon Airport and wants to take business from Kerry Airport while Kerry Technology Park, which is part of Shannon Group, is reliant upon Kerry Airport.  At the moment the technology park is the only place providing employment in Kerry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800029#BB00300","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speech","time":1412772300,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Spring for raising this matter and I know he has championed the need for development and employment in his county and constituency.  I appreciate the importance of this issue and know why the Deputy has raised it today.  The Deputy has given some background information on the bodies involved and, for the benefit of the House and the record, I want to make some points on Shannon Group and its role in Kerry Technology Park.<\/p><p>  The facility is owned and managed by Shannon Commercial Enterprises, which was formerly Shannon Development.  Shannon Commercial Enterprises is a subsidiary of the newly formed Shannon Group which was established as a commercial State company.  Therefore, the management of Kerry Technology Park is a matter for Shannon Group and Shannon Commercial Enterprises and I have no role in the detailed running of the business or its operational decisions.<\/p><p>  Following the recent enactment of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, Shannon Airport was separated from the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and a new State-owned commercial entity, Shannon Group plc, was established.  It incorporated two main wholly-owned subsidiaries: Shannon Airport Authority and a restructured Shannon Development, which was renamed Shannon Commercial Enterprises under the Act. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will recall from debates in this House that the rationale for establishing the Shannon Group on this basis was to support a new future for Shannon and the mid-west region, as envisaged by the Shannon aviation business development task force, which reported in November 2012.<\/p><p>An independent Shannon Airport, coupled with a restructured Shannon Development, has the potential to develop and grow passenger traffic and the route network.  A major consideration in this decision was the serious decline in passenger traffic at the airport in recent years.  In its first year as an independent airport, Shannon has succeeded in reversing this decline and is now focussing on growing passenger numbers.  The restructuring of Shannon Development and the streamlining of its activities is complementary to the growth of the airport business.  This restructuring involved transferring the part of the business related to indigenous enterprises and foreign direct investment to Enterprise Ireland and the IDA respectively.  In addition, the tourism part of the former Shannon Development's business was transferred to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  This restructuring laid the foundations for a more focussed role for the new entity Shannon Commercial Enterprises in managing and developing its property portfolio including the Shannon Free Zone adjacent to the airport.  Kerry Technology Park, among other properties, was also retained in Shannon Commercial Enterprise's property portfolio, in line with the restructuring strategy.<br\/><br\/>Since the enactment of the new legislation the newly formed Shannon Group now has a statutory obligation, under Part 2, section 10(1)(<i>b<\/i>), of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, to optimise the return on its land and property and on its shareholding in its subsidiary Shannon Commercial Enterprises.  Significant work has already been carried out in Shannon to prepare the ground for the group to be established on this independent statutory basis, and that effort and momentum must now be maintained if Shannon Group is to make a success of this enterprise, including the full exploitation of the commercial potential of Kerry Technology Park.  As I have already said, my role in this was to provide the legislative framework and the statutory footing to enable Shannon Group and its subsidiary Shannon Commercial Enterprises to do this.  I have every confidence in Shannon Group's capacity and commitment to fulfilling its statutory obligations and to meeting the objectives laid down for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800029#BB00400","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412772900,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I must point out why this is an unsatisfactory response.  I am glad the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is also in the Chamber because I have discussed this with him on a number of occasions.  The Minister stated the establishment of the Shannon Group was on the basis that it was to support a new future for Shannon and the mid-west region, as envisaged by the Shannon aviation business development task force which reported in November 2012.  I repeat this was for Shannon and the mid-west region.  I come from Tralee in the south west.  It is a two hour drive from Kerry Technology Park to Shannon Airport.  The focus is on Shannon Airport.  Kerry Technology Park is not a hangar, cargo house or shop in an airport; it is a technology park with many micro-businesses.  It was an entrepreneurial region of excellence, as defined by the European Committee of the Regions, in 2010.<\/p><p>  I find it farcical that more than a year and a half after I, along with other Members of the House, voted in favour of the legislation talks are no longer in place and we have bequeathed, or gifted, to Shannon Group an asset with a rental income.  It is now in a state of decline but it has no mortgage.  We gifted a cash cow to an organisation in competition with the area I represent.  I find this quite embarrassing on a political level.  The tenants are frustrated as they did not buy into this on day one.  There will be no increase of tenants there.  There is no existing relationship between Shannon Group, the enterprise boards and IDA Ireland.  Why are we looking at a model which has not worked anywhere else?  Its focus is on aviation, the mid-west and the Shannon area.  We have gifted it a cash cow.  This is a Kerry man joke.  We are giving it a couple of hundred thousand euro a year so it can clobber our airport in Kerry, which is its stated ambition in its plan.  I am quite fed up of it to be honest.<\/p><p>  I have been to the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, the Ministers, Deputies Bruton, Varadkar and Donohoe, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach with this issue.  It is not rocket science, but it is the only hope we have of creating jobs.  If people tell me they will not expand the number of jobs they have in Kerry Technology Park based on the fact the landlord they have is not the type of landlord they bought into on day one, we have a problem.  I urge the Minister to go about fixing it.  The Minister told me he does not have a statutory role in the organisation, but I have just read back to him what is the role of the organisation.  It is the mid-west and Shannon and not Tralee or Kerry.  There is a problem.  If the Minister wants to amend the legislation, I will be happy to work with him on it but this must be addressed.  If he discusses it afterwards with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, they will see the essence of the problem.  We must fix this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800030#CC00200","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speech","time":1412772900,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I will respond to a number of the points made by the Deputy.

This includes dealing with rogue employers who refuse to pay wages and refuse to comply with awards and decisions made by the industrial relations machinery; dealing with employers hiding behind shelf companies; and dealing with the completely unacceptable situation highlighted in Greyhound, where an employer can just change somebody's contract and tell them to sign it or go, which led those workers to being locked out.  We need improved legislation strengthening workers' rights in these situations.<\/p><p>  Another important area, which has been raised with the Minister a few times, is highlighted in the Rhatigan dispute, which has led workers to be locked out for six weeks, two of whom who have been occupying a crane for the past few days.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>They are alleging - frankly, I believe them - rampant abuse of the subcontracting system, the so-called RCT1 system.  The Minister may not be fully acquainted with this.  I talked to one of the workers involved.  He says that, along with a number of other bricklayers, he was employed by JJ Rhatigan.  Believing they were employees of JJ Rhatigan, five weeks later they had not been paid anything.  When they protested about this, some money appeared in the bank account of one of these people which amounted to all of the workers getting &euro;100 per week for the five weeks they had worked.<\/p><p> When he questioned what the hell was going on, he was told he was a subcontractor.  He said, &quot;What?  I'm not a subcontractor.  I'm not employing these guys.  We're just individual bricklayers who've been working for you for five weeks and believed we were employed by you.  You're now telling us we're subcontractors.&quot;  This bricklayer told me that he is not a subcontractor, has never been a subcontractor and does not want to be a subcontractor.  This is a flagrant abuse of the RTC system.  I have heard umpteen allegations of this kind of activity by big contractors.  They then wash their hands and say they are not their employees even though they know quite well that these people have been brought in and essentially falsely described and categorised as subcontractors.  That sort of thing is not on.<\/p><p> Those workers should not be sitting outside that building site, which is a public-contract building site for a school with public money going into it with this sort of carry on going on.  What will be done to investigate this activity which is rampant and has led to industrial disputes and will lead to more?  As the construction sector picks up, will the Government take action and introduce necessary legislation to deal with this rampant abuse of the subcontracting system?  Streamlining the industrial relations machinery will mean nothing if we do not strengthen the rights in legislation of workers to prevent these sorts of abuses and create a level playing field, which, at the moment, is heavily tilted in favour of employers, quite a few of whom then engage in rogue behaviour.<\/p><p> There are serious problems with what is in the legislation.  First, the potential for the adjudicator to dismiss frivolous claims is unacceptable and may even breach the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  As the professor of law in NUI Maynooth pointed out, people have the right to have their grievances heard and the idea that they can be dismissed as frivolous by a civil servant is not acceptable.<\/p><p> Second, the initial hearings with the adjudicators should be public and not private because public hearings act as a deterrent to rogue or delinquent employers and put pressure on them to treat workers properly.  If these things go on behind closed doors, there is a problem.<\/p><p> Third, a single adjudicator at the proposed Workplace Relations Commission is not good enough.  As I understand it, almost all sides of the industrial relations divide - lawyers, workers' representatives and employers' representatives - believe the tripartite system, where there is somebody representing workers, somebody representing employers and somebody who is a legal expert making an adjudication, is far more favourable than having one person, probably not qualified, making these adjudications.  As Michael Doherty, professor of law in NUI Maynooth, has said, a single adjudicator seems to be motivated more by cost-saving requirements rather than trying to come up with a fair, equitable and efficient system.<\/p><p> The legislation still gives the Minister the right to impose fees.  There should be absolutely no question of fees.  The provision for fixed-penalty notices of &euro;150 is a joke.  This will be the soft option for employers and allow them to avoid properly dealing with grievances, complaints and problems brought up by employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800030#CC01000","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412773500,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Workplace Relations Bill 2014.  I welcome the debate, as we need to improve the quality of life for all workers in the State.  I will support and welcome any serious reform proposals given that we all got elected in the last general election on the whole issue of reform and change of modern Irish society.<\/p><p>  I welcome that representatives of all employees were involved in the process, in particular the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which sadly seems to have been marginalised by the Government in recent years.  I would like to see a change of mindset from the Government and from the Minister present in particular.  We need to bring back and include the unions in many of these discussions about the economic future of the country.  Many of us are not happy with the current situation.  The Minister cannot come in here and talk about the Workplace Relations Bill while at the same time having an attitude and mindset that does not include people.  The days of exclusion have to end and that must be faced regarding this legislation.<\/p><p>  We also have the issue of the unemployed and low-paid workers.  They have been hammered in the past few years and they deserve our support.  They need to be given top priority in this debate.  We have seen the recent dispute with the Greyhound workers.  They work in a very difficult job, collecting waste around the city.  One morning, they were told their wages were being cut by 35% and there was then a long and bitter strike, which, thankfully, is over.  While this was going on, many of us wondered why the resources were not used properly and efficiently to end the dispute.<\/p><p>  We need to acknowledge the broader trade union movement and its particular contribution to Irish society.  I refer not only to the mainstream trade union movement and other unions, but also to the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, which represents unemployed people.  They also have to have their say on workers' rights and on these issues, particularly regarding women workers, many of whom are on low pay.<\/p><p>  Health and safety, and good relations with workers, are also key.  In particular, the safety of staff and workers is crucial.  Today saw approval for a &pound;16 billion nuclear plant which is to be built 250 km away from the Irish coast, which is unacceptable.  The safety of workers on that site and across on our island is very important.  I say to the Minister and to the Taoiseach that they should call in the British ambassador to inform him that we have an issue with a nuclear plant being built 250 km from the Irish coast.  The people of Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford are very concerned about this.  We should haul in the British ambassador to find out what is going on because this is a public safety issue and a workers' rights issue.<\/p><p>  Section 32 is designed to safeguard the wages and other statutory entitlements of employees who are working under public construction or other public contracts, while also ensuring competitive tendering and value for money in public expenditure.  While I agree with value for money and proper tendering for projects, I disagree with low pay and that needs to be faced up to.<\/p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned construction on the Kishoge school in County Kildare where all of a sudden the workers were receiving &euro;5 an hour, which is not acceptable in 2014.  It is an absolute disgrace.  When debating the Bill, let us also talk about these issues.<\/p><p>  The aim of the Bill is to create a modern, user-friendly, world-class employment workplace relations system that will provide significant benefits for its users and society as a whole.  The focus will be on resolving the workplace disputes as quickly and inexpensively as possible.  I totally endorse the aim of the legislation but we also need to focus on these issues.  We need to have workplaces that are happy and efficient, where staff are treated very well.  It is good for the economy and the country, but above all it is good for the people themselves.<\/p><p>  Earlier, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation said that he undertook extensive public consultation exercises, which I welcome because we need to hear the views of all the stakeholders.<\/p><p>If we are to build a world class workplace relations service, everyone must have a place at the table and an opportunity to have their say.<br\/><br\/>I broadly welcome the reform proposals the Minister has brought forward.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill reads:<blockquote>The services of the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) [are] to come together under the remit of the WRC.  The appellate functions of the EAT will be amalgamated into a reconfigured Labour Court.<\/blockquote>The memorandum further reads:<blockquote>The Workplace Relations Bill will replace the existing complex system of five different bodies with a straightforward two-tier system [of] employment rights and industrial relations disputes.<\/blockquote>This is a strength of the Bill.  It is important to rationalise these services and ensure they are delivered in a sensible way.<br\/><br\/>The Bill provides that the Workplace Relations Commission will deal with all cases in the first instance and the Labour Court will deal with all cases on appeal.  The explanatory memorandum reads:<blockquote>The creation of the position of Director General of the WRC will provide a single point of leadership rather than [the] four that exist in NERA, the EAT, the LRC and the Equality Tribunal.<\/blockquote>This is similar to what we in the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality have proposed in regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  To have one person directly responsible, that is, a single point of leadership, is very sensible and efficient.  It should ensure the job is done quickly, efficiently and fairly.<br\/><br\/>The explanatory memorandum reads:<blockquote>The [Bill provides for the establishment of the] WRC Board with responsibility for strategy and annual work programme.  This Board will comprise primarily representatives of employers groups, unions and equality bodies.<\/blockquote>I especially welcome this section which we hope will bring the unions and equality bodies back into the mainstream of society.  We must ensure equality issues and workers' rights are protected to the maximum.<br\/><br\/>The Bill also provides for &quot;[t]he transfer of all the existing functions provided by the LRC (including conciliation, workplace mediation and advisory services) to the WRC&quot;.  I welcome also the provision for workplace relations information and advisory services and, likewise, the indication that the WRC will be staffed by officials of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  There is not always sufficient acknowledgment of the excellent work done by these officials.  They are very committed public servants, but it is not fashionable or trendy these days to commend them.  I take the opportunity to do so today, being well aware of some of the magnificent work they have done in the public service.<br\/><br\/>The Bill also provides &quot;[a] statutory basis for the use of innovative measures such as Compliance Notices and Fixed Charge Notices to enhance the compliance functions of the WRC&quot;.  It provides for &quot;[t]he sharing of employment related and other specified information between the WRC, the Labour Court and other official agencies in the context of promoting compliance with employment legislation&quot;.  Additional members will be appointed to the Labour Court to facilitate the increased workload of the court under the new system.  That is another positive aspect of the legislation.<br\/><br\/>I understand the Minister proposes to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage regarding the powers of inspectors in respect of adjudication and enforcement.  The enforcement aspect, which is dealt with in sections 43 and 45, provides that non-compliance with an order of the WRC or Labour Court, as the case may be, will be an offence to be prosecuted in the District Court.  We must be careful not to end up in a situation where workers are imprisoned.<br\/><br\/>The provisions in this Bill will lead to savings in the region of &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million for the Exchequer as a consequence of the increased efficiencies that are achieved.  I welcome most aspects of the legislation.  We need to provide efficient services that will ensure industrial relations in this State are handled in a clear, efficient and professional manner.  I welcome this aspect of the Bill in particular.  We cannot have situations where disputes drag on for years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800031#DD00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412774100,"counter":579,"content":"<p>Deputies Se&aacute;n Kyne, Noel Harrington and Se&aacute;n Kenny will share time, with each having five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800032#EE00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1412774100,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill as a key component of the Minister's programme of reform of the State's employment rights and industrial relations machinery.  The Bill represents the culmination of several years of work in terms of drafting proposals, holding public consultations and bringing the draft Bill before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, of which I am a member.<\/p><p>  A worker involved in a dispute or with a complaint is faced with a confusing array of organisations, with the nature of the complaint determining which organisation has jurisdiction.  There is a lack of clarity at times in this regard, which is a problem given the stress and vulnerability often felt by workers in these circumstances.  The current system exacerbates the problem by prolonging the process and wasting resources.  There are five organisations with overlapping but separate objectives and operations involved.  This leads to workplace claims being pursued through the wrong channels or arguments being put forward on the wrong legislative basis.<\/p><p>  The best approach to resolving workplace disputes is one which does so quickly, fairly and transparently.  This Bill will serve to avoid the errors currently being experienced by all involved.  This will be achieved by replacing the five State bodies with two, namely, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and an expanded and enhanced Labour Court.  The commission will deal with all cases in the first instance while the Labour Court will deal with all appeals.  A further welcome reform is the replacement of the different positions in the existing organisations with a single point of leadership in the person of the director general of the WRC.  The new commission will be staffed by officials of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which will eliminate duplication.<\/p><p>  Colleagues and I, as well as stakeholders, have raised concerns with the Minister regarding the potential levying of fees on persons wishing to access the new workplace relations services.  I was encouraged by the Minister's response to my most recent parliamentary question in which he indicated that he does not propose to introduce charges on parties for access to the WRC services.  He is taking this approach for several reasons, he said, but largely on account of the fact a key priority in this reform programme is to improve access to the State's workplace relations services.  The intention is to ensure the reforms being introduced provide for an improved service in terms of cost-efficiency and user-friendliness.  That is welcome.<\/p><p>  This Bill could form a template for what needs to happen elsewhere.  I recently submitted parliamentary questions to each Department to ascertain the number of State agencies, bodies, working groups and committees under their remit.  I have received replies thus far from 12 Departments, with three others being collated.  The details provided vary, but the common theme is that there is a plethora of agencies and statutory bodies.  I understand the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is pursuing a reform programme and substantial work is being done by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and others in dissolving and amalgamating some of these entities.  Work remains to be done in this area.  There are 40 State bodies, working groups and service providers within the Department of Justice and Equality, 22 under the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, 18 each under the Department of Health and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, 17 under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, 13 under the Department of Finance, and 16 under the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p><p>  I am not seeking to denigrate the work done by many of these organisations, but I would be failing as a public representative and Member of the Oireachtas if I did not voice my concerns regarding the sheer volume of these organisations.  Collectively, they are allocated millions of euro of public money every year.  The people deserve the highest quality of public service delivered at the best value possible.  Without naming any entity, the attitude of some State agencies when contacted by public representatives is not good enough and is deplorable in certain circumstances, with responses ranging from clear irritation at being questioned to the provision of incomplete or less than accurate information.  In some cases, Members are simply ignored, without even an acknowledgment of their query.<\/p><p>  The signs for the economy are encouraging, with jobs being created and unemployment falling.  Such positivity is not an excuse to cease examining and scrutinising expenditure of public moneys down to the last cent.  This Bill is most welcome in that context.  I welcome it, too, because it will improve the enforcement of employment rights and access to non-court-based resolution processes, and because fees will not be levied on people who are experiencing problems in the workplace which have knock-on effects on their personal lives.  It is welcome because it represents what we campaigned for and pledged to do, namely, to ensure we have public services which work more efficiently and effectively for the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800032#EE00300","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1412774700,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of this Bill and acknowledge the good work the Minister has done in reforming legislation around the workplace and the general work of Government in ensuring that over the past year or two years, 70,000 more people are at work and on whom this legislation will directly impact and, hopefully, benefit.<\/p><p>  The Bill is to streamline the grievance process by merging the five existing State bodies into two, namely, the workplace relations commission and an expanded Labour Court.  As has been pointed out, the current system is complex, confusing, can often be expensive and, in many cases, deeply frustrating, in particular where awards have been determined but not adequately enforced.  An early resolution process should be determined by definite time targets, which I would like to see reinforced in the Bill, unless in exceptional circumstances where more flexibility could be introduced.<\/p><p>  The establishment of a director general accountable to Oireachtas committees is a welcome development but I would go further.  I submit that officer, or another officer, be directed to be a liaison officer for Members of the Oireachtas.  This practice would be welcome in respect of all public bodies and State agencies.  In areas where there would be quite a few inquiries from Oireachtas Members, maybe there could be a dedicated officer.  However, in this particular case, an officer could deal with specific inquiries from the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  I note board members are not to be paid, which is commonplace now.  However, when dealing with workers' rights, it is worth noting that board members will not be paid.  Could there could be a bit more flexibility in some cases?  Could the Minister's hands not be overly tied in this regard?<\/p><p>  I am concerned the adjudicator is not required to hold any legal qualifications.  Perhaps the Minister might point out what qualifications or experience should be set as a minimum standard for the adjudicator.<\/p><p>  As I pointed out, the current problems with the existing legislation is that it is overly complex, unwieldy and very difficult.  This new legislation might be an opportunity to compile and publish an online case book for employment cases similar to recent publications from the Office of the Ombudsman.  Compensation and award decisions and determinations should also be published online to increase transparency and the public profile of these two offices.  <\/p><p>  For parties who engage in the process, there should be an online progress report or an access portal so they could see how their cases were progressing through the system.  It is very difficult for parties to know exactly where they stand, whether in the commission or the Labour Court.  If something like this could be introduced, it would be very welcome.<\/p><p>  Currently, in regard to enforcement, only 11% of cases taken by NERA are successful in getting the awards for employees.  That is a very poor record of recovering awards.  We have an opportunity in this legislation to make it easier for successful parties to the process to re-engage with the court service and engage with the sheriff's office etc., to recover awards.  On that note, I very much welcome the introduction of compliance notices and fixed charge penalty notices to be levied against parties who are in breach of employment legislation.  The easier it is and the quicker it is to get resolutions and get awards paid, the better.  <\/p><p>  In regard to an employee who is not a member of a trade union or an employee who does not have the resources and would be discouraged by his or her circumstances from accessing the new redress procedures in this legislation, do we have an opportunity to make this legislation more user-friendly, such as providing an information or an advocacy office which an employee could access as a first port of call, and to engage in an information campaign so that the employee would be aware of his or her rights and the redress available?  <\/p><p>  Employees and employers should not be concerned about this legislation.  If the rights of employees are adhered to, one usually has a more productive and a better workplace and better workplace relationships, which almost always benefits employee and employers.

The Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal, functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and functions of the Labour Court will be replaced by the new workplace relations commission.  The functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be transferred to a newly expanded Labour court.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Government's decision to reform the existing employment rights and industrial relations structures because the current system for resolving individual disputes related to the workplace is wasteful in terms of State resources and those of the users.  It is also very frustrating for employees, employers and the professionals representing them.  The system that developed over the past 60 years had become unwieldy, complex, inconsistent, slow and, in some cases, expensive for users.  <\/p><p>  The aim of the Bill is to create a modern, user-friendly and world class employment workplace relations system which will provide significant benefits for its users and society as a whole.  The focus will be on resolving the workplace disputes as quickly as possible.  The aim is to create a system characterised by increased emphasis on and assistance with early and informal resolution of disputes.  One body, the workplace relations commission, will deal with disputes initially.  Employees with multiple complaints will have all complaints dealt with in one place at the same time.  <\/p><p>  Employers will no longer have to defend complaints in a number of fora and there will be one route and a time limit for all appeals as well as far speedier listing of cases for hearing and issuing of decisions.  There will be standardised procedures and timeframes across employment rights legislation and better and quicker ways of enforcing awards, which I particularly welcome.<\/p><p>  In addition to enhancing the service provided, the reform of the workplace bodies has the potential to reduce staff numbers and the associated cost of delivering the service.  It is expected that savings will amount to &euro;2 million per annum, mainly due to efficiencies and reductions in cost.<\/p><p>  The legislation will provide for the merging of the services of the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the workplace relations commission.  The Labour Court will deal with all cases on appeal.  The creation of the position of director general of the WRC will provide a singular leadership rather than the four that exist currently in NERA, the EAT, the LRC and the Equality Tribunal.  The WRC board will have responsibility for strategy and annual work programme.  The board will comprise primarily representatives of employer groups, trade unions and equality bodies.  The WRC itself will be staffed by officials from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  <\/p><p>  The transfer of the information provision functions relating to the family leave Acts will move from the Equality Authority to the new WRC and certain procedural matters, such as limitation periods and the length of time within which a decision made in the first instance may be appealed will be standardised across the full range of employment rights legislation.  There will be a new more robust and efficient system for the enforcement of awards under employment legislation and overall there will be better enforcement of employment rights awards and better compliance and enforcement of measures for employment rights, which I very much welcome.<\/p><p>  I have been concerned for some time that the industrial relations mechanisms of the State were overly complex and this new legislation will do a great deal to streamline that.  As a Labour Party Deputy, I welcome a far better deal and faster justice for ordinary workers where industrial relations issues arise and where outside assistance is required to find a resolution.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, has been working on legislation such as this since his appointment and his work with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, embodies this long-term commitment to the rights of workers and a better, fairer and more efficient set of industrial relations mechanisms.

As the Minister is aware, the current multi-forum system is unnecessarily complex and will be considerably simplified under the new regime.  Having one entry point for complainants will undoubtedly make the process more user-friendly.  However, on reading through the Bill it is clear that a number of very serious issues need to be addressed.  It appears that the new measures, which are designed to be cost saving for the State, may at times be costly to both the employer and the employee.<\/p><p>  My first concern relates to the workplace relations commission, which will carry out the first instance adjudication of complaints.  Section 41(9) indicates that proceedings shall be conducted otherwise than in public.  According to this section, cases in the first instance will be held in private.  That seems to be in contravention of Ireland's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 6 of which states that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing.  It is important to maintain confidentiality in certain sensitive cases but the default position of having private hearings creates issues for the transparency of the system as a whole.  What is the logic behind the provision?<\/p><p>  Section 41(11) implies that it is not the automatic right of an employer or an employee to have legal or trade union representation at their hearing. It seems that the default position is that there is no representation unless one applies for it.  It is important to bear in mind that these individuals will be in a position where they are navigating the exceedingly complex system of employment law, which would become considerably more difficult without any legal advice.  I wonder about the rationale behind that also.  <\/p><p>  Irish trade unions have no legislative right to be recognised in the workplace for collective bargaining purposes or to make representations to their employer through their union.  I have no doubt that can be a problem, but trade unions in Ireland would appear to have sold their souls in recent years by taking the big wages and not necessarily prioritising the worker's position.  I have also seen them take ludicrous positions against the employer just to be seen to be doing something.  Three years ago I had three cranes standing but because of the downturn I had to close one of the sites; I was forced to do that by a bank.  I was only able to employ two cranes standing so I had to let go the last man in.  He took a case against me in the Labour Court.  SIPTU spent money legally backing him and he was awarded &euro;25,000 against me, which was nonsense.  He was a very good crane driver and I would have given him work if I could but I could not.  I appealed to the Circuit Court and after two days I won but by then I had incurred many legal costs.  It concerns me that one will not be able to go to the Circuit Court in such cases.  One will have to go to the High Court, which may be a problem both for employer and employee given that the High Court is not an option for most small businesses or for the employee in most cases.  All of that does not change the fact that good, healthy trade unions are essential to a properly functioning democracy, especially when our democratic system repeatedly fails to represent those most desperately in need of a voice.<\/p><p>  The Bill will largely remove any use of the court in employment disputes, for example, the current right of appeal from the Employment Appeals Tribunal to the Circuit Court appeal under the Unfair Dismissals Act.  The only access to the court will be through a limited right to appeal to the High Court, which will only be allowed under a point of law.  Given the narrow basis for such an appeal and the significant extra expenses involved, in practice employers and employees alike may no longer have any meaningful avenue of appeal.  That raises questions for an individual's constitutional right to access to the courts.  The Minister might rethink that.  The costs in the Circuit Court are not anything like those in the High Court, and it is not as daunting for an employer or an employee.  I wonder about the rationale behind that.  I understand the Minister is trying to reduce costs for both employers and employees by cutting out some serious legal costs but when there are legal issues involved sometimes one is stuck with having to go through the legal process, and that should be available to employer and employee alike.<\/p><p>  From the point of view of employers, section 35(1) allows for the imposition of fines, fixed payment notices, of up to &euro;2,000 on employers.  It appears that inspectors will be allowed to impose them without any requirement for fair procedure.  Will it be possible for employers to appeal these fines?  If employers do not have an avenue for the appeal of a fine, there would be a considerable risk of abuse of the system.  I am not suggesting that every employer should be treated in a draconian way by the State because most employers behave in a responsible manner.  Sometimes an employer can have a fine imposed which he or she genuinely believes is unfair.  I may be reading the Bill wrongly but if there is not a form of appeal for such a fine, it is something that would worry me and it would be unfair.<\/p><p>  On the issue of money, the Minister stated that parties would not be charged for access to the workplace relations commission.  With this in mind, section 69 is confusing as it leaves it open for the Minister of the day to incur fees for using the commission.  We therefore cannot guarantee that this service remains free of charge and therefore accessible to all.  We may need to revisit the wording of section 69.  The Minister may believe it should be free but after the next election some other person might get his job and he might want to introduce a charge in that situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800034#GG00300","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1412775300,"counter":586,"content":"<p>God help us if it is you, Mick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800034#GG00400","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1412775300,"counter":587,"content":"<p>It is unlikely to be me.  I certainly hope this new proposed service will deliver but if it fails to do what it says on the tin, it will end up being just one more public expenditure cut - another measure to add to the undermining of the notion of the public good, which is a matter of public concern.<br\/><br\/>The neoliberals from the ESRI were prominent in the media this morning talking about big improvements in the Irish economic situation but there are some other figures that do not fit so well with the prognosis on the front page of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today.  At the back of the newspaper there was a piece by Professor Gerry Kearns of Maynooth University who highlighted that between 2005 and 2012, the average EU-27 number of those at risk of poverty has declined by 0.9%, while in Ireland we have jumped from 25% to 30%.  To quote Professor Kearns: &quot;It is clear, then, that a decade ago Ireland's poverty levels were at the European average whereas now they are considerably above it.&quot;  Perhaps the ESRI and the Government ought to start looking at different measures of economic success than GDP as it only seems to be serving those who reside in the higher levels of the income bracket.<br\/><br\/>The Minister said that he wants to introduce a world-class workplace relations service but he has not done much to improve the lot of working people.  He has done more to improve the lot of big business without doing the same for small and medium size businesses.  As the Minister is aware, I am involved in the small and medium size business sector and I would still argue that things are not so easy in our domestic economy for small and medium size businesses.  Unfortunately, we cannot help believing that large corporations have fared better than us in that area.  If the Minister is to give us a world-class workplace relations service, it should be complemented by an improvement in workers' rights across the board and a greater focus on the problems of small and medium size businesses in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>At the core of the Bill is the way a human right is delivered in Ireland, namely, the entitlement of citizens in the determination of their rights and freedoms to a fair and public hearing.<\/p><p>While this effort to move towards a less complex and dysfunctional system is welcome, there are surrounding issues which overshadow the entire process and not all of them are being addressed.<br\/><br\/>This coalition is a neoliberal one, which puts the interests of large business before those of the public most of the time.  Sadly, there has been a race to the bottom in terms of social protection, which worries me.  To quote Dr. Julien Mercille of University College Dublin, whose recent book would be worth reading for most people:<blockquote>... 'neoliberalism Irish-style' has borrowed elements of US neoliberalism, such as public-private partnerships, privatization of public services, low corporate and individual taxation, low level of government expenditures on social programmes and light regulation of the financial system.<\/blockquote>There was a time, before the rise of the neoliberal ideology, when one of the general functions of the State was to enforce the principle of equality among citizens and to combat discrimination at work.  It was also common practice for the State, when passing legislation or formulating policies, to take into consideration the effects its actions would have on the public sphere and work to minimise the impact of such actions.  Now, sadly, we do things differently.<br\/><br\/>Under this new logic, the market and corporations view labour rights and legal systems in effect as regulation, on a par with financial regulation, in short, as a barrier to doing business in a particular country.  It does not need to be this way.  The business community or employer can work very well in a healthy system where the worker also has protection.  I am all in favour of strong regulation and doing away with senseless, needless bureaucracy.  There is a big difference between regulation and bureaucracy, but sometimes people confuse them.  Bureaucracy holds everyone back.  We need to do away with as much of it as possible whereas strict regulation is important to keep things on track.<br\/><br\/>The French legal scholar, Alain Supiot, whose book is essential reading, stated in his 2001 European Commission report on employment that a hypothesis has been put forward, backed by a rigorous historical analysis, to the effect that our societies are heading towards unknown forms of re-feudalisation.  Judging by the present European legal framework, states no longer hold a monopoly over the definition of the general interest.  They must take account, on the other hand, of community authority and of social partners which regard themselves, for different reasons, as being entitled to establish law.<br\/><br\/>Supiot's 2001 prognosis has turned out to be extremely prescient.  Leaked documents from the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, trade deal outline how, after the trade deal is completed and put into force, a joint EU-US regulatory forum will be set up in order for representatives of the business community to have so-called transparency in relation to changes to legislation and regulation in Europe and the US.  What the 600 corporations who wrote the TTIP mean by &quot;transparency&quot; is that prior to the discussion of legislation in Ireland that may affect the profits of big business, the Irish Government and the EU must first give fair warning to corporations that may face losses to give them time to start lobbying against the legislation before it even reaches the D&aacute;il floor.<br\/><br\/>The Minister and I have had many discussions about TTIP.  There is an open discussion to be had on the matter.  The media is not having it.  It does not seem to be interested.  We should have it in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800034#GG00500","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412775900,"counter":589,"content":"<p>This is quite a substantial Bill.  It is in many ways a huge body of work set against the backdrop of dysfunctional industrial relations machinery in the State.  Since I have been elected and have raised cases brought to me, I am aware that in many instances people waited 84 or 85 weeks for an appeal hearing.  In an unfair dismissal case, justice delayed is justice denied.  That person would not have a snowball&rsquo;s chance in hell of getting his or her job back or anything like that.  None of us would disagree that the system needs to be radically reformed.  Is this the right way?  We need to consider it against the backdrop of the economy overall.<\/p><p>  I note the surveys produced in the past week that show we have the second highest number of low-paid jobs after the United States.  A total of 130,000 people here are in low-paid jobs who would like to be in full-time jobs.  There is an explosion of zero hour contracts which shackle people to their telephones awaiting a call to see if they can get an hour here or there.  The race to the bottom is alive and well.  There is a difference between injustice and illegality.  This Bill is the last port of call when a grievance or wrong has been done and someone seeks redress.  We should be considering how to create a climate where fewer wrongs are done and people do not have to seek recourse to the industrial relations machinery.  One of the reasons we are in this situation is that the trade union movement has, sadly, abandoned much of what it was set up to do and has settled for negotiating for a few crumbs from the table rather than championing the cause of workers in this State.<\/p><p>  I am a bit concerned about the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA.  It was supposed to be proactive in dealing with abuse of workers&rsquo; rights.  If we are to amalgamate it with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, how can it be proactive in workplace investigations and so on?  It is quite limited as it is currently constituted.  When the Greyhound workers came to us and we facilitated a meeting with them and NERA, the staff were incredibly professional in their desire to help workers and very helpful but they were hamstrung by the legislation as it was then.  An unscrupulous employer would very quickly find his or her way around NERA and box off responsibility by outsourcing unhealthy practices to a third party.  We have spoken about this in the House before, and scenes reminiscent of &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, with workers being picked up in car parks and no one knowing who they were or whether they paid taxes or anything.  I am not sure this new legislation takes on board these situations.  How can NERA&rsquo;s investigative, proactive role be protected when it is dissolved into a wider body?<\/p><p>  There are other areas that need examination.  One of the key problems has been the lack of enforcement of rulings from the industrial relations machinery.  If this legislation is to be effective, we need to stand that system on its head.<\/p><p>  There is a young man in my constituency whose story has been published in the newspapers.  There is no secret and he knows I am raising it in the House.  David Bell is 27 and was working for the multinational corporation eBay.  Mistakenly, he was brought into an investigation about fraud and PayPal, although he had no case to answer.  The employer reprimanded him for giving two &euro;25 vouchers to aggrieved customers, something the company did for dissatisfied customers.  Management said it was not appropriate in those cases.  He was brought into a meeting without any representation.  He was told he could not leave the meeting until he completed a written statement, parts of which management dictated to him and told him he could not have a representative present.  He was subsequently dismissed and the company described him as dishonest, unprofessional and fraudulent.  He took a case to the rights commissioner who was scathing in his criticism of eBay saying he was wrongfully dismissed and was subjected coercive tactics.  He said that eBay&rsquo;s position was seriously in breach of natural justice and fair procedure.<\/p><p>The rights commissioner recommended a payment of &euro;15,000 in compensation to the young man and the withdrawal of the dismissal letter.  That was almost nine months ago.  Nothing has been done to rectify the situation.  This young man, who is starting his working life, has not been given any apology or any compensation.  The letter has not been withdrawn.<\/p><p> This example could be replicated in many other cases I could expand on here.  If big companies are allowed to get away with this, what chance does a worker in a smaller company have?  What guarantee do we have that this scenario will not happen under the new arrangement?  I have a list of citizens from around the country who have had definitive judgments made in their favour by the State's industrial relations machinery, but have not got the money.  Unfortunately, I do not have time to go through all these cases.  The people in question did not get justice because their employers shrugged their hands and walked away.  If this legislation is to be effective, it is clear that we really need to address this matter.  We need to look at the whole system whereby people with decent jobs are being made redundant, only to be replaced by interns with low-paid jobs.  That is a bit of a sick joke that needs to be dealt with.<\/p><p> I am conscious of time, so I will conclude by speaking about an area in which something is lacking.  The Minister needs to address it because it has been brought to his attention on a number of occasions.  Many former employees are interested in being able to access the State's industrial relations machinery.  I refer particularly to those who were part of an employment pension scheme and are concerned about things that happened to the scheme after they left the employment in question.  Even though they have a very clearly defined and vested interest in that scheme, they are not represented by a trade union because they are outside the employment and, as a result, they have no access to industrial relations assistance.  The most graphic illustration of that problem is the Irish aviation superannuation scheme.  Almost 10,000 deferred and active pensioners in that scheme are facing an almighty hammering of the reasonable expectation they had about the standard of living they would enjoy in their retirement.  Under a process that is under way, the trustees are being empowered to change the terms of that pension scheme and an expert panel has been convened.  The deferred group and the pensioner group were both prohibited from participating in that process.  They could not access the Labour Relations Commission, which came up with the mechanism that is undermining their rights.  We know that organisations like the Retired Aviation Staff Association have put in place a system that gives retired workers vehicles to organise their interests.  A mechanism should be found in this legislation to enshrine access to these processes for groups of retired people whose standard of living is being affected.  Under the current airport scheme, pensioners are expected to lose six weeks' pay per annum due to changes they had no hand, act or part in.  I hope the Minister will address this issue in the final stages of this process.  If we are serious about the new legislation being of benefit to workers, much more work needs to be done on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800035#HH00200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412776500,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill, which has been in the offing for a long time.  It is probably a pity that the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation did not have a chance to discuss this matter further before the legislation was brought to the House.  I accept that it came before us in 2012.  Perhaps we could have discussed the heads of the Bill more recently.  I have always welcomed the amalgamations that have taken place.  All the way along, our objective has been to reduce the number of bodies out there.  In the 2011 election, we gave a commitment to try to make some sort of savings.  I am delighted to say that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has fulfilled that commitment on a number of occasions by providing for the amalgamation of a number of boards.  This is another example of that.<\/p><p>  It has often been said during debates on job creation in this House that people find it difficult to get funding for such purposes.  There is no one portal that they can look at and examine; instead, there are various sources of funding.  In this legislation, the Minister has decided to provide for a clear-cut process that will apply when there are difficulties with employment and employers.  This clear-cut road will involve the new Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  There is a clear outline of what will happen going forward.  Before today, people did not know what route they should take if there were employment issues for workers.  I hope this legislation will improve the efficiency of the resolution process.  This is important for workers who have difficulties with employers.  We are all talking about workers, but we should bear in mind that the employers who employ these people need to be able to resolve their issues with employees in a clear-cut manner.<\/p><p>  I would like to speak about an issue that has arisen on a number of occasions.  I always refer back to the attitude in Germany.  The National Employment Rights Authority is probably one of the worst examples of this.  I understand that section 32 of the Bill identifies the bodies that will be covered by the inspectorate.  It is important for a positive attitude to be taken when random inspections are taking place.  Inspectors should not try to find faults in employment situations where there might not be any faults at all.  Instead, they should praise the employers for the environments they have created.  When most random inspections take place, in the health sector or in the workplace relations arena, the inspectors go in to try to find something wrong.  More often than not, there is nothing wrong at all.  In certain circumstances, inspectors have a negative attitude when they go into employers' premises.  They should have a positive attitude.  If there is something wrong, they should work through it rather than going through the Workplace Relations Commission process.  It would be more beneficial if such common sense were shown.  We should encourage all sides, as long as the employer is in favour of it, to sort out the issue without having to go through the resolution process.  The inspectorate should take a much more positive attitude when it is doing inspections.  Rather than trying to find fault, it should encourage positive workplace relationships.<\/p><p>  How soon after the passing of this legislation does the Minister expect that the boards will be dissolved?  As he knows, one of the purposes of this legislation is to make approximately &euro;2 million in savings on an annual basis.  How soon will the boards be dissolved?  What sort of employment savings are expected as a result of this Bill?  The Minister has indicated that he expects more inspectors and other staff to be employed in certain sections.  Can he give us an indication of what the employment situation will be for most of the workers who are currently employed by these bodies?  Will the board appointees be nominated by the relevant bodies?  Given that we are removing a number of boards as things stand, will the board have a sufficiently broad spectrum to cater for the new role of the Workplace Relations Commission?  Will its new role involve oversight?  I know the Government sets policy, but will the board have a role with regard to the direction the workplace relations commission might take in the future?<\/p><p>  Before I conclude, I would like to comment on the deferred pensioner issue, which was raised by Deputy Clare Daly.  I have spoken about it here on a number of occasions.  I have been told that trustees are supposed to be responsible for all members of pension funds.  However, the deferred pensioners do not have the right to vote or to act as trustees.  Maybe we could look at that in the context of this Bill.  The workforce is very flexible at the moment - this is something we have encouraged - but flexibility can lead to problems.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>One problem is that people who have pensions associated with an employment have no say in their pension funds when they switch employment.  I have also raised this matter with the T&aacute;naiste.  Perhaps we could examine the possibility of allowing deferred pensioners some rights, for example, voting or appointing trustees to pension funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800036#JJ00200","speaker":"1053","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412777100,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important legislation which outlines some fundamental reforms of industrial relations and employment law.  I have concerns about the resources allocated to the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, and the inspection-enforcement area.  A few months ago, the Minister told me there were only 100 inspectors to police a workforce of almost 2 million citizens.  This situation merited an attempt to streamline and standardise the system of dispute resolution, but there is a concern that it has been motivated more by cost savings than by having better industrial relations machinery.<\/p><p>  Undoubtedly, the Bill involves a widescale and major reform of employment rights dispute resolution.  I hope the reform will lead to improvements in upholding workers' rights and their access to justice.  As I have done in recent months, many astonishing cases of workers being treated badly have been raised in the House.  Addressing these injustices urgently is a necessity.<\/p><p>  I welcome the creation of a specific section of the Minister's Department with responsibility for collective bargaining and small business.  I hope there will be a similar commitment on the part of the Government, which is at most in its final year in office, to progressing the legislation on collective bargaining.  The Minister might remember that it is nearly 16 years since I introduced the Trade Union Recognition Bill on behalf of ICTU and, in particular, SIPTU.  Sixteen years later and the House still has not addressed this important part of people's lives.  I hope the collective bargaining Bill will progress.  The Minister might recall the background to my Bill, namely, the disgraceful treatment by Ryanair of many of its workers in the mid to late 1990s.<\/p><p>  I have some concerns about the Workplace Relations Bill, especially that this major amalgamation may be driven more by cost savings than by improving the situation for workers hoping to have employment or industrial relations issues resolved.  I am also concerned about the loss of the tripartite structure for cases currently falling within the remit of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and how that may affect the resolution of these disputes.  I am similarly concerned about the qualification requirements for adjudication officers and the potential loss of expertise in not ensuring a significant number of these officers come from the legal profession.<\/p><p>  In terms of enforcement, I welcome the strengthened provisions for upholding decisions of adjudication officers of the newly formed Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the enforcement of compliance notices and fixed charge notices.  I am concerned, however, about the move to have the majority of decisions enforced through the District Court, which is already a busy system dealing with numerous issues and areas of law.  For example, the implementation of traffic safety laws in the District Court has proven difficult and led to a backlog.  There is a concern, therefore, that the same could happen in the case of appeals under this Bill.<\/p><p>  The Minister stated he would introduce amendments on Committee Stage.  I often wonder why a Department must introduce amendments to a Bill that has been in gestation for two and a half years.  This Bill saw widespread consultation, but one imagines the Minister would enter the House with the Bill ready to go onto the Statute Book.<\/p><p>  While I welcome the Minister's decision not to impose fees for accessing the WRC, I note that section 69 allows him to set fees for a second stage to the appeals procedure.  Separately, there will be a cost involved in having recourse to the District Court system for the enforcement of awards.  This could dissuade some parties, particularly workers, from taking that route.  SIPTU has suggested that the Labour Court should be expanded to extend its scope to cover the enforcement of awards, thereby incurring no cost for workers.  I agree with this view.  Given the Labour Court's expertise, it would be better placed to enforce the WRC's awards.<\/p><p>  The decision to have a new WRC as the body of first instance for employment related complaints and disputes as well as having inspection and enforcement powers is a good step forward overall with the development of the so-called one-stop-shop system.  The amalgamation of the appellate features of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into the new expanded Labour Court is welcome.  The basics of Part 2 are to be welcomed.  I note the functions of the WRC as outlined in section 10, and I welcome the establishment of the office of director general under sections 11 to 18, inclusive.<\/p><p>  I welcome the appointment of a registrar whom I understand will be the legal adviser to the WRC and the director general.  I question the decision to make the board of the WRC, the structure of which is outlined in Schedule 3, a non-executive board that reports directly to the Minister and the Department.  This could undermine the board's independence and could be especially difficult when, for example, the industrial relations arms of the new WRC are dealing with disputes concerning public bodies or publicly funded employers.<\/p><p>  The Bill provides for the standardisation of time limits for the institution of proceedings under Part 4, which deals with complaints and disputes.  Section 41 provides for a time limit of six months for referring a complaint or dispute to an adjudication officer.  This important feature should promote certainty for parties engaging with the new system.  It will also be easier to understand than the current system, which has multiple fora and differing time limits for taking actions under various employment legislative provisions.  I welcome the scope for the time limit to be extended to one year in certain circumstances where the failure to present the complaint or refer the dispute was due to what is called &quot;reasonable cause&quot; under section 41(7).  I also welcome the standard time limits in place for compliance notices under section 27 and fixed payment notices under section 35 of 42 days within which an appeal can be lodged against a compliance notice and 42 days within which the amount indicated under a fixed payment notice must be paid.<\/p><p>  I have an interest in the enforcement provisions contained in Part 3, which represent a key area.  I was involved in campaigning for the establishment of NERA.  I do not agree with IBEC's view that the inspectorate function currently exercised by NERA should not be included in the new WRC, as there will be an important pooling of resources and information between all aspects of the newly created umbrella body.  Another key issue of concern is the cut in the number of inspectors, which has come to my attention several times.  The Minister indicated to me last January that there were approximately 100 inspectors.  My experience has been that there is a need to increase this number, but one of the Minister's stated aims in his introductory speech was to save on staffing costs.<\/p><p>  A potentially significant measure in Part 3 is section 32, which provides for the disclosure of certain information in respect of public construction and other public contracts.  The explanatory memorandum reads: &quot;This section is designed to safeguard the wages and other statutory entitlements of employees who are working under public construction or other public contracts, while also ensuring competitive tendering and value for money in public expenditure.&quot;  A number of Deputies, including Deputy Boyd Barrett, have referred to the Greyhound workers' plight.  I was concerned about the issue, whereby workers were forced into accepting savage pay cuts by a company with a headquarters outside the State that was providing a key public service.  The Minister will remember how, when he and I were members of Dublin City Council, I led a campaign to keep waste management within the remit of the public sector.  I believed we would end up with the type of situation that has developed in the Dublin region and in which Greyhound has played a disgraceful role.  There seems to be no identifiable reason for the cuts to its workers' pay other than increasing its profits.  The fact this dispute occurred in a firm providing a service that should more properly have remained a State service is another disappointing feature of this Government's and the previous Government's lack of commitment to public services.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett and others have stated, the Greyhound situation illustrates grave deficiencies in the protection of workers' rights.<\/p><p> Separately, as the Minister is aware, I have raised many times, including publically in this Chamber just before the summer recess, the issue of serious potential breaches of workers&rsquo; rights on some sites operating under the school building programme.  This matter is evolving as Members speak and the situation has escalated in particular at the site at Kishoge Community College, Lucan in recent days.  I believe the Acting Chairman, Deputy Troy, also raised this matter one morning during Leaders' Questions.  As the Minister is aware, the key concern at this site and others is the use of the subcontracting system to erode workers&rsquo; rights and effectively reduce the price paid for construction services.  According to media reports, some workers effectively were being paid half the minimum wage for carrying out highly-skilled jobs like blocklaying, bricklaying or whatever.  I have referred this matter to the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, who I hope will revert with a substantive plan to address this problem.  In addition, this matter was raised repeatedly with the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, for more than two years, as well as with the present Minister, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, as the sites in question  are construction projects under the school building programme.<\/p><p> I have obtained figures from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, which show that between 40,000 to 45,000 workers have been registered under the relevant contracts tax, RCT, system in each of the past three years.  It is hard to understand why that system has been tolerated by the Revenue Commissioners, given that it appears to be open to grave abuse.  A number of trade unionists representing building workers have campaigned strongly to address this because the nub of the issue, as the Minister is aware, is that people who wish to be PAYE workers and who wish to be absolutely fully compliant are forced, against their will in a sham arrangement, to behave as though they are self-employed.  The vast majority of such RCT workers are registered as being within the construction sector even though the RCT system also applies to the meat processing and forestry sectors.  For example, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has informed me that in 2012, 42,420 of the 44,178 RCT workers were registered under the construction sector category.  Similarly, in 2013, 44,674 of the 46,431 RCT workers were registered as being in construction.<\/p><p> I also note that a private company, Contractors Administration Services, CAS, has been engaged to inspect the sites in question.  Workers have rightly complained that public bodies would be better suited to this task.  I understand this company specialises in auditing and accounting functions for building sites.  This function might be well-suited, with requisite skilled staff, to the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, which perhaps could best carry out such a function.  Perhaps this new section 32 therefore will have implications for the ongoing situation at these public construction sites.  It is vitally important that any potential illegalities or breaches of employment law are addressed.  However, the separate issue of the contractors on these sites relying on legal provisions of the RCT system effectively to opt out of having proper pay and conditions for construction workers must be tackled by the Government.  I refer to the greatly diminished public capital programme and hope that next Wednesday, the House will be presented with an expanded public capital programme, as it has been cut repeatedly since 2008.  However, while I commend the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, on his role in setting out a programme of school building, it has been highly remiss of the Government that on such sites, shenanigans are allowed to go on, one major contractor of which it is alleged being JJ Rhattigan &amp;amp; Company.<\/p><p> I understand the arguments made in relation to the RCT system.  However, the recent experience of workers on these sites under the publicly-funded school building programme highlights the difficulties within the RCT system.  It indicates that cost saving has meant that workers effectively are forced to become self-employed and thereby lose most of the protections and entitlements available to employees under employment law.  Consequently, the Bill being debated today cannot protect these workers.  Equally, by virtue of being self-employed, they will not have recourse to any of the revised and streamlined machinery under discussion.  I urge the Minister to work with his colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, to urgently resolve this issue in the interests of workers&rsquo; rights and ensuring the proper use of public funding.  In addition, I urge the Minister to work closely with Revenue to ensure the evolution of a system that is fair to those workers while expediting the public capital programme.<\/p><p> I am supportive of the provisions in the Bill regarding mediation, under section 39, to deal with disputes where this is agreeable to the parties concerned.  I note there is a move more generally in the context of all legal disputes to have recourse to mediation in the first instance.  The Minister will be aware that our local Northside Community Law Centre is now called Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation, which symbolises the welcome move towards mediation in legal matters.  It is important to have this reflected in the Workplace Relations Bill.  Importantly, however, mediation is not being included to substitute the right of either party to have the complaint or dispute resolved in another manner under the legislation, as is provided for in section 39(1)(b).<\/p><p> I welcome the general thrust of the provisions of the Bill.  I hope the concerns that other Deputies and I have raised will be examined on Committee Stage.  While I did tell the Minister that he should come in with a finished Bill, I expect him to listen to the committee as well.  What is unusual about this Bill is the Minister has told Members of his intention to table various amendments.  He could have made them before he came in and then other amendments that I and my colleagues might suggest on the Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation could be added later.  I acknowledge the Minister has committed to introducing those amendments.  Hopefully, this is an historic day in respect of the State's industrial machinery.  I wish the Minister well in the manner in which the machinery in its entirety is being modernised.  In particular, I hope it will not simply be grounds of cost that will influence this process and that adequate resources will be made available, especially to NERA, to ensure that our workforce - which fortunately again is approaching 2 million people - and in particular those low-paid workers in vulnerable situations to whom my colleagues, Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace referred, will be monitored carefully and protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800037#KK00200","speaker":"1190","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412777700,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Catherine Murphy, who proposes to share time with Deputy Pringle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800038#LL00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1412777700,"counter":596,"content":"<p>Yes, ten minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800038#LL00300","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1412777700,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I probably have as many questions to ask as I have comments to make.  It is really important to have a functional and fair industrial relations architecture that protects the rights of both workers and, by extension, employers.  I note that many good employers will never find themselves in the position whereby they are obliged to call on such a framework.  However, one must guarantee fairness and equality in the economy.  It also is vital for employers and investors to know that when disputes arise, they will be dealt with in a speedy and just fashion and this is important for employees and employers alike.  I recognise the need for reforms in this area and the new streamlined architecture should deal with some of the waiting times and should make the process of dispute resolution much faster.  It only serves to have matters fester if someone is obliged to wait a long time to get into the dispute resolution architecture.  People very often feel quite aggrieved if they see high-profile cases demanding time while they are queueing for a similar service.<\/p><p>  The measures to improve enforcement and compliance with decisions also are welcome because there is nothing worse than getting a decision only to discover it has not been complied with.  I encountered someone the other day who is a F&Aacute;S supervisor.  I believe a Labour Court judgment was made some years ago on the supervisors, who believe they got a decision that was then simply ignored.  As F&Aacute;S no longer is in being - the supervisors are in SOLAS now - they have concerns and there is a difficulty in knowing who or what will pay their pensions.  It appears as though they are falling between two stools.  This kind of scenario should not arise.<\/p><p>We would be quite critical of it if it was a private employer but where the State is involved, we should be doubly critical of it.<\/p><p> We are not particularly good at building institutional architecture in this country and I hope the architecture provided for under this Bill will be good and will lead by example.  The HSE tends to be rolled out if one wants to cite a poor example of institutional architecture, but I am fearful that Irish Water might fall into that category as well.  Will the Minister outline the way he envisages the staffing and resourcing model operating within the workplace relations bodies, given the major change provided for in the legislation?  Far too often we set out with great intentions and aspirations to deliver world-class services, although we have been reasonably well served in this area, but often we have failed dismally in terms of the design of the vehicle that will deliver those services and in terms of resourcing them, which is just as important.  I note there is latitude provided to employ people and I would like to hear more about that.<\/p><p> The Minister said great efficiencies can be achieved by merging the functions of five bodies into two and that it is hoped this will take care of the workload, in respect of which there is currently a substantial backlog.  If five bodies could not cope with it, will two bodies cope with it any better?  It can be inefficient to have five bodies but I want an assurance there will be an improvement in the time it takes to process cases.<\/p><p> Did the Minister arrange for an impact assessment to be carried out of the changes being made?  If one was carried out, will he indicate what the findings of it were?  I understand the Minister will have latitude to hire as many staff as will be required under the standard Civil Service Act and the public service appointments Act.  Will he indicate if a staffing and resources plan has been developed at this stage?  We are all familiar with the public service embargo and how difficult it is to have that embargo relaxed.  While it is theoretically possible to do that, will it happen in practice?<\/p><p> It is expected the Labour Court will act as a court of appeal.  Will it require new members to handle the increased workload and backlog of work?  This appears to be provided for in the Bill.  Is that catered for and will it be provided for immediately once the legislation is enacted and the system begins to be put in place?  Will the Minister outline the new staffing for the Labour Court and how it will be arranged?  Can the expanded function of the court be achieved if there are not the required staff to carry out the support work?  The Minister will note that the last three questions are linked.  Has the staff structure been agreed with the merged entity?<\/p><p> I have received a good deal of contact on the area of pensions and in this respect I am sure I will be reiterating points others have made.  Many pensioners believe they do not have access to arbitration or that they are seen as being outside that process, yet decisions can be made on their behalf.  There are two high-profile groups of pensioners, namely, those in Dublin Airport and ESB staff, from whom I have received the most contact.  The issue is the right to representation and arbitration by retired staff in regard to their pension rights.  I have been contacted by many on this issue.  There was always going to be a problem with Aer Lingus pension benefits.  I remember the debate on the partial sale of Aer Lingus which was a hot topic.  The CEO of Aer Lingus appeared before one of the committees and spoke of the need to use some of the funds that were raised from that sale.  That was in 2006 well before the economy fell off the cliff.  Essentially, he made the point that some of that money needed to be put into the pension fund.  There was a difficulty before there was an obvious difficulty in the economy.<\/p><p> There is also a concern about pension benefits among ESB workers.  The central concern for all of those people is simply ensuring the right of pensioners to representation and arbitration through the industrial relations architecture of the State.  Given that the quality of life and income of former employees can often be wedded to the current managerial decisions of their former employees and the decisions of the State to impose, for example, pension levies, it seems the proposal they make has some merit.  If we consider what is happening in other countries, we will note it is not only here that argument has been made.  We know pension trustees have the power in certain circumstances to alter and restructure pension schemes in payment, namely, to allow for the imposition of the pension levy.  Bringing in a right to participation in arbitration would underscore the right of workers, which is existing labour law.  If we go back to 1974, pensioners had rights in this regard.  They had a right of audience and it was only after that time that this was dispensed with.  In Sweden pensioners have the same rights to express their views as active members in the pension funds provided they remain members of their trade union.  In the Netherlands the trend in more recent years has been for former employers or pensioners to be appointed to the governing board of the schemes as trustees.  They are not disinterested parties when situations arise where the income derived is to be altered.  I would be keen to know if the Minister would be open to considering such a provision by way of an amendment on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> Another issue is that we are told that many people are in the workforce but are not actually employees in that they are participants in schemes such as JobBridge.  It is obvious that such placements are a replacement of a job that should be provided.  We cannot talk about workplace relations and not mention that issue.  That scheme is certainly open to abuse.  I was given a good example of it today, which I will be bringing to the attention of the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p><p> Reference was made to a school building site in Lucan.  Construction workers did not want to have to get C2 certificates.  They did not want to be self-employed, rather they wanted to be directly employed.  That area needs to be tightened up.<\/p><p> There is a great deal of merit in the legislation.  I have concerns about the structure being adequately staffed to ensure it functions and that the delays in the system are removed.  There are some welcome reforms in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800038#LL00500","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412778300,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  Some speakers outlined that they welcome the streamlining of the complaints procedures for workers and workplace relations from five bodies down to two but I am not entirely convinced this is necessary.  I note the argument in favour is that there will be a simple procedure for an employee who wants to make a complaint and there is a single body and single point of contact for that.  I doubt very much that rationalising the structure to two bodies will speed up the process or reduce the length of time workers have to wait to have their cases heard before a two-body Workplace Relations Commission or the five-body Employment Appeals Tribunal, Equality Tribunal and the other bodies.<\/p><p>  On the Minister's commitment to ensuring the new Workplace Relations Commission has the resources to move swiftly through the caseload of work to ensure cases are heard within a reasonable timeframe, we will only see if that proves to be the case as the commission starts to do its work.<\/p><p>  It is difficult to move beyond focusing on the reason for the introduction of this Bill.<\/p><p>One of the driving forces behind the Bill is to save money and meet this Government's requirements to cut costs, at all costs, and to ensure that funds can be saved although bodies might be working reasonably well and satisfactorily.<\/p><p> I am unusual in that I have experience of the EAT and rights commissioners from both sides of the argument.  I have represented workers there and have also appeared before them as an employer.  Therefore, I have some experience of going through the procedures and I find the system very fair and good to deal with.  Coming out on the right side of the decisions makes it easier.  It works, and my only concern is about the time it takes to come before a tribunal or body.<\/p><p> Section 41 provides that the hearings should be held other than in public session.  This should not be included in the Act.  All the adjudications should take place in public.  The current system is quasi-judicial and takes place in public, and it should continue to do so.  In my experience in the regional areas, particularly in Donegal, there is no interest in the hearings.  While the proceedings are open to the public, nobody attends and the media does not turn up.  It is probably easier for a complainant whose hearing is held in Dublin to get media attention, given the concentration of media there.  The possibility of embarrassing an employer seems to be the rationale for seeking media coverage, but there is no great interest by the public in proceedings.  However, holding hearings in public is a reassurance for everybody involved and the principle should be retained.<\/p><p> Although subsuming NERA into the WRC might have some benefits regarding compliance notices and fixed-charge notices, I have doubts about the enforcement of compliance notices.  The Minister mentioned a fixed-charge notice fee of &euro;150.  This is not enough for employers found in breach of workplace legislation.  I wonder whether there will be any follow up on compliance notices.  In one case in Donegal, a NERA inspection found an employer had underpaid staff by substantial sums running into thousands of euros, but there was no follow up.  The employer simply refused to pay the employees the sums that were specified and it went on for a couple of years with no action taken.  Any body that is established must ensure that there is follow up on compliance notices and employers are forced to comply.<\/p><p> The relationship between an employer and an employee is unequal and employees need access to bodies such as the WRC and EAT in order to have their rights protected.  Given that very few employees are covered by unions, they act alone in looking after their interests and dealing with their employers.  While most employers attempt to comply with the legal requirements, many do not.  I know many hundreds of employees who do not have contracts, do not receive payslips and do not receive the minimum wage.  Employees need to be able to access these services easily.  Many employees do not have the benefit of having somebody to represent them when they try to assert their rights.  The system must be made easy for employees.<\/p><p> While it is not intended, there is a possibility that a system of charging could be introduced for the WRCs, which would be a very worrying step because it would restrict employees' access to the remedies.  It should not be implemented.  I am worried because some form of charging is provided for in the Bill and, ultimately, in a year or two, it will probably come in, justified by the workload, the number of complaints and the need to streamline the process and recover costs.<\/p><p> Another item that worries me slightly is the provision that an adjudication officer can decide that a complaint is vexatious or frivolous.  While I have no problem with such a decision in principle, it is open to the complainant to appeal the decision to the Labour Court.  If the Labour Court decides that the original decision of the adjudication officer was wrong, the case is referred back to the same adjudication officer.  It should be referred to a different adjudication officer.  It would be natural to the human condition that if one decided a case was vexatious or frivolous and struck it down, and it returned to one's plate, one would be prejudiced against it.<\/p><p> Much remains to be seen regarding how the Bill will work in practice.  The Minister should give serious consideration to ensuring the hearings are held in public.  The decision to hold them in private is a retrograde step.  He should examine some of the other changes.  The Bill requires a commitment by the Government to ensure the WRC has the resources to carry out its work.  This means getting away from the mindset of saving money.  An initial investment may be required to get it up and running and clear a backlog of cases.  As a result of the recession, many cases have come before the tribunals, over and above the usual numbers.  After the first few years, when the backlog has been cleared and it is running smoothly, efficiencies may be brought in.  However, there must be a commitment from the start to ensure the WRC can hit the ground running, do the job and deliver for employees and employers.<\/p><p> Under the existing system, many employers take a strategic decision to settle cases rather than fight them at the EAT because they perceive that the tribunal is biased in favour of employees.  I do not think it is the case, but that employers take a decision based on costs not to fight a case and to pay the employee off and make it go away.  The EAT can benefit employers and if they are proactive and fight cases, and have systems in place to ensure cases do not come before the WRC in the first place, it would benefit everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800039#MM00200","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412778900,"counter":602,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och go bhfuil seans agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.

We all had lives before politics, and no doubt will afterwards, when we were in other workplaces.  Given that we all have experience of being an employee or employer, we know the importance of employment rights, for both employee and employer.  If the rights of both were respected, it would lead to better work, better work practices and harmony at work.  In such cases, there is no need for any labour courts.  However, I am being utopian and the reality is different.  Although the principles of fairness and justice have almost become a clich&eacute; because we use them so much, they should be guiding principles of whatever we do.

The merger is positive.  Having five bodies does not make for efficiency.  It makes for confusion and lengthy delays and it also leads to resolutions not coming about in a timely fashion.<\/p><p> With new legislation, it is important to look at the view of stakeholders.  Most of the stakeholders were positive about the Bill.  Generally, they welcomed the broad reform, particularly for the single point of entry and the single route to appeal.  What also is positive is support for early intervention because there are too many examples of where a dispute has gone on for years as opposed to being resolved in a timely way.  The idea of mediation to try and solve matters at the initial stage before they escalate also has to be positive.<\/p><p> Some of the concerns raised relate to allowing the adjudicator to dismiss a complaint considered &quot;frivolous or vexatious&quot;.  That is something that is relative because what I might consider frivolous or vexatious could be something that is serious for somebody else.  When this is being discussed further, perhaps that will be taken into account.  The training for the adjudicator is also vital, as is the idea of transparency around the decision that is made.  This aspect is of concern because it does not sit easily that one person will decide that one's complaint is not worthy of a hearing.<\/p><p> A further point relates to where the complainant might have to make a written submission.  There are those, some of whom I know well, who have issues around literacy and where English is not their first language.  There have been examples in this country of foreign national workers treated appallingly by employers, wages withheld, passports withheld and no breaks during excessive working hours.  I would hope that there is provision in the Bill for such workers so that they will be represented and will have an opportunity to convey what is happening to them.<\/p><p> I was struck by the concern expressed by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation that a person with a grievance has a right to be heard.  As an aside to this, on ease of access for those who have issues, last night I attended a briefing, at which the INMO was also in attendance with others.  It was held by Patients First but it was on a similar point.  It was for patients with a grievance, that they would have a way that their voices would be heard.  It is not only workers who need that facility.<\/p><p> The use of the word &quot;dismiss&quot; is a little offhand.  A better word could have been chosen.  The word &quot;dismiss&quot; does not suggest that it has been an informed decision-making process where all sides have been heard.<\/p><p> There are differences of opinion around whether the adjudication should be in private or in public.  I disagree with my colleague, Deputy Pringle, on this aspect.  There is a need at times for a private hearing, particularly where the issue is of a sensitive nature.  We have seen examples where the media have latched onto a particular case and their presentation of it has not done the complainant any favours.  There must be allowance made for where there is a need for a hearing to be in private.  Overall, it is better to hold hearings in public because it enhances transparency.<\/p><p> It is positive that fees are not being introduced.  That is also beneficial to those for whom having to pay a fee would be off-putting.  There must be a system where those with grievances have access to the system which is there to resolve issues and money and fees should not be a barrier.<\/p><p> Returning to the issue of the adjudicator, I believe there is a need for three-person panels.  Such panels would protect those on both sides - those involved in the adjudication and the person whose case is being adjudicated - because there would be concerns around one person having so much say and responsibility.  I would hope that the matter would be looked at where the three-person team would be considered more fair.<\/p><p> On the issue of the legally qualified adjudicator, balance is needed.  There is a need for legal expertise.  One certainly does not want an increasing number of appeals because of the lack of legal expertise in the first place.  There are times when legal adjudication is required, but I am all for common sense prevailing.  Common sense is not rated highly enough here.  Sometimes common sense can be absent from those with degrees and letters after their names.  I hope that there will be balance in adjudication teams.<\/p><p> Enforcement is vital.  One can see measures on paper and think they are positive but it is only when they must be enforced that one can see sometimes the flaws and pitfalls.  In the past few years there have been abuses of workers.  At a certain point, for whatever reason, some employees who have given dedicated and loyal service over many years to an institution have become sidelined in their jobs.  In spite of that dedicated loyal service, their work has been diminished in such a way that they have been left with no option but to take redundancy.  These are persons with families, with mortgages.  Usually, the institution is losing all of that experience to employ others on a quarter or one third of the salary of that person.  In one case of which I am aware, the current options were not availed of due to what would have been a lengthy and onerous process.  I hope that this system the Minister proposes will be successful.<\/p><p> On the concept of decent work, I will move outside of Ireland.  We saw what happened in Rana Plaza and in other places in the developing world.  One may ask what that has to do with Ireland.  There are those in Ireland who are buying goods that are produced in slave-labour conditions and there are shops in Ireland which are also contributing to this.  There has been a campaign and certain shops have refused to take goods from such companies.  There is a role here of the Minister.  We must adopt the concept of decent work, both in Ireland and abroad.  The question has come up with the Minister.  When he is involved in trade missions, I do not see why the idea of decent work conditions is not part of the discussions.  We can lead by example by including that.<\/p><p> As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am aware that there is no difficulty in discussing human rights with the ambassadors and officials of countries where human rights have not been top of the agenda, and they take that on board.  Dublin Port is involved in a middle management work initiative with ports in African countries.  It asked me to speak at the recent launch and I made those points about decent work conditions because they make for much better relationships between employees and employers. There was much support around that.  On Friday, 7 November, there will be a conference in Dublin Castle implementing the UN guiding principles on business and human rights.  I hope that this Bill will be productive in the human rights of Irish workers but I also hope that the Minister, in looking at trade missions, will consider the human rights of workers in other countries.<\/p><p> What is important in the employer-employee relationship, and where there is a dispute, a conflict or a disagreement, is that there is ease of access to a resolution process, that there is a fair hearing, a prompt resolution, access to appeal and a resolution of that appeal, and that the language used is accessible to all.  There is a petition, being circulated by National Adult Literacy Agency, asking that the official business we do here is in language that can be accessed by everybody.  I hope the procedures the Minister is setting up will be fair and will be in language that everybody can understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800040#NN00200","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412779500,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies who contributed.  I welcome the broad support for the Bill, including from Deputy Troy representing Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy Mac Lochlainn representing Sinn F&eacute;in.  We have put a lot of thought into how we structure this and we believe we have done it in the best way.<\/p><p>  There has been a lot of work done, to answer Deputy Troy's point, in integrating the bodies and the staff within them.  A lot of preparatory work has been done on that.  Where we will be bringing in new adjudication officers, they will have to go through a training process to ensure that we get the quality needed.  To take up Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's point, they will be from diverse bacgrounds.  We are not confining it to legal persons.  We want to have a diverse range of staff because common sense is important in many cases.<\/p><p>What many adjudicators, namely, the rights commissioners and equality officers, have accumulated over a long period is a lot of common sense and understanding of the matters in hand.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked from where the savings will be derived.  They will come from the ability to have shared services, to process complaints more quickly and to have a single registration process and single forms.  It is all about streamlining the process.  We believe that will give rise to an effective process.<\/p><p> A number of speakers raised questions about the term &ldquo;frivolous and vexatious&rdquo; and the implication that if one did not like the cut of one&rsquo;s jib, one might decide to call a complaint frivolous or vexatious.  However, they are legal terms; they are not pejorative in any sense.  It is merely a question of saying that as far as the complainant is concerned, if he or she has no reasonable chance of succeeding, the law says it is frivolous to bring the case.  Similarly, it is a hardship on the defendants to have to take steps to defend something which cannot succeed, and the law calls that vexatious.<\/p><p> The current regime operated by the director of the Equality Tribunal provides a very good example of the effective filtering of complaints on receipt.  The tribunal has the power to dismiss a complaint at any stage if in its opinion the complaint has been made in bad faith or is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or relates to a trivial matter.  It is entirely logical that we would have a similar system as prevails in the equality area.<\/p><p> Other issues were also raised, such as whether we should have multiple persons at the hearing and if the hearings should be in private or in public.  The approach we sought to take is to make the process as simple and easy to use as possible.  We have long experience with rights commissioners and equality officers sitting on their own and giving out very reasonable decisions.  Holding the hearings in private is not in any way a breach of the obligations under the European Court of Human Rights because there is a right of appeal, and the appeal will be to a three-person body and will be held in public.  The Labour Court has immense experience and its judgments are looked to as major precedent.  The court has a very high reputation, not only in terms of fairness but in the legal argumentation behind its judgments, which means appeals are in very good hands.<\/p><p> Many speakers raised issues relating to individual disputes and, for example, the use of contractors which effectively put employees in the position of contractors, but they are not really germane to this legislation.  Some of those matters are for the Revenue Commissioners, but in all cases where NERA is called upon, it makes advice available to the individuals concerned and points them in the right direction.  Those roles will continue to be the case.<\/p><p> The issue of fees was raised on a number of occasions and this can be discussed on Committee Stage.  We have taken the view that fees should not be put in place.  Some argued for fees and others argued against them.  We took the view that we would not introduce fees except in the case where the first court of appeal was not used.  We believed that was a fair process and there ought to be a charge if a person refused to attend at the first port of call and then decided to appeal.  Otherwise we have not introduced a charge.  We are not closing out the possibility that there could be a role for fees.  It is prudent to leave the option in, but we have taken the view that we do not see the need for them, and if the system runs as we hope it will, the issue will not arise.<\/p><p> Deputy Mac Lochlainn raised the manner in which equal status cases will be dealt with under the new structures.  I assure him there will be no substantive changes in the Equal Status Acts under the new structures.  The Bill provides that complaints under the Equal Status Acts will transfer at first instance to the adjudication service of the WRC with appeals remaining in the Circuit Court.<\/p><p> A number of speakers raised employment rights issues.  The Bill does not seek to change the substantive law on employment rights.  Those are issues that are broader than the purpose of this legislation, which is to try to ensure the architecture is efficient.<\/p><p> Issues were raised that relate to fixed payment notices.  The fixed payment notice must be set in regulations.  It is not true that is &euro;150, as some Deputies suggested.  The amount will be set in regulations and can go significantly higher than that.<\/p><p> Deputy Wallace suggested it was unfair that there would not be an appeal for a fixed payment notice.  One is not obliged to pay the fixed payment notice but one is given a suspension of any prosecution during the period of 42 days.  While one has the option of making the payment of the fixed payment notice, if one does not, the case goes through the normal prosecution and is heard in the court and that position does not change.  To be fair to Deputy Wallace, he acknowledged that we do not want a highly legalistic process.  The Labour Court has a very strong record and is legally robust.  Deputy Wallace is entering the Chamber as I deal with his point.  He argued that there should be a further avenue of appeal to a court, following an initial case being brought to an adjudication officer and then on appeal to the Labour Court.  We are not anxious to go down the road of having appeals to the court.  We believe the Labour Court has a very high reputation in terms of the quality of its judgments.  It sets precedent and has expertise in dealing with labour law.  It will be the place in which the interpretation of the existing law applies.  If there is a dispute about a point of law, that can go to court, but such cases are not common appeals and do not relate to the cases cited by Deputy Wallace of which he has had personal experience.<\/p><p> If there is an unfair appliance of procedure, judicial review remains open to the court.  We are trying to create a self-contained, world-class, quality system that does not have recourse to the courts unless in exceptional circumstances such as where the system has broken down and people are not treated in the way they ought to be or where there is a point of law that needs to be tested outside of the box, so to speak.<\/p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the difficulties experienced in the enforcement of awards in employment cases.  I acknowledge the existence of such difficulties.  One of the main planks of the reform is to establish a new and robust enforcement regime which will provide successful complainants with an accessible and inexpensive means whereby recalcitrant respondents can be compelled to honour the award of the WRC adjudication service or of the Labour Court, as the case may be.  That is a matter for further discussion between ourselves and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, and the Attorney General.  I hope to be able to table amendments at a later stage in those areas.<\/p><p> Deputy Finian McGrath made the case for more social dialogue.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Social partnership does not exist as it did in the past but social dialogue is very active and there has been much dialogue on this Bill and the action plan for jobs.  We are open to the views of all bodies on issues of policy in the Department and we try to ensure all voices are heard.<\/p><p> Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne made the point that there has been improvement and this is not the time to lower our interest in reform.  I agree with that point.<\/p><p> Deputy Noel Harrington raised issues on time targets for early resolution and we can examine this but early resolution, by its nature, offers a narrow window during which resolution can be sought.  I do not know whether statutory time limits can be set on this because it is essentially a voluntary process that people enter and can withdraw from at any stage.  The Deputy referred to an Oireachtas liaison officer but I do not know whether the level of queries is sufficient to justify such a measure under the WRC - we will consider it.  The Deputy also raised the poor recovery rates associated with NERA and we aim to raise these.  I will not be drawn into a discussion of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP while debating the Workplace Relations Bill, though it would be interesting.<\/p><p> We will continue to deal with issues on Committee Stage.  Deputy Thomas P. Broughan referred to the issue of a non-executive board but the role has not been downgraded and members will deal with strategy - their independence will not be undermined should the WRC deal with a public body.  There are many non-executive boards and the key point in this case is the difference between an office of the Department and an agency of the Department.  The Office of Corporate Enforcement and NERA are offices of the Department but they are independent bodies - the fact that they are offices under a Minister does not mean the Minister supervises the decision-making process.<\/p><p> Deputy Anthony Lawlor asked when the WRC will be established and the other agencies dissolved and this depends on the passage through the legislative process.  We are in the hands of the Oireachtas but are keen to move as quickly as possible, subject to allowing Members enough time to fully consider the proposals.<\/p><p> Deputies Catherine Murphy and Pringle wanted to be assured that two agencies will be better than five.  It is not simply a matter of numbers - there will no longer be multiple applications relating to the same complaint to a number of different bodies as this was wasteful in the use of resources, contributed to a lack of clarity and led to inconsistencies in how issues were treated.  There were long delays too.  This is not simply a case of reducing the number of entities from five to two - it is a case of having a first instance body and an appellate body.  We aim to make the process simple and easy to understand.  Many people spoke of the need for a compliance culture and this legislation will encourage that.  Deputy Anthony Lawlor asked whether an inspection should seek to encourage compliance or be a case of going in all guns blazing.  Clearly, we want to encourage compliance and this is why there will be compliance notices and the like to give people an opportunity to mend their hands.  We will not be soft on those who are determined not to honour their obligations - a balance must be struck.  The earlier a case is resolved, the better - ideally, some cases will not arise at all thanks to this legislation.<\/p><p> I have addressed the main issues that were raised.  I thank the Members for their detailed consideration and thoughtful contributions came from all sides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800041#OO00200","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412780700,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the matter of an appeals system relating to fines on employers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800043#QQ00200","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1412780700,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I dealt with that already.

Protecting children from harmful tobacco products has long been a priority for me, both as Minister for Health and in my current role as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I supported this legislation when it was introduced as a Private Members' Bill, developed and introduced by Senators Crown, van Turnhout and Daly.  In June 2012, I received Government approval for the principle of prohibiting smoking in cars with children present and for the drafting of amendments to the Private Members' Bill.  The Department of Health worked in consultation with the Senators, the Attorney General's Office, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on amendments to the legislation.  All of the amendments were accepted during Report Stage of the Private Members' Bill in the Seanad on 17 April and this included changing the Bill's name to the Protection of Children's Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Bill.<\/p><p>  The clock says I have ten minutes and 43 seconds left.  That is not correct, I have 20 minutes - though I may not use that full period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800043#QQ00900","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1412780700,"counter":615,"content":"<p>The Minister has 20 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800043#QQ01000","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1412780700,"counter":616,"content":"<p>The purpose of the Bill is to prohibit smoking in cars where children are present and it will be enforced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Environmental tobacco smoke is a carcinogen and contains the same cancer causing substances and toxic agents that are inhaled by the smoker.  There is no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke.  In children, exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke is a recognised risk factor for the development of asthmatic symptoms and increased risk of other illnesses such as pneumonia, bronchitis and middle ear infections.  Exposure to tobacco smoke is particularly harmful in enclosed spaces, such as cars.  Children's exposure to second hand smoke in cars is involuntary - they are unable to remove themselves from risk if people smoke around them.  This Bill is very significant, therefore, in protecting children.  I commend Senators Crown, van Turnhout and Daly for originally bringing this Bill forward.<\/p><p>  I will now take the Deputies through the Bill section by section to clarify its provisions.  Section 1 deals with the interpretation of some of the terms used for the purposes of the Bill.  For example, a child is defined as any person under 18 years of age.  The terms &quot;mechanically propelled vehicle&quot; and &quot;public place&quot; have the same meanings as laid out in the Road Traffic Act 1961.<\/p><p>  Section 2 sets out the prohibition on smoking tobacco products in mechanically propelled vehicles in which a child is present.<\/p><p>It specifies that a person who smokes a tobacco product in a vehicle in which a child is present shall be guilty of an offence.  This also applies in situations where the smoker himself or herself is under 18 years of age and is in the presence of another child.  Where this offence is committed by someone who is not the driver, the driver shall also be guilty of an offence.<\/p><p> The section does, however, contain defence provisions.  A defence exists where the person smoking reasonably believed that others present in the vehicle were over 18 years of age.  There are also defences for the driver.  One defence is that the driver was unable to stop the other person from smoking because he or she did not wish to take any action which might compromise the safety of the passengers.  Another defence is where it can be shown that the driver made all reasonable efforts to stop the other person smoking.  This section also states that where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is of the view that a person present is a child, then this presumption remains until the contrary is shown and proved.<\/p><p> Section 3 sets out the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Bill.  Where a member of the Garda believes that a person is smoking in a vehicle with a child present, he or she may ask the driver to stop the car, and demand the name and address of any person who may be committing an offence.  Where a person fails to stop the car, or to give his or her name and address, or provides false information, he or she shall be guilty of an offence.<\/p><p> Section 4 makes provisions for the issuing of a fixed charge notice in connection with offences under the Bill.  It specifies that a fixed charge notice may be served on a person where a garda has grounds to believe that he or she has committed an offence under the Bill.  The provisions, on which I will not go into detail here today, are similar to the standard operating procedure already in place under the fixed charge notice system operated under the road traffic Acts.<\/p><p> Section 5 deals with regulations, allowing the Minister for Health to make regulations for prescribed items in the legislation, for example, the form to be used for issuing a fixed charge notice under the Bill, and the prescribed amount to be paid under the notice.<\/p><p> Under Section 6, a person who is guilty of an offence under the Act shall be liable on summary conviction to a class D fine.  This includes an offence of refusing to stop the vehicle, refusing to give a name or address, or giving false information.  At present, a class D does not exceed &euro;1,000.<\/p><p> Section 7 of the Bill makes standard provisions setting out the Short Title of the Bill and arrangements for its commencement.<\/p><p> Before I finish I wish to remind Deputies that for five decades, the tobacco industry deliberately concealed facts about the dangers of smoking.  It disputed any link between second-hand smoke and poor health.  I ask Members not to allow for any manipulation of the truth.  The truth is that smoking kills, and that second-hand smoke is a recognised risk factor for the development of asthmatic symptoms and increases the risk of other respiratory illnesses and other problems.<\/p><p> I thank Senators for originally bringing forward the legislation.  Before I sit down I want to draw for the House the image of a child stuck in a child seat in the back of a car in a fog of smoke, to his or her detriment.  As a State we owe a duty of care to children.  As the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I owe a particular duty of care to children.  We must protect children from irresponsible adults who would expose them to such a serious risk to their health.<\/p><p> A newspaper article published today rightly points out the plain packaging legislation will face technical objections from some countries in the EU.  I had a phone call this afternoon from the Commissioner, Mr. Tonio Borg, stating the Commission has made no negative comment on the Bill.  It is important people understand this.<\/p><p> I commend the Protection of Children's Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Bill 2014 to the House.  The Opposition has been very kind and good in its support in the past and I look forward to its support on this also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800043#QQ01100","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412781300,"counter":618,"content":"<p>We support the provisions in the Bill and we welcome the fact it has made its way to the House so we can discuss its import and broader issues regarding the tobacco industry.  I welcome the Minister's remark that the Commission had no negative comment on the Bill with regard to plain packaging.<\/p><p>  I like to say I am constructive in opposition.  The Minister and I very often disagreed when he held his previous role, but I have always acknowledged, which may not make him feel any better, the efforts he has made in his fight against the tobacco trade and industry, including during the Irish Presidency of the EU.  It is important we accept the tobacco industry is quite insidious in how it targets people, and there is no doubt about this.  I have raised this issue in the House many times.<\/p><p>  As the Minister stated, for 50 years the industry hid the fact passive smoking causes physical harm to people.  It hid the statistics and facts regarding the impact of tobacco on the health of individuals and nations.  It hid the fact that for years it has flooded countries with huge amounts of tobacco so it can find its way into the illegal trade.  All of these things are done by companies registered on stock exchanges throughout the world.  The industry also hid the fact that in their advertising campaigns companies target young children in poor developing countries in Asia and Africa.  All of this is out there and must be acknowledged.<\/p><p>  I can understand the pressure a government can come under internally and externally because of strong lobbying, including at governmental level.  Clearly there have been moves afoot by some European countries to try to water down the plain packaging legislation which the Minister pioneered.  This in itself is an indication the tobacco industry has allies at very high levels.  We can understand why this is, as some countries have large numbers of tobacco-growing farmers and large companies manufacturing cigarettes which provide employment, but this should not deter us from doing what is right, and what is right is to ensure we make every effort to protect the health of our citizens.<\/p><p>  The Minister stated the Commission made no negative comments on the plain packaging legislation.  I hope we are not deterred from leading the way internationally in our fight against tobacco companies and the tobacco industry.  Our only motivation is to ensure our citizens have as much opportunity as possible to live a life without the pressure of addiction to nicotine and tobacco-related illnesses, which affect so many people.  According to the statistics almost 1,500 people develop lung cancer each year, and most cases are directly associated to smoking.  There are also many other ailments and illnesses and it also affects quality of life.  To be a slave to nicotine for all one's life can have a huge debilitating impact on one's self-esteem, finance and well-being.  This can have an impact on people fulfilling their lives physically and mentally and this factor should also be taken into account.<\/p><p>  For all these reasons any legislation or policy brought forward by the Minister to discourage people from smoking and encourage people to give up, and which takes the fight internationally to the tobacco companies throughout the world which have endless resources and, unfortunately, an endless supply of customers because of their nefarious ways of enticing young people to take up smoking, is something we will consistently support, encourage and applaud.  The Minister used the Irish Presidency of the EU very effectively to highlight the importance of the EU taking the lead in this issue.<\/p><p>  The statistics and facts cannot be disputed any further.  All empirical evidence shows quite clearly that tobacco is a killer.  It destroys people's health and lives.  Even this Bill is an acknowledgement that we must make every effort to protect people in our society.  The Bill is targeted at juveniles and young people.  The Minister asked us to think of a child strapped in a car seat with a fog of smoke.<\/p><p>A child strapped in a car seat in the back and a fog of smoke in the car is something that people now look at in shock and horror.  In a short time our society's behavioural patterns have evolved, including in the area of drink-driving and the wearing of seatbelts.  We need legislation to change human behaviour at times.  We need legislation to encourage and we also need legislation that is used as a means of changing people's perspectives of how they view certain circumstances.  It is now socially unacceptable to smoke in many cases and many environments.  Equally it must be socially unacceptable to smoke in cars when juveniles and children are in the vehicle.  That is why we are supporting the Bill.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the sponsors of the Bill on its inception in the Seanad: Senator Crown, an eminent oncologist; Senator van Turnhout, who has experience with children and child protection; and Senator Daly.  It indicates that when an idea has merit, it is embraced by the Minister and taken on board.  It is very welcome that it is now winding its way through the legislative process to its finality.<\/p><p> The Minister outlined the basic thrust of the Bill, including the principle of the Bill, the enforcement sections and the penalties.  As always in such areas, it is important to have an advertising campaign on the provisions of the Bill.  I believe that if the reason legislation is being introduced is explained in a coherent and concise manner, it always has better buy-in than if it is just passed into statute and we find enforcement without explanation.  I hope the Minister will be able to organise an advertising campaign around this.  When trying to change behavioural patterns, for example with recycling and safety on farms, if advertising campaigns are done through children they can have greater benefit than if they are done through adults.<\/p><p> On the broader issue of smoking, as I have mentioned earlier and in previous debates, we must accept that nicotine is an addiction.  People will go to enormous lengths and endure financial hardship to smoke and feed their nicotine habit.  I say that as a person who battles with that particular addiction and from time to time I fall off the wagon.  We must have supports in place for people who want to give them up.  I know the HSE has a helpline but we need to encourage people consistently to stop smoking.<\/p><p> In terms of policy, we have decided that we should continue to increase the price of tobacco products.  We have also decided to make them unattractive through the use of the plain packaging and also the graphic photographs on tobacco products.  Those are all very welcome measures.  However, at the end of the day, the fact that it is an addiction means that people need help to give them up.  Through advertising and promotional work we should target that type of message throughout stated health policy.  As opposed to using the stick at all times, we need to make people believe that they can kick the habit.<\/p><p> The tobacco industry is working insidiously in the background on how it promotes its product.  A very worrying trend based on the statistics is the number of girls who take up smoking, which is a key area to be addressed.  One does not need any statistical data to see kids leaving secondary schools and lighting up.  It is used in terms of making them look like Kate Moss or some other high-profile person.  This type of advertising is subtly fed out by the tobacco industry to imply that smoking acts as an appetite suppressant and one will not put on weight.  This is done in a very insidious way and has undercurrents all the time.  This highlights the levels to which tobacco companies will stoop to get another generation of people addicted to their products.  We need to be progressive and proactive in that area.  We need advertising campaigns targeted at particular groups of people to counteract the insidious message that comes from tobacco companies.<\/p><p> The smoking ban has been in place for ten years.  That is an indication that people can embrace something when it is explained and done for positive reasons.  This legislation is also done for all the right reasons.  I can see no downside reaction from people other than it can discommode people's habits, but it is done for many reasons.  The smoking ban was introduced as a workplace ban, but the people who benefited more than anybody else were the smokers because it reduced the amount they consumed.  Previously they could go into a pub, order a pint, sit up on the high stool and smoke 20 cigarettes.  The requirement to go out and come back in reduced individuals' consumption.  Anytime one cigarette less is smoked, it has to be of benefit.<\/p><p> The same will apply here.  Obviously, it is designed to protect children in mechanically propelled vehicles, in other words cars.  However, it will also encourage those people who would be inclined to hop into the car, reach for the cigarette and light up before driving off.  The legislation might start to change people's habits and anything that reduces the habit of tobacco consumption is very welcome.<\/p><p> The Irish Cancer Society and many other organisations that work at the coalface of dealing with people who have contracted cancer and other illnesses because of smoking all welcome the legislation.  It is generally welcomed across the board.  I hope the people will strongly embrace the legislation.  Garda&iacute; are obliged to enforce it, but before we enforce it we should have the advertising campaign on it to ensure people are aware of their obligations when in charge of a vehicle with regard to the health of juveniles and children in the car.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should then be seen to be actively encouraging compliance with the law after a period of time when it is bedded down and people are aware it is on the Statute Book and that it is illegal to smoke in a car containing a person aged 18 or under.<\/p><p> The broader issue we need to consider is that we still have a huge cohort of people who smoke.  We are all well aware that we have role models.  I return to what I said earlier about girls smoking.  In general boys have role models who are normally involved in sport, including soccer and rugby players, and where I come from they are hurlers and footballers as well.  They are normally very positive role models.<\/p><p> There is a key area for advocacy groups who advocate on behalf of children to try to ensure that we start to highlight our positive role models.  Referring again to girls smoking, we have wonderful sporting individuals, including the Cork ladies footballers, Derval O'Rourke and Sonia O'Sullivan.  We have a plethora of them from around the country - many of them happen to be from Cork, but I do not mention it for any parochial reasons.  We have a huge cohort of female athletes who could be critical to promoting a culture of healthy living among girls.  It is an area where we are falling down at present.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister can, as part of his remit, tap into the huge resources that are out there in order to convey a positive message to young girls about sports, healthy lifestyle and the fact that smoking is not and should not be seen as a way of dealing with other issues.<\/p><p> I commend the Minister on bringing the Bill through the Houses.  I hope it will have a positive and meaningful impact on our children's health in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800044#RR00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412782500,"counter":621,"content":"<p>It is proposed that Deputies Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Sandra McLellan share time.

It aims to create an offence of smoking in a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place where a child is present.  The initial proposal was to amend the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, before it was decided to introduce a stand-alone piece of legislation.  The Bill is the result of work undertaken by a wide group of people and I take the opportunity to commend that collective effort.<\/p><p>  In this legislation we have found something we can agree on.  The measures it contains might not go far enough, but I am satisfied that it is one of a raft of measures.  The Minister, Deputy James Reilly, has been addressing these issues in a very focused way for several years.  The provisions he brought forward on the plain packaging of tobacco products were recently brought before the D&aacute;il.  In tandem, these two legislative measures will save lives.  We have, at the same time, seen an intensification of the fight on behalf of the tobacco lobby, as referred to by the Minister, particularly around the issue of plain packaging.  Ministers have received letters from business groups in the United States and there were representations by up to 27 MEPs to the Taoiseach earlier this year urging him to drop the proposal.  We, as members of the Opposition and spokespersons on health, have also been lobbied in the same way.<\/p><p>  Recent years have seen a move to improve legislation and policy around tobacco control, the aim being to protect those who do not smoke from having to deal with second-hand smoke and help the many smokers who express a desire to quit.  Included among the latter is my esteemed colleague, Deputy Billy Kelleher.  We have seen the introduction of graphic warnings on cigarette packages and bans on tobacco sponsorship, the sale of cigarettes in packets of ten and confectionary that resembles cigarettes.  Ireland was the first country in the world to ban smoking in workplaces.  We must remain to the fore in this crusade by continuing to improve protections for the general populous and further aiding those who want to quit.<\/p><p>  The aim of achieving a tobacco free Ireland by 2025 - defined as a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5% - is to be commended.  Tobacco Free Ireland proposed legislation similar to this and also supported a social media campaign focusing on the risks to children from passive smoking in cars.  I note that Australia, Canada and England have banned or are in the process of banning smoking in cars where children are present.  Will the Minister indicate whether electronic cigarettes will be covered by this legislation?  While such devices might have a harm reduction role in established smokers, there is evidence that the emissions they produce may pose a danger to others.  We must ensure this Bill is robust enough to protect against any future similar tobacco or nicotine product that would create an unhealthy atmosphere in the enclosed space of a car.<\/p><p>  Much of the beneficial effect of this Bill will come from the debate surrounding smoking in enclosed places.  Indeed, the public has been made aware of this through media reports of the Bill's passage through the Seanad.  Forest &Eacute;ireann, the Irish smokers' rights group, has criticised these proposals and claimed they will have little impact.  I do not agree.  Even as we discuss them here, we further contribute to public awareness and knowledge of the dangers involved.  International studies in developed countries have shown us the extent of children's exposure to smoke in cars.  A 2009 Irish study suggested one in seven children in this country is affected by this type of passive smoking.  Extrapolating from that suggests that approximately 170,000 children are affected by this issue.  It is therefore imperative that we do something to address the situation.<\/p><p>  There is also the question of road safety.  A driver reaching for a packet of cigarettes and lighter and lighting up while driving, to say nothing of the distraction of having burning tobacco in one's hand, must amount to an unnecessary risk.  This Bill will go some way to denormalise this practice and thereby increase road safety for all users.<\/p><p>  Colleagues will recall the impact made by Fionn O'Callaghan, the boy from Wexford who wrote to the Taoiseach to ask him to bring forward legislation in this area.  In fact, he has been described as the inspiration for this Bill and Senator Crown brought him to the first briefing on the proposals.  In remembering Fionn in this instance, we must think of all those children for whom he was a voice - the 170,000 children whose health may be compromised because of this practice.<\/p><p>  For such an important Bill and one that has received such wide-ranging support, it is worrying that it has taken so long to come to this House.  It really is an indictment of our system that a Bill that is simple in the grand scheme of legislation and which might have a very positive effect should take this length of time to progress.  Ireland has been to the fore in limiting the ill effects of tobacco smoking.  We were told that the workplace ban on smoking could not and would not work.  As we all know, it has worked very well.  We were told it was a case of nanny statism.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is simply a way to protect those who do not wish to smoke from the well documented harms of smoking and help those who wish to quit.  In the case of children, we can no longer accept their being subjected to second-hand smoke and all the dangers it entails.<\/p><p>  I do not expect these provisions to impose an additional burden on the Garda.  For the most part, I expect the public will accept and adhere to them willingly, even before the Bill passes, in the knowledge of the danger such practice poses.  Efforts to effect the elimination of tobacco smoking are only one component of a raft of measures that must be introduced to improve the health of our nation.  In my role as spokesperson on health and children for Sinn F&eacute;in, I am often confronted with a grave lack of resources and many other basic problems surrounding our health services.  This is something that needs to be addressed urgently.  We must not, however, forget the role of preventative medicine and preventative legislation.<\/p><p>  I am sure these provisions will lead to fewer tobacco-related deaths.

Last week's Bill to introduce plain packaging on tobacco products was welcomed by Sinn F&eacute;in and we extend that to the Protection of Children's Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Bill 2012.<\/p><p>  Ireland is playing a pivotal role in the fight against the tobacco industry.  We are striving to create a smoke-free environment for future generations and this legislation will help with that.  A child should never be forced to inhale the toxic chemicals emitted by cigarettes when in any closed environment, especially one as constricted as that of a vehicle.  It is so harmful and dangerous to the developing lungs of all children, to their health and their well-being.  It is unacceptable for anyone to place a child in such a position.  Every provision must be put in place in order for us to make smoking as unattractive and unappealing as possible.<\/p><p>  The tobacco industry costs this State &euro;1 billion every year.  The HSE's budget, already strained by the impact of consistent austerity, must allocate this amount to tackle the effects of smoking on the population.  Heart disease, cancer, emphysema and other related conditions can be minimised with the introduction of such measures.  We can alleviate the budgetary constraints of the HSE with these measures and the resources could be allocated to other areas of our struggling health system.<\/p><p>  We live in an age where there is no excuse for anyone not to be aware of the impact of chemical dosed tobacco.  Awareness campaigns by the Government and organisations, such as the Irish Cancer Society and ASH Ireland among many others, have helped in this regard.  Recently, we saw the advertisement campaign rolled out by anti-smoking organisation, QUIT, featuring terminally ill Gerry Carroll, who has since tragically passed away as a result of smoking.  It was a tragic and untimely death that could have been prevented.  We saw the impact on his family and friends and I commend their openness and their willingness to highlight their plight.  He has saved lives. We must do the same.<\/p><p>  One in every two smokers will die from a smoking-related illness.  For every person who dies in this manner, the tobacco industry must replace them with a new customer.  The Irish Cancer Society estimates that the industry needs 25 young people to start smoking in Ireland every day to replace those who have tragically passed away or who have, thankfully, managed to quit.  Some 80% of smokers start smoking in their youth.  With a concerted effort through the smoking ban, the ban on branding on packaging and a ban on smoking in cars with children, this can be stopped.  We have a duty, as legislators, to do all that we can to protect vulnerable children.<\/p><p>  By designing an environment where children grow up to see smoking as undesirable, we can stop them wanting to take up the habit.  We can stop the tobacco industry from gaining new customers.  This must continue to be a priority for this and any future Government as well as for opposition parties and Independents.  We have a duty of care to citizens and must use the power we have to exercise it.<\/p><p>  Attitudes are changing.  Smokers must go to greater lengths to feed their addiction.  They must leave the social atmosphere of the pub and go outside for a cigarette.  They cannot easily light up in a hotel room and soon, I hope, they will not be able to casually smoke in a car with a child present.  We must remember, however, that smokers are not to be demonised.  Addictions across the board must be understood and helped in any way possible.  They are targeted by an extremely powerful, savvy, experienced and cash-rich industry.<\/p><p>  We are in the midst of placing as many barriers between the current and possible future consumer and that poisonous industry.  I commend everyone involved in the creation of this and previous Bills.  Education in schools from a young age can be used to highlight the fatal effects of tobacco.  Education designed to target mothers, fathers and guardians must show how passive smoking is just as lethal as first hand inhalation.  <\/p><p>  A 2013 report published by the Institute of Public Health in Ireland and the TobaccoFree Research Institute Ireland shows that while tobacco control measures are being successful, disadvantaged children are at particular risk of tobacco-related harms.  According to the report, this is due to their likelihood of exposure in the womb as well as to second-hand smoke in the home and, ultimately, to their own risk of taking up smoking at a young age.<\/p><p>  In the most deprived areas in the North of Ireland, mothers were three times more likely to smoke during pregnancy than in the least deprived areas.  In this State, nine year old children living in the lowest income families were twice as likely to be exposed to second-hand smoke in the home as children in the highest income families.  As of the time of that report, November 2013, approximately one in seven 13 to 14 year olds reported that someone smokes in the car when they are present.  The smoking behaviours of parents have a hugely significant impact on the health and development of children on this island.  <\/p><p>  Smoking in pregnancy was associated with adverse outcomes for newborn babies, including low birth weight.  GP attendances for chest and ear infections among infants were higher among mothers who smoked in the first nine months of their child's life.  Among older children, both active smoking and second-hand smoke were significant in terms of patterns of childhood asthma.<\/p><p>  The report highlighted the importance of continuing current efforts to make tobacco harder to get and less appealing to young people.  Investing in disadvantaged areas to give children social and physical outlets that are protected by the local council and that won't succumb to ruin is important.  Children in these areas more likely to smoke.  Is it because of a lack of amenities?  Is it because smoking is something to do to fill  time?  Is it a habit to pick up to appear cool among their peer group?  We have to further examine the causes and factors as to why those living in lower socio-economic areas are worst impacted by this industry and do everything we can to tackle it.<\/p><p>  Smoking is not only damaging to people's health but it also has a very negative impact on the environment.  From air pollution, to the decimation of 5 million hectares of forest worldwide, the tobacco industry is relentless.  Cigarette butts, in the early years of the 2000s was cause for 48% of litter on the streets.  The flushing of this litter into harbours, beaches and rivers is detrimental to marine life.  Cigarette butts take more than ten years to break down.<\/p><p>  We have already begun the process of eliminating branding from packaging, which is essentially the last method of advertising for the tobacco industry in Ireland.  The colours, images, words and designs used on cigarette packs are all used to appeal to young people.  Certain colours, such as silver and gold, have been proven to appear as though they have lower tar and health risks.  Slim, lightly coloured packets are used to attract young women while bolder colours are used for young men.  Cigarettes themselves are also used to appeal to young people.  In recent years, slim-line cigarettes have been designed to appeal to young women by making cigarettes appear glamorous and elegant.  Research has shown that when cigarettes are in plain packaging without branding, most young people find the packets ugly and boring and would prefer to take home a branded pack.  Irish teens begin smoking at one of the earliest ages in Europe.  We cannot allow this trend to continue.  <\/p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this Bill.  We would not like to say anyone unfairly targeted or criminalised as a result of someone forcefully lighting a cigarette in their car but it is very important that we tackle the issue of smoking in every way possible.  A child should never be exposed to the dangers of passive smoking and must be given every opportunity to live healthily in a smoke-free environment.  In the same way that mobile telephones are now prohibited to be used in cars, smoking can be a distraction to drivers and there is no real benefit to allowing anyone to smoke in a confined place with a child present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800047#UU00100","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1412783700,"counter":624,"content":"<p>The purpose of the Bill is to make it an offence to smoke a tobacco product in the presence of a child in a mechanically propelled vehicle, and a child is defined as somebody under 18 years of age.  I do not disagree with the substance of the Bill because we all know the dangers to health from smoking, and particularly for those who begin smoking at an early age.  We also know about the dangers particularly for those smoking in a confined environment such as a car.  The Minister outlined the various illnesses that follow such as pneumonia, bronchitis and ear infections, and he also made the point that children are unable to remove themselves from such a risk.  I know many cases where it is the children who are putting pressure on their parents and on the adults in their lives to stop smoking rather than the other way around.<\/p><p>  I do not smoke.

My colleague, Deputy Finian McGrath, would not be happy but I would be very happy to see a complete ban on smoking, and I support those initiatives that are trying to bring that about.  However, retailers with small shops are genuinely concerned that this plain packaging will fuel the illegal trade in cigarettes.  We do not know where the illegal cigarettes come from; there is a variety of suggestions in that regard.  We have no knowledge of the content, but there has been an increase in illegal cigarettes being sold, and in Dublin Central it is a major concern.  We saw the largest ever seizure of illegal tobacco in Ireland.  That illegal tobacco trade has to be addressed.<\/p><p>  I have a question about e-cigarettes, which are very common these days.  I understand, anecdotally, that they appear to be helping people come off cigarettes in terms of the nicotine but we do not know enough about the effects of e-cigarettes and vaping.  Is that another issue that has to be addressed in this type of legislation?<\/p><p>  On the Garda issue, enforcement is putting further pressure on already over-stretched and under-resourced garda&iacute;.  There is now another law they are being told they have to enforce.  We are asking the garda&iacute; to police something that should be obvious to parents, and I believe it is obvious.  In Dublin Central, we certainly need our garda&iacute; for other work.<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned protecting children from irresponsible adults who would damage their health but we are discussing the wrong Bill when it comes to children under 18.  From my involvement in the North Inner City Drugs and Alcohol Task Force, and with the projects working in the city and the city centre, the extent of drug and alcohol use is frightening, and it is beginning at a much younger age.  I listen to the frustrations and the concerns of the schools and the youth workers in this regard.  Their fear, and it is a reality, is that this problem is not being taken seriously.  Those in the youth projects are under strain due to the cumulative effect of cuts they have experienced in recent years.  There are far more serious risks to the health of young people than the one we are discussing, namely, them being in a car with their parents who smoke.  We have open drug dealing on streets in Dublin.  We have open targeting of young people to buy &quot;benzos&quot; and use high-strength cannabis.  What is being seen in the city is an increasing number of young people presenting with psychosis.<\/p><p>  Another issue of childhood health is the recent report on childhood obesity.  One in four are either overweight or obese, and we know that obesity will track them from childhood into adulthood.  Also, reports are showing a correlation between childhood obesity and children attending schools in disadvantaged areas.<\/p><p>  I attended an event this morning, mindyourmind, at which the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, was present.  The mental health of young people is not being addressed in the same way as this Bill is addressing one issue.  We listened to stories from young people of self-harm and depression.  We heard success stories also because there were young people who had the courage to go to an adult who would listen in an attentive and sympathetic way, and they found help.  Those are the issues facing young people.<\/p><p>  I do not object to this Bill.  I support it and commend those who have brought it to this Stage, with the support of the Minister and the House, but there are far more pressing issues involving the health of young people.

I will be giving a minority view but it is a view that should be listened to also.  When I first heard of this new legislation, I was annoyed at the intellectual arrogance of some of the anti-smoking brigade.  The reason for my anger was because most smokers I know would not dream of smoking in a car with children.  In fact, they would not dream of smoking in a car with non-smokers or adults.  We do it when we are alone in our cars and when we are in our own space.  Most smokers respect the rights of non-smokers, and that has been a fact since the introduction of the smoking ban.  We should get that straight first, and the nanny state brigade should give us all a break in this debate.<\/p><p>  I often wonder why they all get so high and mighty about ganging up on smokers while they often stuff themselves with alcohol, which is much more dangerous.  They should get off the stage and give us all a break.  The high morale ground brigade will drive smokers further underground, and that will lead to further isolation.  I respect their rights and, therefore, I expect them to respect my rights.  It is as simple as that.  We also pay our taxes; in fact, smokers pay many taxes to the Exchequer.  The Minister should ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, about that.  I believe the take on every packet of 20 cigarettes is in the region of 76%.  We should bury that money argument which I have often heard put forward.<\/p><p>  Before they all gang up on smokers, let us get tough on alcohol-related crimes.  Who is busting up our accident and emergency departments on a Saturday night?  It is not the smoker; it is the violent drunk.  I have seen that at first hand in our accident and emergency departments I have attended with senior citizens, friends and family members.  The people causing the trouble were either high on drugs or very drunk on alcohol.  Those are the issues we must raise.  The Minister would find smokers out in the car park, and now they are being shoved out onto the street to have a quiet smoke and mind their own business.  Once again, it is the soft targets that are being hit.  It is important that we be honest about that, although I accept that is a minority view around this House.<\/p><p>  We also have the issue of the illegal sale of illegal cigarettes, which is causing havoc in the State.

In some places one cannot even have a smoke in a public park.  The Minister needs to learn the lessons of life if he wants people to deal with the health issue.  I agree with the sentiments in the legislation because I respect the rights of children and of non-smokers.  The Minister needs to find other ways to deal with the issue.  Has the Government made a dent in the smoking population over the past ten years?  The figures speak for themselves.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan about the drugs crisis.  There is a major problem with drugs in this city, the violent crime connected with them, families destroyed by them and gangs intimidating families and whole streets.  I would like to see a sensible Government focusing on these issues, not just picking on the easy target, the gentle man or woman who wants to have a quiet smoke and mind his or her business.<\/p><p> This Bill was initiated by Senators Crown, Daly and van Turnhout.  Government amendments were accepted on Report Stage.  The Bill prohibits smoking in cars where children, those under 18 years of age, are present.  It is to protect children from second-hand smoke in cars.  I support that.  It is sensible.  Most of us smokers would do that out of respect for another person or child.  There is a small minority who would act arrogantly.<\/p><p> The legislation is to be enforced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the necessary powers required are set out in the Bill.  Will garda&iacute; be stopping people at traffic lights or chasing them around for having a smoke in their cars?  This is a waste of resources.  There are violent criminals and people dealing in dangerous drugs who should be locked up but are on our streets and the Government is going to target smokers.  Once again, the Government is focusing on soft targets, silly legislation, silly debates and silly solutions.  If a person commits an offence under this Act, he or she shall be served with a fixed-charge notice.  The amount of the charge is set out in the regulation.  The Bill also includes a presumption of age provision for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that is, if a garda is of the view that the occupant is under 18 years, this shall be presumed to be a fact unless the contrary is shown.  It includes the legal principle of holding the driver liable for smoking occurring in his or her car in the presence of a child, regardless of whether he or she is a smoker.<\/p><p> I have no problem respecting people&rsquo;s right not to smoke, to be influenced, or have their health affected by smoking.  The defences in the Bill are if the driver reasonably believes everyone in the car is 18 years, if the driver is not the person smoking but could not prevent a passenger smoking in order to drive safely, and if the driver, if not the person smoking, made all reasonable efforts to prevent a passenger from smoking.<\/p><p> There are many problems in this country.  Do we want garda&iacute; chasing people who are having a quiet cigarette in their car?  Do we want them to waste resources when there are other problems they could be dealing with?  I am dealing with many serious issues this week in my constituency involving violent criminals and families who are being intimidated.  Many of these gangs are up to their necks in drugs.  I would like to see the resources of the State targeted on them.<\/p><p> There are other ways to deal with the public health issue.  These solutions have been put forward in the debate on smoking.  We need to treat this as an addiction problem not by banning smokers or shoving us out in the cold or telling us to stay out in the rain.  What really galls me is people in pubs who are well over the alcohol limit lecturing others about having cigarettes.  Do they ever look at their own livers or alcohol-related health issues?  This is the kind of phoney intellectual arrogance that some people go on with and that we need to challenge.  The nanny state brigade must be challenged and told this is an addiction issue.  Let us deal with it sensibly as a health problem.  Banning electronic cigarettes is appalling.  We should help people to get off cigarettes if that is their choice.  The legislation labels smokers as irresponsible.  Smokers are taxpayers.  They respect their own children, their neighbours&rsquo; and friends&rsquo; children and children generally.<\/p><p> I accept that my view would not be popular but I never set out to be populist on this issue.  I give a minority view and any democratic society that does not listen to minority views is going nowhere.  The Minister should consider other options for dealing with smoking as a health issue.  He should be brave and radical and stop ganging up and beating up on people who are addicted to cigarettes.  Many would give their right arm to give up cigarettes and they try to do so every day.  Banning them, throwing them out in the rain or stopping them having an electronic cigarette to try to detox is not an acceptable solution.  That is not good or sensible health care.<\/p><p> We must focus on bigger, more important issues, such as alcohol and drug abuse and violent crime.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is dealing with gangland crime, drugs and intimidation in communities.  We did a great deal of work on this in the summer and will have hearings soon.  Some of the people coming to the hearings will tell us about the illegal trade in cigarettes.  There is a new subculture among those who were making money from heroin and cocaine and who find it easier to make money from illegal cigarettes.  The Exchequer is losing between &euro;500 million and &euro;600 million just when we need the money to invest in other areas.<\/p><p> I support the legislation, despite my views on smokers and the way they are treated, if there is a minority of smokers who do not respect the rights of non-smokers.  The Minister should get his Department and the Department of Health to work together to come up with sensible solutions.  People will always do things that are outside the box.  It may not be healthy or fashionable but that is part of life.  If the Minister enjoyed diversity and had a little more tolerance, we would have a healthier society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800048#VV00600","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412784900,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputies Harrington and O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800050#XX00100","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1412784900,"counter":632,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I spoke on another health Bill last week.  This legislation will bring us a step further.  It follows the commitment made by the previous Minister for Health to introduce legislation to ban smoking in cars.  That commitment was made following the debate on the Protection of Children's Health from Tobacco Smoke Bill 2012, which originated as a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad.  I am delighted to see that Professor Crown, who introduced that Bill, is present for this evening's debate.  He is listening to everyone who has something to contribute to the discussion on the important Bill before the House.  When this Bill, which will protect children, is considered alongside the Bill we debated last week - the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014 - it is clear that the Government is committed to tackling smoking.<\/p><p>  There is overwhelming evidence that smoking is the single greatest preventable cause of illness and premature death.  That is at the core of what we are talking about this evening.  Some people have questioned why we are tackling second-hand smoking.  In particular, they want to know why we are trying to ban smoking in cars when children are present.  All the available evidence suggests that being exposed to second-hand smoke is as bad for one's health as direct smoking.  Of course children are particularly at risk.  When people smoke cigarettes, not all of the smoke goes into their lungs.  It goes into the air and anybody who is near them inhales this smoke.  That is why we have banned smoking in the workplace, in bars and in restaurants.  We have successfully ensured people can enjoy a smoke-free atmosphere when they are out.<\/p><p>  The technical term for second-hand smoke is &quot;environmental tobacco smoke&quot;.  It has a combination of over 4,000 chemicals, which is a lot of chemicals to inhale.  The World Health Organization, WHO, agrees that 250 of those chemicals have been identified as causing cancer.  It has classed second-hand smoke as a cancer-causing agent.  We have to listen to the experts in this field, particularly the WHO, which has reported that second-hand smoking causes 60,000 premature deaths around the world every year.  A 2004 study by the WHO found that two fifths of children and one third of adult non-smokers were exposed to second-hand smoke that year.  I would like to put the WHO estimate that 1% of worldwide mortality in 2004 was caused by this exposure into context.  As a result of second-hand smoking in 2004, some 379,000 people died from heart disease, some 165,000 people died from respiratory diseases, some 36,900 people from asthma and some 21,400 people died from lung cancer.  In other words, approximately 580 people died every day in 2004 as a result of second-hand smoke.  We must listen to these statistics.  We cannot ignore these figures.<\/p><p>  Our children are especially at risk.  As they are not as developed as adults, they cannot avoid exposure.  The health risks for children are well documented.  A report that was published by the Institute of Public Health in Ireland in 2013, A Tobacco-Free Future, contained some interesting findings about children and smoking.  I read through the report yesterday and today in advance of my contribution to this debate.  I was interested to read that 22% of the primary care-givers of nine year old children reported that smoking occurs in the same room as their child.  It was also reported that 15% of people who had a family car allowed smoking in that car.  The report found that there is a higher prevalence of asthma among children who are exposed to second-hand smoking.  Indeed, it is also associated with severe asthma.<\/p><p>  Some people argue that smoking pollutants in cars have no effect, but research suggests otherwise.  The findings of research that was carried out in Canada to measure the effect that smoke pollutants have in vehicles are very startling.  It was found that just one cigarette smoked in a stationary car with its windows closed can produce a level of second-hand smoke that is 11 times higher than the level found in an average bar where smoking is permitted.  In the case of a moving car, the level of second-hand smoke produced by a single cigarette can be as high as seven times the average level of a smoky bar.  That is why the Minister is acting on this.  The evidence is there.<\/p><p>  Other countries have recognised that in-vehicle smoking needs to be tackled because of the risks it poses to children.  In February of this year, the Northern Territory was the last of the regions of Australia to introduce a ban on smoking in cars.  The cut-off points used in Australia, and the penalties that apply when the smoking ban is breached there, vary across the various jurisdictions.  In some regions, the smoking ban applies to minors under the age of 16.  In other regions, it applies to minors under the age of 18.  The penalties also differ.  An on-the-spot fine of A$250 applies in the Australian Capital Territory and court fines of up to A$5,000 can be issued.  In New South Wales, an on-the-spot fine of A$250 dollars is imposed on drivers, with a maximum of A$1,100 applying if this is disputed.  When the Minister is summing up at the end of this debate, he might indicate if he has details or views on the level of fines that may be imposed here.  In particular, I would like to know whether a fixed-charge fine will apply here.  If so, will it be similar to the fixed-charge fines that are charged under the Roads Acts?  The Minister might clarify that.<\/p><p>  We do not need to go to Australia to find examples of what is being done in this sector.  Across the Irish Sea, a ban on in-vehicle smoking has been introduced by the authorities in Wales, who were acting on research undertaken by Cardiff University suggesting that one in ten children in Wales were being exposed to smoke in family cars.  In England, a section of the Children and Families Act 2014, which was passed by the Parliament, empowers the Government there to bring in regulations to introduce smoke-free child-carrying cars.  In July, the British Government sought views on draft regulations.  It will be interesting to see whether this ban will be in place before next year's general election in the UK.  Other countries that are set to follow Ireland's example include Finland, the Netherlands and Taiwan.  It is unusual that the Netherlands is planning to introduce a ban, given that it has such a liberal regime.<\/p><p>  Under section 3 of the Bill, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have responsibility for the enforcement of the ban when an offence is committed.  The Bill also introduces a number of defences which are set out in section 5.  One of the main reasons given in England in opposition to the introduction of a ban of this type was that it would be unenforceable.  When the workplace smoking ban was introduced here, opponents made similar claims.  That is why I disagree with what the previous speaker, Deputy Finian McGrath, had to say.  It is all about compliance.  Since the smoke-free legislation was introduced here some years ago, the compliance level has been 97%.  A similar compliance level applies to the legislation governing the display of cigarettes in shops.  I disagree with Deputy McGrath's opinion on this aspect of the matter.<\/p><p>  Countries like Australia that have been to the forefront in the battle against tobacco have made similar findings.  When smoke-free dining was introduced in Australia, a compliance rate of 96% was reported after 18 months.  It is important to point out that smoking laws are generally self-enforcing.  Smokers refrain from smoking in smoke-free areas once they become aware of the laws.  That is why the Minister has introduced this legislation, on which I commend him.  It is important to get the message out there.  We must keep telling people how dangerous a threat smoking is to their health and that of their children.<\/p><p>  Various campaign advertisements are very effective.  One of the best anti-smoking campaigns in recent times was the HSE series of advertisements featuring Gerry Collins, who died at the age of 57.  We all remember how he said he would miss his kids, and miss not being there when they might need him.  Those were striking and heartbreaking words to hear from a man who was dying of cancer and was campaigning for others to kick the habit which had left him with lung cancer.  The HSE believes his adverts have helped 60,000 people to attempt to give up cigarettes this year.  His family and friends should be very proud of him.  We are proud of him as well.  Effective awareness campaigns have helped to change attitudes towards smoking.  It has now become very anti-social to smoke.  This shift in attitudes to smoking will ensure the latest smoking ban succeeds.  It will become very anti-social to smoke while children are in cars.  Those who persist with this activity will be frowned upon by the general public.  I do not doubt that over time, we will achieve the same level of compliance we achieved with the introduction of the various other bans.  I commend the Minister on bringing this good legislation, which will save people's lives, to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800050#XX00300","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1412785500,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and commend Senators Crown, van Turnhout and Daly on their work in the Seanad and, latterly, this House in introducing this legislation.  It is the duty of the Oireachtas to introduce and debate legislation that has a considerable benefit for certain sectors of our population.  This Bill undoubtedly falls into that category.<\/p><p>  The Bill's Title is self-explanatory, in that its main provision is to stop young people and children from having their health damaged by inhaling second-hand tobacco smoke in the confined area of cars.  It might also break the link between young people watching adults, in many instances their parents, and smoking.  It is a popular and well-received Bill.<\/p><p>  In a recent UK study, 1,100 people were asked whether they would support a ban on smoking in cars carrying young people.  Of these, 96% of non-smokers would support the ban.  Interestingly, 89% of the smokers surveyed would also support the ban.  They added that it might also help them to give up smoking.<\/p><p>  This is not a question of a nanny state introducing legislation, as &quot;nanny state&quot; automatically implies that people have a choice.  Children who are strapped into the back of a car and who must inhale second-hand tobacco smoke have no choice.  Something must intervene, namely, the State.<\/p><p>  It is no secret that tobacco companies target younger people to replace the customers and clients who either give up smoking or, as a result of smoking, pass away.  They spend a great deal of time and resources on trying to get young people onto the conveyor belt so as to maintain the industry.  I take this opportunity to ask the Minister to consider Florida's very effective truth campaign.  Its leaders had a fund of tens of millions of dollars, if not more, following a settlement with the tobacco companies.  They diverted much of that money into an effective marketing campaign, some of the results of which were interesting.  It should be noted.<\/p><p>  Reference has been made to the HSE's public health and information campaigns.  When targeting campaigns towards young people, a number of curious points have been missed.  The young are well educated and already know that smoking damages their health and kills, but they still take up the habit.  The study concluded that they did this so as to become individuals or to show bravado, leadership or standing among their peers and communities despite the fact or, counter-intuitively, because they knew it was dangerous.  It was like a counter-culture movement and people found smoking an easy and acceptable way of becoming noticed, involved, different or so on.<\/p><p>  The authorities in Florida adopted a different role.  They noticed that young people did not want to be told that they should not smoke because it killed.  It was a negative message and young people already knew it.  Instead, the authorities had to reinvent or replace a role model - the idea of smoking - with something else.  The truth campaign targeted young people and met them on a one-to-one basis by way of attending events, working through the media, spending a great deal of money on channels like MTV and being more nuanced overall so that young people would get the message that smoking needed to be replaced.  It was not just enough to say that tobacco was bad, would kill or would harm people's health.  It needed to be replaced with something else.<\/p><p>  I urge the Minister and his officials to consider this campaign.  We do not need to spend the level of money that Florida did.  It has already done the research and examined youth culture and the counter-culture pursued by certain elements of young people.  The conclusions might differ from those we might naturally reach.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  A modest investment using the excise and VAT moneys we accrue from the tobacco industry could be spent on a more nuanced or effective marketing campaign.  It would not be an information campaign, as young people already know the story.  Rather, it would be a campaign to replace something that young people feel is necessary.  The truth campaign aimed to make anti-smoking a brand in itself and was quite effective.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister consider a further aspect?  Since the Bill does not cover e-cigarettes, will he make provision to allow for a similar prohibition on the use of e-cigarettes?  We are not sure about the health issues involved, but e-cigarettes might cause difficulties for the enforcement of this legislation.  I support the prohibition of e-cigarettes where there are children in a car.<\/p><p>  I commend the Minister and Senators on their work and ask the former to consider what has been done elsewhere, particularly in Florida.  Such campaigns are well worth his consideration where they relate to young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800051#YY00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1412785500,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I join in congratulating and commending Senators van Turnhout, Crown and Daly on their efforts.  I also commend the Minister on laying this legislation before the House.  He is particularly passionate about this issue, his passion arising from his experience as a general practitioner, GP.  It is great that he is using this opportunity as a politician to address what he knows from general practice to be a major social and health issue.<\/p><p>  There has been a significant cultural shift in terms of smoking and - not to mix up the two - drink driving since my childhood.  Smoking is no longer cool in the way it was then.  The smoking ban has been a critical factor in that regard and I commend Deputy Martin, who piloted it.  The plain packaging legislation is also contributing to the cultural shift.<\/p><p>  Speaking in the Seanad, the Minister stated that we wanted to arrive at a situation in which people did not find smoking attractive.  By a raft of legislative initiatives, advertisements, etc., we are arriving at that.  Professor Luke Clancy's study on passive smoking in cars merits reference in the context of this legislation.  According to it, one in seven schoolchildren is exposed to smoking in cars.  Those who are exposed are more likely to start smoking, leading to respiratory and allergic symptoms.<\/p><p>  It is well known that cigarette smoke is highly carcinogenic, with second hand or environmental smoke equally so.  Every year in Ireland, 6,000 people die from tobacco-related diseases.  The inhalation of passive smoke exposes an individual to the same amount of smoke as a smoker.<\/p><p> If one is a smoker, one will lose ten to 15 years of one's average lifespan and 95% of lung cancer cases in Ireland are caused either by smoking or inhaling second-hand smoke.  These are very stark figures.  There are many who would maintain this legislation is a way in which the rights of adults and the choices they wish to make in life can be restricted and impinged upon.  This simply is not the case.  This legislation is about protecting those members of society who are too young to have a voice.  Noble person and fine individual that he is, Deputy Finian McGrath has stated that he, of course, would not smoke in front of children in a car.  This will remain the case for the great bulk of adults.  The great majority of adults would not contemplate so doing in the first place and, consequently, the issue does not arise.  Moreover, the legislation will even create a greater consciousness, whereby the ultimate number of offenders will be very low.  The purpose is to further create a consciousness in this regard.<\/p><p> As the Minister, Deputy Reilly, mentioned in the Seanad, there is no safe level of exposure to environmental or second-hand tobacco smoke and the danger levels are increased in enclosed spaces such as inside a car.  With this in mind, it is important to ensure that parents who smoke do not expose their children to this carcinogenic substance.  The 2013 policy document, Tobacco Free Ireland, makes the point that children are particularly vulnerable to the marketing practices of the tobacco industry and that the positive portrayal of smoking by models and in other forms of advertising glamorises smoking and makes it more attractive to children.  These issues all are being tackled in the plain packaging legislation.<\/p><p> Section 2 of the Bill sets out clearly that smoking in a car with a child present is strictly prohibited and that the person in question will be deemed guilty of an offence.  I welcome this part of the Bill, as evidence shows that such exposure is dangerous.  A study by the Canadian Medical Association stated there is some evidence to suggest that second-hand smoke inhaled in the confines of a car is 23 times more toxic than when inhaled anywhere else.  Similarly, MRBI research for ASH Ireland showed a popular acceptance of this point.  On the legislation, I acknowledge there are issues as to how one identifies age, how one identifies children and so on.  However, Members are aware that an individual garda will apply common sense in this regard.  One also realises that the very existence of the legislation will create a moral imperative not to smoke in front of children by which most normal adults will feel obliged to abide.  If one likes, they will not see it as an issue with which to play cops and robbers.<\/p><p> Sections 3 and 4 deal with the power bestowed on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the legislation.  It gives members of the force the power to issue a fixed-charge notice, which will be in line with the standard fixed-charge notice system in the Road Traffic Acts, and an extreme situation in the District Court can lead to a fine of &euro;1,000.  In the debate in the Seanad, Senator Crown made the point that the primary benefit will be educational and I concur that this will be the case.  People have come a long way in terms of their awareness.  First, popular awareness among the population regarding the dangers of smoking and its obvious harmful effects has become universal.  Second, there is an acceptance that something must be done about it and all the legislation is combining to alter the culture and to reinforce the need to tackle it.  This legislation does something similar.<\/p><p> I welcome the legislation and do not perceive it as being indicative of a nanny state.  A nanny state might be a state in which children were exposed to something about which they had neither freedom nor rights.  I will conclude on this point but sadly in recent years, Members have been dealing a lot in this House with situations in which the rights of children were infringed and let us not perpetuate that.  I welcome this legislation.  I am aware of its imperfections and of its implementation difficulties but the balance of good lies in its enactment and on that basis, I support it.  I again congratulate the Minister on having the non-partisanship and professionalism to accept the legislation rather than to go back into the ridiculous trenches from which Members tend to address legislative matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800051#YY00300","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412786100,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Catherine Byrne, who is sharing time with Deputy Mitchell O'Connor.

On Report Stage, this Bill was amended substantially by the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  The Department of Health worked in consultation with the Senators, the Office of the Attorney General, the Departments of Justice and Equality and Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in producing this legislation.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Reilly, on his Trojan work on this issue, about which he is passionate.  He is committed to addressing smoking and smoking-related disease and deaths in this country.  This Bill is another significant development in our public health policy, which aims to make Ireland a tobacco-free society by 2025.  This legislation is one of the many recommendations set out in the policy, Tobacco Free Ireland, which includes a range of legislative and other policy initiatives designed to reduce smoking and smoking-related illnesses.  Approximately 22% of the Irish population are currently smokers and the Government is committed to reducing this figures to 5% by 2025.  This Bill builds on the smoking ban, which was introduced in March 2004.  It was hugely successful and there has been a 7% reduction in the number of smokers since it was introduced.<\/p><p>  Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Ireland.  The number of premature deaths caused by tobacco use in Ireland is far greater than the combined death toll relating to car accidents, fires, heroin and cocain abuse, murders and suicide.  I was interested to hear Deputy Finian McGrath state earlier that there are greater health risks.  I do not know what they are when approximately 5,200 Irish people die each year from diseases caused by smoking and 44% of such deaths are from cancer.  Members should just imagine that one in two smokers will die from their addiction.  Smoking costs the health sector in excess of &euro;650 million per year.  What could be done with that money, were it available to be put back into the health services in the fields I have just mentioned?  These figures are frightening when one thinks how avoidable are these smoking-related deaths.  I am deeply concerned that Ireland's smokers start smoking at a young age.  They have the youngest starting age in Europe, as they start from between 14 and 16 years of age.  Members' goal, therefore, must be to prevent children and young people from starting to smoke.  They learn from us, their parents and adults to whom they look up and we must lead by example.<\/p><p>  Passive smoking can be just as damaging to one's health as smoking.  This is why I am so supportive of this Bill.  It is about protecting children and safeguarding their health.  This Bill will create a new offence of smoking in a vehicle in a public place in which a child is present.  Basically, it will be against the law to endanger children's health by smoking in cars.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be responsible for enforcement and can impose a fixed-charge notice or fine.  I agree this legislation will be &quot;self-policing&quot; in many cases and that members of the public will abide by this new law and indeed will encourage others to so do also.  Most parents are sensible and prioritise and protect their children's health.  However, there are some who continue to put their own addiction ahead of the health of their children and that is why this legislation is necessary.  An increasing number of countries, including Canada, Australia and, most recently, England, have either banned or are in the process of banning smoking in cars with children.  A clear message must be sent out on this issue.  Members are not trying to be heavy-handed but are merely trying to alert people to the very real dangers of smoking and passive smoking.<\/p><p> I also take this opportunity to welcome the standardised packaging of tobacco legislation, which was debated in this Chamber last week.  The passing of that Bill will see Ireland become the first country in the European Union to introduce legislation on plain packaging and the third country worldwide after Australia and New Zealand.  <\/p><p> I was pleased to hear the Minister, Deputy Reilly, welcome the announcement by the French Minister for Health last week that France plans to follow Ireland and introduce standardised packaging for cigarettes.  This is a positive move and we should be proud that we are leading other countries in protecting people, especially the young and the old, from the dangers of smoking through the introduction of standardised packaging.  Research by the Irish Heart Foundation and Irish Cancer Society has shown that the visibility of graphic warnings on plain packs would encourage teenage smokers to quit smoking.  <\/p><p> Sadly, when it comes to smoking, especially for young people, it is all about image.  According to the Irish Cancer Society, eight in ten smokers begin smoking before they turn 18 years of age.  The tobacco industry sees packaging as its key marketing tool, which is why it is very important to introduce plain packaging and put an end to the so-called glamourisation associated with smoking, especially for young people who believe it is cool to smoke.  Plain packaging has been shown to reduce the appeal of tobacco to young people and to increase negative feelings towards tobacco.<\/p><p> Together, both these items of legislation will go a long way towards helping Ireland to become a tobacco free society, and I commend this Bill to the House.  I say to parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles to put their children first and not their addiction.  That is the message that should go out from this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800052#ZZ00300","speaker":"1029","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412786700,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I am delighted that another step is being taken towards making Ireland a tobacco-free place.  It beggars belief that less than one generation ago many people went around smoking in the workplace, did not wear seatbelts and even drove under the influence of alcohol.  Thankfully, all of these practices have been addressed over the years.  Today, no one would even dare smoke in the office, not wear a seatbelt or drink and drive unless he or she was stupid.  That is because of two developments.  It has become morally unacceptable and it is a punishable offence.  This Bill will have the same positive lasting impact.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the strong disincentive to smoke in a car in the presence of children by making it a punishable offence with a fine of up &euro;1,000.  Unfortunately, the very fact that exposing children to second-hand tobacco will increase their chances of developing illnesses such as pneumonia, bronchitis, middle ear infections and even cancer is not enough of a reason for some people to stop smoking in a car.  The risk of being liable to pay a fine of up to &euro;1,000 will undoubtedly make those people think twice.  We have been protecting workers since the introduction of the workplace smoking ban in 2004 but not children, which seems bizarre.  I am therefore delighted that this Bill will finally correct that anomaly.  It will quickly make the idea of smoking in a car in the presence of a child simply wrong.  It will become socially and morally unacceptable.  We see it already with the smoking ban.  If anyone dared to smoke in an indoor public space, they would be immediately stared at, made feel uncomfortable and most likely asked to stop.  This is because it is no longer an accepted society norm.  When we go abroad to countries that do not have a smoking ban, the first complaint we have is how unenjoyable our evening was because of the unwelcome suffocating feeling of smoke in the restaurant or bar.  Anybody who sees an adult smoking in a car in the presence of a child will take immediate offence and make it very clear to the individuals concerned that a law is being broken and that a child is being harmed.  It is very important that this forms part of an overall approach to a tobacco free Ireland. <br\/><br\/>As Senator van Turnhout stated, we must demoralise smoking.  I am confident that in the long term this Bill will be very positive for the country just as the smoking ban was.  I am hopeful that prosecutions will eventually not even be necessary.  Children and parents will be aware of it and people will understand that this is something they should not do.  The society norm will be not to smoke in a car rather than <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Adults will become responsible and recognise that they are putting helpless young lives at risk.  Children cannot protect themselves from this risk and, therefore, we, the Government, must do so.  <br\/><br\/>I am not naive enough to believe that this legislation will not encounter stumbling blocks.  The tobacco industry has and continues to flex its muscles over the plain packaging Bill, on which I and other health committee members have worked.  The plain packaging Bill has faced strong opposition from not only within Ireland, but from the US, the UK and anywhere a tobacco giant industry is based.  The tobacco industry has rafts of lawyers poring over everything we do and say, looking to find weakness in law and a rationale for a challenge.  Let me say loud and clear to the tobacco industry that this country will not be bullied by it.  We, as elected representatives, have a duty of care to the Irish people.  We are not for turning on the plain packaging Bill. <br\/><br\/>This Government will protect the health of the Irish people.  We will take on the tobacco industry and fight it in the courts, if necessary.  The tobacco industry needs to back off.  The simple fact is that tobacco is the only product we know of that, when used as directed by the manufacturer, kills one in two of those who use it regularly.  <br\/><br\/>I fervently hope that this Bill moves through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad quickly and does not encounter delays as a result of the money-hungry, health-ignorant tobacco industry.  I commend my colleague, Senator John Crown, an eminent oncologist, who is here listening to the debate.  I also know that Senators van Turnhout and Daly and the Minister have put a great deal of work into fighting the tobacco industry and making sure that we protect our children and the Irish people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800053#AAA00200","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1412786700,"counter":641,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Bannon and he is sharing his time with Deputies Walsh and Fitzpatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800053#AAA00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1412786700,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Reilly, to the House.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the initiative of Senators Crown, Van Turnhout and Daly on having put forward this Bill.  I am also delighted that Senator Crown is here listening to this debate.  As a former member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the progression of this Bill is a clear testament to the significance and value the Seanad has to the legislative process post the referendum.<\/p><p>  Since the introduction of the workplace smoking ban in March 2004, there has been much greater awareness around the dangers of smoking and second-hand smoke.  Tobacco smoke is a mixture of gases and particles.  It contains more than 7,000 chemical compounds.  More than 250 of these chemicals are known to be harmful and at least 69 are known to cause cancer.  Children are particularly at risk from the effects of second-hand smoke.  Their bodies are still growing, they breathe at a faster rate than adults and they are also less able to avoid or reject it.  Breathing second-hand smoke can cause young children serious illness and will increase the chances of them experiencing health problems in the future.<\/p><p> Many Deputies have already outlined the various illnesses that can be caused from second-hand smoke and the likes of lung disease, pneumonia and deafness in children are the most destructive.  The greatest step smokers can take to improve their health is to stop smoking.  Almost 1 million people in Ireland smoke on a regular basis.  The Minister outlined that 5,200 people die from smoking each year.  That is 5,200 families, friends and communities who are affected by smoking.  I can only imagine the number of people affected by second-hand smoke.<\/p><p> It is known that one in every two smokers will die from a tobacco-related illnesses and it is also clear that anyone who smokes reduces his or her life expectancy by up to 15 years, even having stopped for some time.  While health professionals try to address patients' smoking habits on a daily basis, the individual must take the final decision to quit.  The more smokers who engage with health professionals, the more awareness about the dangers of second-hand smoke will add to their realising and understanding the dangers smoking poses to themselves and everyone around them.  I am delighted when people returning from hospital say the first question the surgeon or specialist asked was whether they smoked.  People have been told they owed their lives to the fact that they did not smoke.  There is a lesson in this for everybody.<\/p><p> I welcome the legislation, which will play its part in improving the health and well-being of the Irish population.  I have already outlined the threats children are under from the effects of second-hand smoke.  The Bill will protect children and work towards reducing the possibility of children suffering from serious diseases as a result of being exposed to second-hand smoke.  There is no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke.  Exposure to cigarette smoke is particularly dangerous in enclosed spaces, such as cars.  Adults have a duty and a responsibility for the welfare of children and this must extend to not exposing them to the dangers of second-hand smoke.<\/p><p> The Bill includes the legal principle of holding a driver liable for smoking occurring in his or her car in the presence of a child, regardless of whether he or she is the smoker.  It is very important that defences have been put in place in the Bill for the driver, for example, that the driver made all reasonable efforts to prevent the passenger from smoking.  However, I have doubts, for example, if two adults and a child are in a car, the adult passenger in the car is smoking and, as a result, the car is pulled over by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  How can the driver prove that he or she made all reasonable efforts to prevent the passenger from smoking?  I do not see how it can be proven and there is much ambiguity around the issue.  It could be the driver's word against that of the passenger.  I would like clarity on how the driver can prove he or she did everything possible to stop the passenger smoking.<\/p><p> While we talk about the dangers of second-hand smoke and work towards reducing it in legislation, we do nothing to lead by example here in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Visitors, staff and members are greeted each day by smokers standing outside the front doors of Leinster House and Leinster House 2000.  It is foolish of us to sit here and legislate for the people of Ireland on second-hand smoke when we cannot even control it right here on our doorstep.  The ashtrays should be removed from outside the doors of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If people want to smoke, they should get outside the gates of Leinster House to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800053#AAA00400","speaker":"1062","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412787300,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill.  This is the second time in two weeks I have been here to support the Minister, Deputy Reilly's legislation on discouraging people from smoking.  Last week, we discussed his legislation on plain packaging.  This Bill represents another milestone in the Government's tobacco control campaign, much of which has been led and inspired by the Minister.  His public health endeavours will form a formidable and lasting legacy.  As I said here last week, many in this House were economical in their praise of the Minister in his previous portfolio.  However, even his most ardent detractors must applaud the determined efforts that have brought us to this stage in the fight against tobacco.  Other protagonists also warrant praise for their contribution to progress in this area.  Senators Crown, van Turnhout and Daly are to be commended on initiating this legislation.  Senator Crown in particular has been iconic in his efforts to highlight and combat the dangers of smoking.  His advocacy, action and expertise in this area have been very important in stimulating and informing debate on the subject within and outside the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  Tobacco control legislation that comes before the Houses is often met with dissent from a tiny minority of Members who view such provisions as an attack on smokers' rights, and we saw an example of this earlier in this evening's debate.  Deputy Finian McGrath is usually left fuming in such scenarios and decries the persecution of smokers as if it were the prevailing civil rights issue of our generation.  However, I hope Deputy Finian McGrath will see through the smoke on this Bill because it seeks to protect children from health risks arising not from choices they make, but from choices others make.<\/p><p>  As many have already said this evening, second-hand smoke is toxic and carcinogenic and, in children, is recognised as a risk factor in a host of illnesses, predominantly respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia.  In the confines of a car, second-hand smoke is concentrated and inescapable.  It is right that people should be protected from having to spend time in such an environment and it defies reason that children should have to be ferried around in mobile smoke chambers.  The Bill is most welcome and is a natural continuation of the Government's efforts to denormalise smoking and protect people from the ill effects.<\/p><p>  I have no serious concerns regarding the legislation, only one observation.  Over the past year in particular there have been moves to impose a smoke free campus policy on many of our public hospitals.  While it is difficult to argue with such a decision in principle, there is a problem in that it is not being enforced.  I visited a hospital in Galway on several occasions during recent months and hospital doorways are still populated by patients who have nipped out for a quick cigarette.  The smoking ban on hospital grounds is not being enforced, and it is easy to see why.  For example, in the case of psychiatric patients, whose mental health must take priority over their physical condition, a sudden smoking ban could do more harm than good.  In the case of terminally ill or immobile patients, it seems punitive to send them on a pilgrimage to the front gate of a hospital to smoke.  Perhaps the allocation of outdoor smoking areas on the grounds of hospitals was an adequate provision.<\/p><p>  It is a complex issue and I do not pretend to have all the answers.  Although it was a good idea by the hospitals and the HSE, we should not make rules which we do not intend to enforce.  To do so to do so could undermine rules we introduce in other areas.  A lax approach to tobacco control in this instance could have implications for compliance with tobacco controls in other areas.  I do not envisage such problems in the case of this Bill.  I am pleased and reassured that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be tasked with enforcing the provisions of this law and that under the legislation they will be in a position to issue fixed-charge notices.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The Bill is a welcome step towards a smoke-free future.  I congratulate the Minister, and the Senators I mentioned, in promoting this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800054#BBB00200","speaker":"1185","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412787900,"counter":646,"content":"<p>The Protection of Children's Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Bill 2012 is to prohibit smoking in cars where children are present.  It will be enforced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  The Bill stems from a growing range of legislative and other policy initiatives designed to reduce smoking and smoking related illness over previous decades.  Some of the key legislative and policy initiatives to date have been the establishment in 1997 of the Quitline service to support smokers in giving up, the ban on tobacco sponsorship in 2000, the raising of the age limit to 18 years at which a person can be sold tobacco products, which was introduced in 2001, the introduction of the workplace smoking ban in 2004, the ban on the sale of cigarettes in packets of ten and the ban on confectionary which resembles tobacco products in 2007, the ban on the advertising and display of tobacco products in retail outlets in 2009, the introduction in 2009 of registration requirements for retailers wishing to sell tobacco products, the introduction of graphic warnings on cigarette packets in 2013, and the publication of Tobacco Free Ireland in October 2013.<\/p><p>  The aim of Tobacco Free Ireland is to reduce the harm caused by tobacco use, a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025, to undertake a social marketing campaign focusing on the risks to children from exposure to second-hand smoke, with particular reference to smoking in cars, and to develop and introduce legislation prohibiting smoking in cars where children are present, based on international evidence and good practice.<\/p><p>  Since the introduction of the workplace smoking ban in March 2004 and other tobacco control measures, there is a greater awareness of the risks of smoking and exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke.  It is recognised that smoking in cars exposes all the occupants to harmful second-hand smoke, SHS.  Second-hand smoke is a carcinogen and contains the same cancer-causing substances and toxic agents that are inhaled by the smoker.  There is no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke.<\/p><p>  Exposure to cigarette smoke is particularly dangerous in enclosed spaces, such as cars, and parents and others with responsibility for the welfare of children have a particular responsibility to ensure such exposure does not take place.  Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke is a recognised risk factor in the development of asthmatic symptoms In children, and increases the risk of other illnesses, such as pneumonia, bronchitis and middle ear infection.<\/p><p>  A child is defined in the Bill as any person under the age of 18.  It specifies that a person who smokes a tobacco product in a vehicle in which a child is present shall be guilty of an offence.  This also applies in situations where the smoker is under the age of 18 years and is in the presence of another child.  Where this offence is committed by someone who is not the driver, the driver shall also be guilty of an offence.<\/p><p>  The Bill also contains defence provisions.  A defence exists where the person smoking reasonably believed that the others present in the vehicle were over the age of 18.  There are also defences for the driver.  One defence is that the driver was unable to stop the other person from smoking because he or she did not wish to take any action which might compromise the safety of the passengers.<\/p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have powers under this Bill.  Where a member of the Garda believes that a person is smoking in a vehicle with a child present, he or she may ask the driver to stop the car and take the name and address of any person who may be committing an offence.  Where a person fails to stop the car or to give his or her name and address or provides false information, he or she shall be guilty of an offence.  A person who is guilty of an offence under the Bill shall be liable on summary conviction to a class D fine.  A class D fine is currently a fine not exceeding &euro;1,000.  That means the person will be prosecuted in the District Court.<\/p><p>  It is difficult to assess precisely how many children will be affected by the proposed measure, as this depends on the number of smokers who smoke in cars with children, and there are no precise data on this.  The total number of licensed vehicles on 31 December 2013 was 2,482,557, of which 1,910,165 were private cars.  While all these are potentially affected, clearly not all will be directly affected.<\/p><p>  Census 2011 recorded 1,148,687 children at or under the age of 17 years.  It also collected data on the commute to primary and secondary school.  A total of 296,711 students aged between five and 12 years travelled to school by car in April 2011, accounting for 61% of all students within that age category.  Primary school children who were driven to their place of education had an average journey time of 12 minutes in the towns and cities, and nine minutes in rural locations.  At second level, of 126,172 students, approximately 40% travelled as car passenger, and an additional 6,339 pupils, or 2%, drove to school.<\/p><p>  I commend the Minister, Deputy Reilly, on the Bill.  I also thank Senators Crown, van Turnhout and Daly for their contribution towards the Bill.  Just because I am a non-smoker does not mean I am anti-smoker.  People themselves realise the amount of damage that smoking can do.  I myself have experience of this as my father died at the age of 71 after being diagnosed with lung cancer.<\/p><p>  I commend the Bill to the House and I wish the Minister the best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800055#CCC00200","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1412787900,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence of Senator Crown, one of the three Senators who promoted this Bill in the Seanad.  I am pleased as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to see so many young people in the Gallery because this Bill very much relates to an area that affects them.<\/p><p>  This is about smoking in cars where children are present and it has received a lot of attention over the past year.  The Bill has contributed to a welcome focus on the area of smoking and the damage tobacco does.  If we wish to change our lifestyle behaviours successfully, mobilising public awareness on any issue is an important step.  To those who complain that this Bill is about the nanny state, I say let us be clear on one point: this Bill is not about restricting the rights of smokers but about protecting the health of children.  Children's exposure to second-hand smoke in cars is involuntary.  They have nowhere to go.  They may not be aware of the dangers of exposure to this smoke and they are not able to remove themselves from that risk if people smoke around them.<\/p><p>  There needs to be a greater awareness among adults of the risks of smoking and exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke.  As previous speakers have said, second-hand smoke is every bit as carcinogenic as what the smoker inhales.  It contains the same cancer-causing substances and toxic agents that are inhaled by the smoker.  There is no safe level of exposure to this smoke.  It is obvious that exposure to cigarette smoke is especially dangerous in enclosed spaces, such as cars.  Compared with adults, children breathe more rapidly and have a less developed immune system.  They are more susceptible to the effects of second-hand smoke.<\/p><p>  Parents and others with responsibility for the welfare of children have a particular obligation to ensure such exposure does not take place.  While I am in no doubt that all parents, relatives and carers want to protect the health of the children in their care, sometimes the onus is on us, the policy and law-makers, to remind them of their obligations in this regard.  We all have a duty to protect children from exposure to smoke.  The introduction of this legislation is a way of reminding those who care about the welfare of their children not to light up in a car when children are present.  It will also serve as a punitive measure for those who knowingly continue to disregard the welfare of children.<\/p><p>  A number of other countries have introduced similar legislation.  The countries tackling the problem of second-hand smoke in cars include Australia, Canada, some states in the USA, Cyprus and France.  The United Kingdom is in the process of introducing such legislation and no doubt many other countries will follow suit.<\/p><p>While numerous pieces of research have been carried out in other jurisdictions, only one relevant piece of research has been carried out in Ireland.  The TobaccoFree Research Institute Ireland has conducted research to estimate the prevalence of second-hand smoke exposure in cars in Ireland.  The research, which covered almost 3,000 children aged 13 to 14 years indicated that 14.9% of children were exposed to smoking in cars.<\/p><p> As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have a particular interest in the welfare of children and, as such, I am pleased to be in a position to bring the Bill through the legislative process in the D&aacute;il.  I again thank Senators Crown, van Turnhout and Daly, and all other parties involved in bringing the Bill to this point, including the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I thank the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in particular for its ready acceptance of its key role in the implementation of the legislation.<\/p><p> I wish to comment on some of the contributions.  Deputy Billy Kelleher spoke about the use of youth organisations to spread the message on the legislation and on other issues.  When we spoke about the plain packaging Bill last week I mentioned that I had visited youth organisations in Ballinasloe and Loughrea in particular that had won an award for a poster, which conveyed in a much better way than adults could to people their own age the message on the dangers of smoking.  We will certainly engage in such an approach.<\/p><p> Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan spoke about the extra work for the Garda.  The reality of the legislation is that it will in the main be self-policed.  In other words, when people are sitting in traffic and see an adult smoking in a car with a child present they will take action.  The opprobrium and peer pressure that will descend on people who will ignore the law will mean there will be very few convictions because people will not break the law.  I commend the Garda on its willingness to become involved.<\/p><p> Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan also suggested that the money raised in fines should go to the campaign.  However, the Exchequer tends to take all moneys raised from other fines and we then distribute them.  I fully acknowledge her point, echoed by other Members, on alcohol and drugs being equally problematic.  It was never the case of one or the other.  We must tackle all those problems.<\/p><p> Deputy Finian McGrath&rsquo;s contribution was interesting.  On the one hand he supports the Bill and the principle behind it, but on the other hand he attacks us for being a nanny state and he challenges us to leave smokers alone and stop bullying them.  He referred to the problems of illegal cigarettes and violent criminal groups.  I wish to make it clear, as I have done in every speech I have made on the subject: we are anti-smoking, not anti-smoker.  We will do our best to support smokers in every way we can.  My colleague, the Minister for Health has done that also and I have no doubt he will continue to do so.  The Department is very supportive of smokers and helping them to quit.<\/p><p> The most important point is that one should never start smoking because it is so hard to quit smoking.  I have seen patients in chest wards going out to the toilet with the oxygen cylinder on their back to have a cigarette, putting themselves and the whole ward at risk of an explosion.  That is how desperately addictive smoking is.  My own brother, who was a doctor and public health specialist, an epidemiologist, could not stop smoking and it killed him at the age of 60.  The trick is not to start.  We must protect children from ever starting and that is what the plain packaging law is about.  In this Bill, we are not picking on smokers; we want to support smokers, but we must protect children.  It is not a nanny state issue.  It is about the right of children to a safe environment.  There is no question of bullying the smoker.<\/p><p> The old chestnut of illegal cigarettes is again one of the industry&rsquo;s ploys.  We know that 90% of illegal cigarettes are contraband, that is, they are the cigarettes of the tobacco companies produced elsewhere and smuggled in illegally.  Less than 10% of illegal cigarettes are counterfeit cigarettes.<\/p><p> When we are drawing up the regulations we will examine the higher fines to which Deputy Breen referred that are in Australia and other jurisdictions.  I too wish to be associated with his comments about the very brave, late Gerry Collins, who made the advertisements, and to commend him and his family for showing such bravery and generosity and no doubt saving many other families from similar hardship in the future.  Deputy Harrington spoke about young people in Florida and the truth campaign.  We will have a look at that.<\/p><p> The debate on e-cigarettes is for another day because the evidence does not exist in the same way as it does for tobacco.  Deputies Catherine Byrne, Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor and Joe O&rsquo;Reilly all spoke in support of the Bill.  Deputy James Bannon spoke about cigarette smoking around the House.  That is a debate for another day as well.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick for his support also.  I thank all Deputies and parties on this side of the House and in the Opposition for their support on this important legislation.  I also thank the Senators for initiating the Bill in the Seanad and for their support on many other initiatives on smoking such as the plain packaging Bill and trying to protect children from starting to smoke.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800055#CCC00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412788500,"counter":649,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Protection of Children\u2019s Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Bill 2012: Referral to Select Committee","time":1412788500,"counter":650,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800056#DDD00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1412788500,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Sub-Committee on Children and Youth Affairs pursuant to Standing Order 82A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and (6)(<i>a<\/i>).<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800056#DDD00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412788500,"counter":652,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412788500,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 7.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1412789100,"counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800057#EEE00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412789100,"counter":655,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute;

To safeguard agriculture we must give greater support and protection to small farmers - not just large, intensive farmers - who may have to adapt to environmental pressures in the coming years.  Farming will have to change due to environmental targets and we will regret it if we allow more small farmers to disappear through the cracks.  Farmers need the support and protection of the Government to stay in business.<\/p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il's motion makes reference to suckler cows and I support this aspect in particular as it is an area deserving of Government support.  Suckler cow farmers are usually small farmers and it is not long since they received &euro;8 a head for calves.  The overall cap is now set at 50 calves - the farmer gets &euro;20 a head for the first 30 calves and &euro;10 a head for the remaining 20.  This is some distance from the support the Government previously gave.  The suckler cow scheme accounts for around one third of Irish beef calves and they provide the best quality beef in Ireland.  Around two thirds of Irish beef calves come from the dairy herd but the quality is not as high, which is all the more reason the suckler cow scheme needs Government support.<\/p><p>  The 2013 national farm survey published in May noted that the average family farm income in 2013 was almost unchanged from 2012 at &euro;25,600.  However, the average figure conceals dramatic differences between different types of farm.  The average dairy farm income increased by 31% while non-dairy farms saw a decline in average income in 2013.<\/p><p>  Irish farmers are being disenfranchised by processes that are occurring in secret - specifically, the EU-US transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, deal that is due to be signed in 2015.  It has been very difficult to discuss TTIP in this House and the media has taken little interest but it is a serious threat to Irish farmers.  TTIP will see huge quantities of US beef enter Europe, which will impact on Ireland's sale of beef to the rest of Europe.  Regulation in this area in the US is very inferior to regulation in Ireland and Europe.  In the US, growth promoting hormones may be used on cattle and we will not be able to produce beef as cheaply as the United States because we have tighter regulations.  If the TTIP deal is signed, huge pressure will be applied in Ireland and throughout Europe to lower the standard of regulation to allow competition with the US.  It is predicted that US food exports to the EU will increase by 120% by 2025 - this is double the projected increase in EU food exports to the US.  Ireland will be on the receiving end of this because there is very little of value to Irish agriculture in the TTIP.  Irish farmers should stand firm on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800057#EEE00400","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1412789100,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I wish to focus on the staffing crisis at Teagasc.  The public sector embargo on recruitment and promotion has had a huge impact on the ability of Teagasc to deliver education and advisory services at a time when demand is growing on a daily basis.  The number of people enrolling at agricultural colleges has rocketed and the need for innovation in the agri-sector is growing rapidly.  Teagasc has taken a huge hit on staffing and the overall number has fallen from 1,600 in 2009 to 1,000 this year.  This huge cut in staff has impacted on Teagasc's main areas of activity: education, advice and research.  Regarding education, the number of college students enrolling in these courses has soared by 144% - it reached 1,500 this year and that is three times the figure of a few years ago.  However, staffing levels have not kept pace and there is a shortage of teachers.  Teagasc has indicated it may have to cap the number of students in such courses.  It is difficult to increase class sizes in such circumstances and it might even be dangerous to do so because of health and safety issues relating to machinery and animals.  The colleges in Clonakilty and Pallaskenry have been particularly badly hit.<\/p><p>  The advisory service has been seriously affected and the number of staff there has fallen from 400 to 250 in the past four years.  It is simply not possible to give the type of service necessary.  Research has also been hit and six senior researcher posts have not been filled.

It contributes &euro;24 billion to the economy and is responsible for nearly 10% of Irish exports.  Agriculture provides 7.7% of employment in Ireland and this figure increases to 10% when marketing and processing are included.  In addition to its immense contribution to the national economy, agriculture has a broad regional spread and is the lifeblood of rural communities.  Rural Ireland is home to what is becoming our most important industry, one that offers great potential.<\/p><p>  Co-op marts are thriving and the live auction system allows a certain volume of stock to be sold and exported live, thereby providing farmers with a valuable force to counteract the dominant position of a small number of privately owned beef processing factories.  However, the dominant position mentioned is compounded by the application and interpretation of questionable movement and labelling restrictions on mart auction livestock.  These restrictions are implemented by processing factories and large UK retailers under the pretext of animal welfare and quality considerations but they have hampered live cattle exports from Ireland to the UK and stifled competition.  There has been a negative impact on the price of such cattle at livestock marts.<\/p><p>Will the Ministers of State convey a very strong message to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to urge him to do his utmost to address the ridiculous beef crisis and accelerate his endeavours to access new sustainable markets?

I wish to clarify that the Pillar 1 single farm payment in Ireland will be reduced by &euro;42 million over a six year period.<\/p><p>  It has been stated in the House that food and food production are fundamental necessities of living, which means primary producers must always exist.  As Deputy Stanley stated yesterday evening, one third of all farms in the country are not viable.  As such, something is wrong with our model.  To purely subsidise an industry without taking cognisance of the impact of this is not an effective way to give an adequate income to farmers.  Farming is a business and several key measures must be taken to make farming a viable and profitable business. These include putting it in the hands of young trained people, but there is no mention in the motion of land mobility or access to the land for young people who are properly trained and focused, with the best of knowledge and research available to them, and with the support of other sectors such as banking.<\/p><p>  Farmers should be given the power to negotiate and given a proper powerful position in the food chain.  People are now prepared to show goodwill towards organising and legalising producer groups.  We have seen how it can be done in a very effective way in Scotland with regard to shellfish production.<\/p><p>  The evidence suggests the difficulties with regard to prices are improving.  Four or five years ago, when the dairy milk price was at its lowest, co-ops were reducing the price.  In the main these are farmer owned, but it is hardly likely the prices were being reduced by a cartel of farmer-owned co-ops.  We should bear in mind there must be a balance in all of this.<\/p><p>  The beef industry in particular is being discussed.  This is probably the country's single biggest component of agricultural production and exports.  Traditionally it has not been the most profitable, unless one goes back many years.  There has been a difficulty because it has always seemed that for one player in the beef sector to do well it must be at the expense of another.  I am involved in the industry, and there has been no proper trust, dialogue or respect between the various stakeholders in the beef sector.  To this end everybody with a desire for a stable and secure beef production chain needs to engage positively with the forum.<\/p><p>  Presentations have been made to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine by various farming organisations and other representative groups.  It is noticeable that when organisations such as Macra na Feirme, the young farmers organisation, and the Irish Farm Managers Association, members of which are not generally landowners, come before the committee all they ask is for the gate to be opened so they can proceed.  They do not ask for a leg-up over the gate; they want a taxation code and structure to allow them farm whereby they make a profit and receive income from production at the farm gate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800058#FFF00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1412789700,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words on this important issue for Ireland.

We do not need a Private Members' motion to tell us; the facts speak for themselves.  We have secured &euro;10.7 billion in CAP funding and have added an additional &euro;1.9 billion ourselves.  I do not think we could make it any clearer how important agriculture has been and continues to be not just for the country but for the recovery of our economy, and not just for the beef sector but for all sectors.<\/p><p>  We are talking about the beef sector in this debate.  No one could deny that sector has had a tough few months and a difficult year.  Prices are down 10% on last year even though we had an all-time high in prices last year.  Farmers who bought store cattle at very high prices last year are losing money.  They are not even breaking even.  While we have a problem there, we cannot fix the prices.  Prices are determined by supply and demand, and by influence of production, length of production, life cycle, market conditions, consumer confidence and so on.  We know that confidence and demand for beef has dropped this year, not just in Ireland but everywhere.  We have a surplus of more than 40,000 animals.  We need to bring confidence back into the industry.  We need to invest in the industry and we need to invest in our young farmers.<\/p><p>  We all acknowledge that the horsemeat scandal has not done us any good, but we certainly have an excellent reputation in Ireland, especially when it comes to our traceability.

In view of the level of interest in the topic among all parties, perhaps the Whips might consider arranging a day-long debate on agriculture.  It is very difficult to make a meaningful contribution in three minutes.<\/p><p>  There is undoubtedly a problem in the beef sector.  Depending on whom one listens to, there are a myriad of reasons for it and a myriad of solutions.  It is important to remember we export 90% of what we produce.  There is a very significant contrast between the dairy industry and the beef industry.  The dairy industry is much more integrated.  There is a relationship between the primary producer and the processor.  That is not exclusively but primarily because of the co-operative structure which owns a considerable amount of the processing facilities.  With beef it seems to be a continual fractious relationship between the primary producer and the meat plants.  In the long term that is not a recipe for a successful enterprise.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Minister's beef forum initiative.  We need to move towards more contract-based production which would give certainty in the area of price.  There is a tipping point in the debate and we need to be very conscious of the consequences of going beyond that in terms of the continual criticism of retail outlets and processors in the beef sector.  That is not to say neither is beyond criticism.  We could have very useful contributions in a wider debate on how few players are involved in the processing sector in Ireland.  If we go too far, however, there is a significant danger we might alienate customers.  If some very significant purchasers of Irish beef, such as McDonald's and Tesco, are continually pilloried, there is a danger that they could strike back.<\/p><p>  There is another opportunity farmers could consider taking up but should consider history.  Kildare Chilling is rumoured to be for sale.  Perhaps it is time for farmers to consider whether they wish to enter the processing industry.  There is previous history in this regard when Cork Marts got involved in meat processing back in the 1970s.  It had plants in Grand Canal Street in Dublin, Leixlip and Midleton.

That is not an issue.  For example, the Minister played a blinder in the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations in securing &euro;8.5 billion under Pillar 1 and &euro;2.2 billion under the rural development programme, to which the Government is adding &euro;1.9 billion.  That success can be contrasted with where we started where farmers could have lost considerably more.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, changed the rules of engagement and how we would negotiate CAP.

Many steps have been taken to try to address the problem.  Farmers have invested a considerable amount of money in livestock and are out of pocket.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The problem might be less severe than it was, but it is still there.  Farmers continue to grapple with the challenge and are under financial pressure because of it.  These problems have not arisen because the Government did not invest in the beef sector.  On the contrary, we have had significant investment in the beef genomics scheme, technology transfer and so on.  The payment to beef farmers has doubled to &euro;80 per animal from the &euro;40 that was payable under the last Government.  We have had public consultations on legislating for the recognition of producer organisations and round table discussions on the future development of the beef industry.  In addition, the Minister has embarked on a series of trade missions in an effort to open up new markets to Irish farmers.<\/p><p> The main issue for Irish beef farmers at this time is the scarcity of beef in the North, with farmers there afraid to buy beef because they do not know how the United Kingdom market will be.  I hope the Minister will have a discussion with Tesco, Aldi and Lidl on the labelling issue.

The farming industry in this country is divided along a variety of lines, including east versus west, producer versus non-producer, and those who look after the land versus those who derive some higher incomes from the land.  This motion does nothing to address those realities.  While it calls on the Government to carry out certain measures, what is more interesting are the issues it omits to mention.  It has nothing to say, for example, about increased investment in the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, management of the new areas of natural constraint, increased investment for island fishermen, enhanced provision for agri-environment schemes and so on.  There has been a focus on historical issues such as the abolition of the farm retirement grant and the young farmers' installation aid scheme.<\/p><p>  Moreover, the motion contains no acknowledgement of the role the Minister has played in implementing a range of positive initiatives.  These include the moves to establish producer organisations whereby sectoral interests in the agricultural industry will be in a position, legitimately and realistically, to take on retailers and factories in achieving better prices.  This will be of particular benefit to the beef sector.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the former Minister, Phil Hogan, on his new role as European Commissioner-designate for Agriculture and Rural Development.  I am sure his appointment will be good for European agriculture while also bringing an Irish flavour to EU policy in this area.<\/p><p>  The abolition of the milk quota presents both huge opportunities and significant challenges for Irish dairy farmers.  That is not addressed in the motion.  We all recall how the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in government wrapped its arms around the construction industry.  This led almost to a wholesale closure of agricultural colleges throughout the country, including Darrara College in my constituency.  These days, by contrast, people cannot get into those colleges, such is the demand.  Farming is once again an industry to be proud of and one which will sustain the rural economy east and west.  We must have a more co-ordinated and nuanced approach to tackling the challenges that arise.  This motion, unfortunately, is not helpful and serves only to intensify divisions within the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800060#HHH00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1412790900,"counter":689,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Michael Creed, I note the lack of time available to Deputies to contribute to this debate.  I reiterate his point regarding the need for greater co-ordination among farmers and a greater effort to work together.  The public consultation process on the establishment of producer organisations is intended to increase farmer bargaining power and is key to the future of the sector.  For too long farmers have tended to be their own worst enemies in how they operate.  When there is a particular need to work collectively and perhaps hold back from the factories, that is the very time a couple of farmers will break, which undermines everybody else.<\/p><p>  The future of the Kildare Chilling Company in Kildare town is an issue that is very pertinent to me as a Deputy for Kildare South.  Serious consideration should be given by the farming organisations to buying that facility if, as is rumoured, it goes up for sale.  The factory has a capacity to slaughter 120,00 head of cattle and 500,000 lambs per year.  It is a very successful enterprise and, while not one of the big three, is a key player in the industry and a key employer in Kildare town.  It has state-of-the art boning halls and refrigeration facilities.  If the farming organisations really want a slice of the action, the opportunity for farmers to work collectively and the capacity to hold other factories to account, the possibility of taking over the Kildare town facility certainly is something to consider.<\/p><p>  The relationship between dairy farmers and processors, which is based on a more co-operative model, was compared with what happens in the beef sector, where farmers seem constantly to be involved in strife.  I am very uneasy, for instance, when I see farmers picketing McDonald's restaurants.  To the best of my knowledge, every beef product that company sells throughout Europe comes from Ireland.  The phrase about not biting the hand that feeds, if colleagues will pardon the pun, comes to mind.  There are certainly times when it is appropriate to hold processors and retailers to account, but we must be mindful of where the pressures are and avoid shooting ourselves in the foot.<\/p><p>  The motion refers to a fair standard of living for farmers, which is exactly what this Government is working towards.  A particular highlight has been the successful negotiation of the Common Agricultural Policy during the Irish Presidency, where Pillar 1 funding of &euro;8.5 billion was secured, together with rural development programme funding of &euro;2.2 billion plus an additional &euro;1.9 billion.  Some &euro;40 million has been allocated to the beef genomics scheme, allowing for a per head of cattle payment that is twice what was available to farmers under the previous Government.  Increasing that payment to &euro;200, as colleagues opposite are suggesting, would cost in the region of &euro;60 million to &euro;70 million.  I look forward to seeing Fianna F&aacute;il's pre-budget submission to discover exactly where the money will be taken from farmers to pay for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800060#HHH00300","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1412790900,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I will preface my contribution to the debate by explaining my role as Minister of State with responsibility for rural affairs.  While I am not directly responsible for issues arising inside the farm gate, I do have a supportive function.  Specifically, my role is to co-ordinate the work of the many agencies and Departments operating in this space.  I have a strong personal and ministerial interest in energising rural communities.  My focus is to develop systems and frameworks which will support the economic development of rural Ireland into the future and provide opportunities for rural dwellers to remain living and working in those areas if they so wish.  Rural communities have this Government's full commitment to doing all it can to support job creation and develop vibrant, dynamic rural economies and communities.<br\/><br\/>There are many challenges involved in progressing these objectives.  One of my main tasks is to achieve a heightened awareness of the challenges that exist and ensure all Departments and<br\/><br\/>support agencies are fully aware that rural communities have real potential but need support to achieve it.  I will seek to ensure agency plans are tailored to provide the necessary support and assistance and that they rural proof all their development plans.  I take this opportunity to congratulate my constituency colleague, the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, on his appointment to the European Commission.  We look forward to working closely with him.<br\/><br\/>A major element of my remit is to implement the report of the commission for the economic development of rural areas, CEDRA.  That report was jointly commissioned by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in September 2012 and launched by the Taoiseach on 14 April this year.  The independent commission, which comprised a wide-ranging group of individual and bodies, carried out a tremendous body of work last year.  The report contains 34 recommendations to support the medium-term economic development of rural areas for the period to 2025, including actions to be taken on enterprise development, tourism, broadband, artisan food and beverages, social enterprise, creative industry, capacity building and skills, regional roads, rural transport, water services, marine and renewable energy.  It was a very wide brief.<br\/><br\/>As part of its work the commission sought and considered the views of the public and stakeholders.  It hosted general public meetings, town hall meetings and meetings with key stakeholders, leaders of the business community and experts.<\/p><p>In total, more than 100 meetings were held and more than 1,000 contributions were made to the commission, resulting in a report that is grounded in solid foundation and, more importantly, reflects the strong beliefs, knowledge and experiences of committed and engaged rural communities.  One of the main findings is that generally rural areas and small towns did not benefit to the same extent as larger towns from the Celtic tiger boom.  Equally, there is very mixed evidence on the extent to which rural areas are experiencing any of the current uplift.  The report shows that rural areas have been particularly affected by the deep economic crisis and were adversely affected by high unemployment, resulting in a huge deficit in rural communities.  The impact is still visible nationwide with closed shops, the steady flow of emigrants and the resulting impact on the community and on cultural life.  <\/p><p> An important message from this report is that we should increase awareness of the importance of the rural economy in driving forward this country.  What this report was about was discovering the potential that exists in rural Ireland so that the dwellers in rural Ireland can participate in this economic recovery.  It was not about rural Ireland whinging about what it does not have but about rural Ireland being able to step up to the plate and participate in its recovery.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800060#HHH00400","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412791500,"counter":692,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak and I congratulate Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on this very comprehensive motion.  He outlined very well the volatile marketplace for farmers and the growing pressure on farmers' incomes.  We cannot allow farmers to be at the mercy of big processors and large supermarkets.  That is not a situation over which anyone could stand.  I would like the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, to set out the framework in which the market operates.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has called for an independent beef regulator to rebalance the power between the various parties in the market.  In recent weeks, we saw cattle prices rise in Northern Ireland and in the United Kingdom but prices in the Republic of Ireland have fallen to tenth place in terms of the highest to the lowest price in the European Union.<br\/><br\/>As a Deputy representing a rural constituency, I know that agriculture is the engine of the rural economy and it must be actively supported by the Government.  The previous Government introduced Food Harvest 2020, which is a very ambitious project.  It was the central plank of the policy of the last Government, as it is of the current Government, and it certainly should be supported.<br\/><br\/>Teagasc produced an annual income report for 2014 which shows great disparities in farm incomes.  Suckler cow farmers, in particular, have found it very difficult.  As they are heavily reliant on the single farm payment, which is gradually being reduced, we must look out for them, in particular.  The analysis by <i>The Farming Independent<\/i>last April showed that Irish beef producers experienced price declines up to six times greater than their European Union counterparts.  Some 80,000 dry stock farmers are seeing their work and effort sapped up by the large processors and the supermarkets.  <br\/><br\/>Last week the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>reported that a farmer in Ireland could expect &euro;350 less than a farmer in Britain for the same type of animal.  That comparison shows the seriousness of the situation.  I hope the Government will push the live export trade, which is very important in the west of Ireland and is an alternative to any monopoly by the factories.  The Minister is maintaining contact with the Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government.  That must be strongly promoted.  Finding new markets is also very important.<br\/><br\/>The Teagasc national farm survey from 2013 showed a 22% collapse in suckler incomes and a 39% reduction in sheep incomes.  I have had representations on the disadvantaged areas scheme payments in south Galway, in particular the Slieve Aughty area.  These payments were due in mid-September but no payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme were paid to farmers in the Slieve Aughty area.  The single farm payments are due in October and I am concerned about the situation for farmers claiming on commonages, such as the Roxborough commonage in Castledaly.  Farmers in that area claim they were issued with application forms in April 2014 with preprinted areas, which were wrong.  The farmers state that they are being accused of an over-claim, despite the fact they had been led to make the application by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I am concerned there will be a knock-on effect for farmers in other commonages throughout the country.  There is a commonage in Derrybrien, which has been cut from 99% to 50%.  Commonages like these are designated special protection areas and the onus is on farmers to comply with the EU directive.  As well as Roxborough, there are townlands like Cloughan, Kilbeg and Kilnacappagh where the digitised acreage in hectares was 1,115 - 100% - but it has been reduced to 476 hectares in 2014, or 42.7%.  Obviously, the people concerned have many grievances.  They are the people on the family farms - the cornerstone of the agriculture industry - and we must support them.  I hope we all recognise the right of all workers to get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work but I do not believe these farmers are getting fair play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800061#JJJ00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1412791500,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this motion, which is very timely and reflects Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's interest in developing, consolidating and stabilising  the position of the agriculture industry.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the new Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, and wish her well in her responsibility for rural affairs.  I do not wish to develop the point at this stage but I would like to raise with her the issue of the Leader companies and who will have responsibility for them.  Will it be a rural affairs or an environment responsibility?  Given the resources which, hopefully, will be available under Pillar 2, it will be important that the Minister of State's office and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will have direct control over and input into them.<\/p><p>  This debate affords us the opportunity to discuss and consider the serious and growing pressure on farm incomes.  The issue of the long-term sustainability of the agrifood sector is dependent on predictable and fair prices for produce.  I know the thrust of the discussion has been on the beef sector but there are other sectors in the agriculture industry which are under severe pressure.  I am thinking, for instance, of potato growers, about whom Deputy McEntee spoke.  Quite a number of large-scale potato growers in County Meath and in my own county of Louth are under severe pressure because of the very high cost involved in producing crops and because of the price situation.  <\/p><p>  There is a dangerous spiral in milk prices.  Nobody can say when the plateaux will be hit.  We are moving to the liquid milk production period of the winter months and the economics of that are doubtful.  Quite a few people are seriously considering moving to spring milk production and moving away from liquid milk production in the winter months.  That would not be good for the marketplace and for the overall position of the dairy sector.  It is an issue the Minister needs to urgently examine.  <\/p><p>  We also have the problem of cereal prices, which is not a north east problem.  The market for cereals is depressed.<\/p><p>The supply of cereals worldwide, however, is up on previous years.  It is a case of the old supply and demand consideration but it needs to be examined.  The cost of machinery and of running cereal farms is such that unless there is a fair and predictable return for produce, people will exit the industry.  The issue of introducing taxation measures to encourage greater land mobility will become irrelevant in that context because if the economics of production are not right, people will have to move on.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, the beef industry is being manipulated by processors and supermarkets.  As the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith introduced the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, which clearly set out achievable objectives.  I wish we could return to the main thrust of the development policy contained in that strategy to ensure that we can move on and create real national wealth in this country.<\/p><p> Price volatility is the bane of everybody's life whether one is engaged in milk, beef or cereal production.  Unless there is a decent margin of return for the primary producers they will find themselves in serious trouble.  With the capital requirement to grow crops on an annual basis and run farms, farmers must have a predictable cash flow from their products.<\/p><p> Reference was made earlier to spending money on the suckler herd.  There is no question that money spent on genomic upgrade and a temporary support for the sector to ensure that suckler producers remain in the industry is a no-brainer in terms of decision-making.  There is a clear, tangible and obvious benefit to the beef industry both in the short and the long term.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, will know, there has been significant investment in the genomic upgrade of the suckler herd in recent years.  That is a slow process.  It takes time to get the genetic upgrade into place but it has been significant.  The quality of animals coming out at the finished stage are excellent by any standards.<\/p><p> The big problem we have is the processes, the lack of margin, and the serious losses producers have suffered over the past six or nine months.  However, the one aspect of this debate that we cannot comprehend is the reason for the huge price differential between the price of cattle in the United Kingdom and the price of cattle in Ireland.  People say there are trade barriers.  Clearly, there are trade barriers but the problem is that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is standing on the sideline, and he is a helpless spectator in this context.<\/p><p> The Minister must get into the game and see what changes can be made and the hands-on initiatives he can take to redeem the situation as far as the industry is concerned.  If he does that there will be some successes and some failures but it will reassure primary producers that the Minister for Agriculture of the day is genuinely and seriously concerned about the economic well-being of the estimated 100,000 suckler farmers in the country.  Many of those are operating on a part-time basis because of the structure of farm ownership in Ireland.  Many of them are at the other end, particularly on the east coast.  They are full-time operators who buy the store cattle on the west coast and then bring them to the finishing farms and the feedlots on the east coast.  There is an integrated dependency in all of that.  We need good quality cattle coming from the west and the midlands into the east, and we need farmers with a financial capacity to buy such stock in the marketplace for a fair price, bring them home to their base of production, feed them and have them available at premium condition for hopefully a premium price.<\/p><p> The agriculture industry is important to the overall economy and has contributed to the economic recovery in the recent past.  Exports from the agrifood sector has been the cornerstone of that economic recovery.  It is important we realise that, plan for the future, examine the benefits of the supports Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v set out in his motion, and put them in place as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800061#JJJ00300","speaker":"945","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412792100,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion, which was brought forward because of the huge pressures facing the agriculture sector, in particular the devastating effect the most recent crisis is having on farmers' income.  The agrifood sector plays a pivotal role in the Irish economy, contributing a value of &euro;24 billion annually and providing over 7.4% of our national employment.  Agriculture provides 60% of employment within the agrifood sector, supporting over 300,000 jobs across the country.  It is the engine of rural Ireland and it must be supported actively by this Government.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, this Government has failed rural Ireland over the past number of years.  We have seen a reduction in funding for our rural roads and our group water and sewerage schemes.  We have seen the closure of rural Garda stations, the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio, which has led to the closure of small schools, and a lack of support for the post office network.<\/p><p>  This latest ongoing beef crisis is having a devastating effect on farm incomes, which in turn is having negative consequences for the rural economy.  The Irish farmer, the primary producer in the food chain, is being systemically undercut.  The family farm is simply not getting rewarded for the time and effort farmers are putting in, day in and day out.  They are not getting a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  This crisis has highlighted the vulnerabilities of farmers to the market volatility and to the manipulation by the stronger players, that is, the processors and the supermarket chains.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, the Minister has stood idly by as decent, hard-working men have seen their income decimated, and that is not just coming from the Opposition.  I refer to the recent publication from the Irish Farmers Association, which certainly would not be seen to be pro-Fianna F&aacute;il.  Henry Burns states: &quot;Minister Coveney has stood back for far too long and allowed the factories take full advantage of increased supplies to impose penal price and specification cuts which in turn have seriously hit farm families&quot;.<\/p><p>  Apart from what is happening being morally wrong, Article 39(b) of the Lisbon treaty states that the Union's explicit objective is to ensure that farmers get a fair standard of living from the land.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, should prioritise working with the new Agriculture Commissioner designate, Phil Hogan, at EU level and place a renewed emphasis on achieving a fair return for farmers' product.  He should clearly outline his plans with regard to live exports, which would offer an alternative to farmers, open up the market in which they could trade, and ensure greater competition.  The Minister must also immediately utilise existing legislation to analyse how the beef sector is functioning and establish the irregularities, if any, that exist.<\/p><p>  I complement the Minister on the agreement he reached with his Northern Ireland counterpart.  The agreement has been warmly welcomed by the sector and it is hoped it will increase North-South trade, but what monitoring of its implementation has the Minister put in place?  My understanding from talking to people within the sector is that one substantial retailer has expressed concern about the implementation of the agreement.<\/p><p>  The Minister should consider introducing a code of practice which would involve producers, processors and retailers.  That would ensure that the crisis of confidence and the lack of trust which currently exists would not happen again.  The current changes in specification, whether it be the age limit, the weight or residency, have been implemented without any prior notice to the producers.  That has been a significant contributing factor in the current crisis.  I believe if a code of practice had been in place, this would not have happened.<\/p><p>It is clear that the retailers have established a dominant position and there is growing evidence that the margin they enjoy has increased substantially year on year while the margins of the primary producers, the family farmers, have reduced.  The Minister needs to establish adequate pricing transparency in the retail sector.  There should be no abuse by the dominant retailers.  A guaranteed return should be given to the producers to ensure that the farmer gets a fair day&rsquo;s wage for a fair day&rsquo;s work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800062#KKK00200","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412792700,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate and I thank my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, for giving his time to debate this issue.  I listened with interest to some of the contributions from backbenchers on the other side of the House.  They sought to give us a history lesson on Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s performance in the Department of Agriculture and Food over the past decade and before.  It is a pity to stoop to that level in an important debate like this because it gives a lie to the recognition that there is a very significant crisis in the agriculture sector.  While it might appear like point-scoring, or answering the question, as one would in a college debate, it falls well short of what the farming community expects from all of us here.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s balanced motion with a solution attached deserves due recognition and considered debate from all sides.  I hope and expect that the Minister will engage constructively.<\/p><p>  I do not want to go back over agriculture issues but the previous Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, set a very ambitious target for the production output of the agricultural sector, Harvest 2020.  The target required successive governments to continue his efforts to ensure we reach that output.  It is not just a question of output because to have an output it is necessary to have a sector that can get a fair day&rsquo;s pay for a fair level of work.  That is not happening in the beef sector; it has not happened for some time and now it has reached crisis level.  I do not want to be over negative but the farming community does not believe the Minister is addressing this adequately, appropriately or in a manner that will help it to make an honest living.<\/p><p>  Farmers are taking &euro;3.60 per kilo for beef here while farmers for corresponding R grade beef steers in the UK will get &euro;4.60 a kilo.  On a standard carcass of 350 kilos, that amounts to a price differential of &euro;350.  By anyone&rsquo;s analysis, that is a phenomenal differential and is not acceptable when the retailers charge effectively the same price on the shelf for Irish and British beef.  Half of all our beef output is sold in the UK which it makes clear that this could have a detrimental impact on this sector, which this and the previous Government pinned so much on to improve employment prospects and generate increased growth in our fragile economy.  The view is that in recent months the gap has widened and the price taken by UK farmers has gone up approximately 30 cent, another &euro;100 per head.  That is not sustainable.<\/p><p>  There is no transparency.  We need a beef regulator to deal with this area.  Others have other ideas, and there is an expectation that the Minister could do more.  I have heard his comments and share some of his concerns about his inability to get directly involved in what is effectively an unregulated sector that is regulated by the markets.  There are other issues, such as the processing sector seeking to change the specifications at the same time as the supermarkets and McDonalds, a big user of beef, say they have not changed their specification.  They do not expect anything different.  The Minister and I know well that the attempt to change the specification is because the industry sees an oversupply of stock, resulting from the lack of export of Friesian bulls from the dairy herd in 2012.  That has depressed the market because of the oversupply.  I have not heard anything from the Minister or the Department about developing a strategy to deal with the increased production of the bull calves in 2015 when the dairy quotas end.  That has the potential to further damage the market in 2016 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800063#LLL00200","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1412792700,"counter":698,"content":"<p>We are doing a lot in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800063#LLL00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1412792700,"counter":699,"content":"<p>That is welcome and we need to hear that.  The farmers who are struggling, wondering if they should sell off their cows, which will have a further impact on our capacity to produce the levels of beef set out in 2020, need to hear it even more.  If the suckler cow is sold and farmers decide to move into some other enterprise or away from farming altogether, the crisis will be even worse.  The dairy sector has always taken the view that it would manage on a five year basis.  If there is a trough this year, it looks to the peak next year because it looks to the world market.  The beef farmer cannot do that.  I know a bit about this because the county I represent is probably one of the premier counties for the suckler herd.  I talk to farmers regularly who see no future in beef.  They see no strategy from this Government and therefore many feel that the only alternative is to dispose of the suckler cow and move on with their lives or discourage their sons or daughters from taking over the suckler herd.  That has real potential to be an interruption or shock to the targets projected in Harvest 2020.  It will require some intervention.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s proposal for &euro;200 per head for beef genomics is one measure that will help to improve the output of the beef produced and guarantee, in so far as possible, an appropriate level of return to the farmers.  The retention of the Friesian bull effectively for beef here in 2012 did not happen last year and therefore we will see some improvement but there is deep concern about what will happen in the future.<\/p><p>  The Minister has to tackle the factories and the supermarkets.  There is no transparency about how they report their profits or how they succeed in doing one thing in the UK and something completely different here.  The farmer here is taking all the pain.  There is effectively the same set of producers, almost the same set of supermarkets and at a certain point there is only 100 miles between our two islands, less to the north of England.  We largely produce the same quality - better quality, I would argue.<\/p><p>  There is a role for the Minister.  He has to force the factories to deal with this.  He also needs to consider competition between live exports and beef processing.  I know he has been making considerable efforts to improve the overseas market.  He has talked about the United States as a potential market but with the best will in the world only a couple of thousand tonnes will go to the US.  He was there recently and is going to China again, having been there last year, but not an ounce of beef has been sold to China yet.  I accept that the relationship with the Chinese market takes time to build and I wish him well with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800063#LLL00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1412792700,"counter":700,"content":"<p>A total of &euro;40 million worth of cattle hides have been sold to China.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800063#LLL00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1412792700,"counter":701,"content":"<p>The nearest market that needs to be dealt with is the live export trade to the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800063#LLL00600","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1412792700,"counter":702,"content":"<p>That is up nearly 20% this year.

There is a requirement for the Minister to involve himself more aggressively in targeting the processors and the supermarkets.  He should work towards finding an alternative market source; namely, the live export trade.  I am not suggesting it is necessarily easy to do that.  If the farmers saw the Minister working more constructively in that regard, rather than sitting on a jet and heading to China again with the industry, they might have more faith in him.

I agree that we need a full day's discussion on all the issues of importance to rural Ireland.  I refer not only to issues like beef and milk prices, but to every issue that affects rural Ireland and the rural economy.  We need to consider how we can create jobs and thereby help the people living in rural areas who want rural Ireland to continue.<\/p><p>  As we consider the motion under discussion, it is important to put many things in perspective.  We have spoken at length last night and tonight about the beef trade and who is responsible for it.  Some people have blamed the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for not going here and there.  The reality is that beef markets are in a difficult situation.  There is no doubting that beef farmers have gone through a few tough months.  However, we have to look at the facts.  We have heard about all the suckler farmers who are leaving suckling.  If one examines the figures that show how many people are involved in suckling, one will find that the actual drop has been just 1.5%.  That shows how few farmers are getting out of suckling.  I would like to make another relevant point in this context.

Prices have been cyclical all through our lives.  They will continue to be cyclical.  We are living in an open, free market.  I heard people saying the Minister needs to intervene by controlling the prices, but that is the last thing the farmers of Ireland want.  If prices were being regulated by a regulator, the prices for which I saw cattle being sold in Roscommon last week could not be achieved.  We are in a free market.  We sell into a market.<\/p><p>  The real problem we have relates to the fact that most of our beef is sold into the British market.  A year and a half ago, the British consumer said that Irish prices were too high.  That is what happened.  As a result, British consumers decided to buy their own beef.  That is why cattle prices in England are now higher than they are here, and British farmers are getting that much more.  That is the reality.  That is what is happening.<\/p><p>  We need to continue to sell into the markets and try to explore new markets.  Since he came into office, the Minister has been travelling the world to try to increase our market share all over the world.  Earlier this year, we met the Chinese people who came over here.  We showed them the product and the factories.  We took them down to County Wicklow to see the farms where these animals are produced.  They were impressed, but their vets have not come over yet.  We are working on that.  The Minister is going out in the next ten days to push that market.  There is huge potential internationally.  The American market is opening and we are working on that.

It is a timely motion because the last year has been very difficult for farming - I refer to beef farming, in particular - even though the weather has been more beneficial than it had been for many years.  We all know the value of agriculture in general to our economy.  It comprises &euro;24 billion of the national economy and accounts for more than 7% of national employment.  Teagasc recently indicated that the average income for a beef-producing farm decreased by 22%, to &euro;9,469, last year. A single person on the dole who receives &euro;188 per week was given more money last year than the average beef farmer made as an income.  That is the situation with regard to the income levels in farming.  It shows how difficult the beef sector is.  Against that backdrop, it is crucial for us to take any steps we can to ensure there is a sustainable future.  That means beef prices must be at a level at which farmers can produce.  The unfortunate reality is that for too many years in recent times, that has not been the case.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, said that prices are \"cyclical\", but the only cycle we have seen in recent years has been a downward one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800064#MMM01100","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1412793300,"counter":715,"content":"<p>No, that is not right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800064#MMM01200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1412793300,"counter":716,"content":"<p>With beef prices-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800064#MMM01300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1412793300,"counter":717,"content":"<p>The highest ever beef prices were achieved last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800064#MMM01400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1412793300,"counter":718,"content":"<p>The Minister and the Minister of State should let the Deputy speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800064#MMM01500","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1412793300,"counter":719,"content":"<p>The price that farmers have been getting for their produce has been decreasing as the cost of producing it has been increasing.

I am sure the Minister has looked at average incomes across the country.  For a number of the last few years, the average farm income in the BMW region has been approximately the same as the level of the single farm payment.  The position is slightly different on the east coast, where single farm payments account for approximately 60% of the net incomes of farmers.<\/p><p>For the BMW region, which is key in the production of suckler cattle, this means that for all the enterprise shown by farmers who work every hour that God sends them, they are not making money on the cattle.

Is it also true that the Commission is raising queries about the rural development plan and will have detailed observations that will delay the process further?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800066#OOO00300","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1412794500,"counter":738,"content":"<p>May I answer that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800066#OOO00400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1412794500,"counter":739,"content":"<p>No, because I am running out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800066#OOO00500","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1412794500,"counter":740,"content":"<p>The Deputy is asking me questions.

As I stated, I do not envisage the genomics proposal being a long-term solution.  However, as I pointed out last night, next year will be the year of the lowest direct payments to Irish farmers for many years.  If I may put it to the Minister in this way, in the case of a person who was bleeding to death, would one not give the patient a blood transfusion until he or she had stabilised?  In such a case, one does not think of one being obliged to do this all the time.  I believe we will be in a really difficult place next year.  It was the weather one year, in the year after it was the price and next year will be the year of the lowest direct payments to farmers.  There has been an accumulation of issues with regard to beef farming and, therefore, I hope that even at this late stage, in the interests of showing solidarity to farmers, all Members will agree the House should not divide on the motion tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Minister will accept the motion as tabled by us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800066#OOO00700","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"vote","time":1412794500,"counter":742,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 71; N\u00edl, 42.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Joe Carey and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl and Michael Moynihan.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800066#OOO00750","aye":["1062","980","1079","989","1029","1042","975","1092","988","972","1041","1093","1087","1006","991","986","994","1091","968","1075","1007","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1068","1055","951","1051","995","1106","1089","949","973","1033","1012","1021","1110","1053","990","1023","1180","1194","1000","977","1038","1026","1004","1070","1034","1067","1045","955","1060","1058","1073","971","1081","964","966","1074","1013","1048","961","978","1010","1095","1185","1024"],"nay":["1190","1193","1057","1083","1101","1037","1192","959","1107","976","1022","1047","1050","1108","1094","960","1049","983","945","998","999","1008","1017","993","965","981","987","1052","969","1044","1054","1028","984","1059","1005","1001","953","970","1102","1080","1065","956"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412794500,"counter":743,"content":"<p>Motion, as amended, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1412794500,"counter":744,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800066#OOO00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1412794500,"counter":745,"content":"<p>The Select Sub-Committee on Finance has concluded its consideration of the European Stability Mechanism (Amendment) Bill 2014 and has made no amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800066#OOO01000","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412794500,"counter":746,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 October 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
