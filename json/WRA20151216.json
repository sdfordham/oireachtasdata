Short-term jobseekers have never been eligible for the bonus, and this arrangement continues to apply this year.  <\/p>  <p>  In the case of most eligible schemes, all recipients of the payment receive the bonus and there is no duration requirement e.g. the State Pension, Widow's Pension, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer's Allowance, etc.<\/p>  <p>  Recipients of Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) must have in receipt of the payment for a minimum of 15 months (390 days) in order to be eligible for the bonus.  Long-term jobseekers are eligible for the bonus in recognition of their being wholly or mostly financially dependent on their welfare payment for income.<\/p>  <p>  Participants on JobBridge, who were in receipt of JA immediately prior to participation on the scheme, must have been in receipt of JA for 15 months prior to starting on JobBridge, or have 15 months duration in total combined on JA and JobBridge, in order to be eligible for the bonus.  This arrangement also applies for participants on Back to Education Allowance.  It should be noted that participants on these schemes who were previously in receipt of other eligible payments, such as Disability Allowance or One-Parent Family Payment, are automatically eligible for the bonus.  The 15 months duration requirement applies only to those participants who were previously in receipt of JA immediately before starting on the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Two other payments also have the 15 months duration requirement &ndash; Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Direct Provision Allowance.  The Christmas bonus (when paid in the past) was administered for SWA recipients by the Community Welfare Service (CWS) of the HSE.  The CWS transferred into this Department in late 2011. Prior to the abolition of the Bonus in 2009, there was variation in the administration of the bonus across HSE areas.  When the bonus was re-introduced last year, entitlement was standardised for SWA recipients in line with Jobseeker's Allowance.  It should be noted that persons on Basic SWA (with a duration of less than 15 months) who are awaiting a decision on a long term scheme (to which the Bonus applies) will receive the Bonus if entitlement to the relevant scheme is backdated to cover the week in which the Bonus would have been payable for 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The calculation of the 390 days is contingent on how claims are linked.  If there is a break of up to 52 weeks in a person's JA claim &ndash; for instance, if a person in receipt of JA found employment that lasted for 10 months, or went on an Education and Training Board course, and subsequently claimed JA again &ndash; the time spent on JA immediately prior to the job\/course would be combined with the time on the current claim in order to assess eligibility for the bonus.  In this regard, a JA recipient's current claim may be less than 390 days and he or she can still qualify for the bonus, if the claim can be linked to a previous eligible claim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600076#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Internship Scheme Data","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600076#WRB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[45525\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600076#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons participating in JobBridge schemes, by county, in each of the years 2011 to date, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>JobBridge was introduced in July 2011 in response to the unprecedented collapse in the economy- particularly the sharp increase in unemployment.

These families are eligible for social welfare payments on the same basis as Irish citizens and are entitled to apply for relevant social welfare weekly payments such as basic supplementary welfare allowance, jobseekers allowance, one parent family payment and child benefit appropriate to the circumstances of the individual or family.<\/p><p>  The types of social welfare payments or rates of payments paid to these individuals is a matter between the individuals themselves and the Department.  In general, refugees while resident in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC) receive accommodation, food and other basic services provided by the State.  Social Welfare legislation allows for the assessment of the non-cash benefits provided to the residents and the Department assesses the value of these non-cash benefits when determining appropriate rates of social welfare payments.  This generally results in a reduction of the weekly amount payable taking into account that basic requirements such as food, accommodation and other services are provided.  Refugee families are also entitled to receive child benefit and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance depending on their family circumstances.<\/p><p>  The Department can make exceptional needs payments (ENPs) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure such as seeking accommodation, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Programme Refugees and others with refugee status can apply for ENPs to meet needs as they arise, for example for essential items such as clothing or other personal items, travel costs and also rent deposits to support the transition into rented accommodation.<\/p><p>  Once the period of orientation in the reception centre is over and the families move to accommodation in the community, the means assessment is reviewed and entitlement to the relevant social welfare payment is recalculated to reflect the changed situation.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. <\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for SPC also being satisfied. <\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>  <p>  The most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  It further confirms that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund due to the distributive nature of the Fund. <\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the 'yearly average' system with a 'total contributions approach'.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  The position of women who were homemakers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600077#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600077#WRC01000"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[45592\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600077#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of the case of a person (details supplied) in County Louth who applied for carer's allowance on behalf of a spouse in August 2015 but has not yet received a response; when a decision will be made; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":142,"content":"<p>Carer's Allowance (CA) is a social assistance payment made to persons who are providing full-time care and attention to a person who has a disability such that they require that level of care and who satisfy a means test.<\/p><p>I can confirm that an application for CA was received on 18 August 2015.

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been\u00a0focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  Officials from my Department regularly meet representatives from the SFA,\u00a0ISME and Chambers Ireland, whose membership encompasses the hotel sector,\u00a0to discuss issues around access to finance.<\/p><p>The Central Statistics Office release &quot;Overseas Travel August - October 2015&quot; () shows that in the period January to October 2015, there were over 7.4 million visits to Ireland.\u00a0 Overall trips to Ireland were up 12.8% in the first ten months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\u00a0 For the three-month period from August-October 2015, overseas trips to Ireland increased by 14%.<\/p><p>Tourism delivers income and jobs in every town and city in the country.  The reduction in VAT to 9%\u00a0in the tourism sector and the abolition of the air travel tax improved Ireland's competitiveness. \u00a0The 9% VAT rate is a major benefit to the tourism sector and is much sought after by other sectors in the economy.\u00a0 I announced changes to the Employment and Investment Incentive scheme last year subject to compliance with European State Aid provisions.  With specific regard to the hospitality sector, I extended the inclusion of hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation in the scheme by a further 3 years.\u00a0\u00a0The benefit of these policies can be seen in tourist numbers, new businesses, the survival of established businesses and, most of all, in employment.<\/p><p>Turning to the banking sector, AIB and Bank of Ireland are concentrating on growing their balance sheets.\u00a0\u00a0In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for\u00a0small and medium sized\u00a0businesses.  The SME State Bodies Group\u00a0provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance, and includes representation from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.\u00a0<\/p><p>Some of the main\u00a0policies introduced by this Government to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:  <\/p><p>- The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014.  On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.\u00a0 The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at\u00a0<\/p><p>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth.\u00a0 The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is an initiative designed to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms then have recently been available on the Irish Market in recent times.  The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs. It uses a network of lending partners known as 'on lenders' to make its funds available to SMEs.  Bank of Ireland, AIB, Finance Ireland and Merrion Fleet Management are all current on lending partners of the SBCI.\u00a0 The SBCI has reached a significant milestone as &euro;110 million has now been drawn down by 3,200 SMEs.  More information on the SBCI can be found on\u00a0.<\/p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has recently brought legislation to the Oireachtas which will enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included. <\/p><p>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.\u00a0 Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices\u00a0nationally to administer this fund <\/p><p>- The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.\u00a0They also examine\u00a0cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.\u00a0 This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.

The Schemes involved include the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme.\u00a0 Under EU Regulations, all applications must be subjected to robust administrative checks prior to payment. The main element of the administrative check is an area assessment. This is achieved by using the detailed database of individual land parcels.\u00a0This is known as the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) which currently records, electronically, some 1 million individual land parcels and which is required to be kept fully updated.<\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s systems in this critical area must meet demanding EU and national audit requirements. Only valid applications under the BPS and ANC that fully comply with the requirements of the EU legislation are paid.\u00a0 Consequently, all applications under the Schemes are subject to administrative checks. Cases that do not pass the validation process go into error and cannot be paid pending a resolution of the error concerned.\u00a0 These errors include over-claims, dual claims and incomplete application forms.\u00a0 In addition, applicants under the ANC scheme must fulfil stocking density and retention requirements. My Department enters into correspondence, mainly through the issuing of query letters to farmers, in order to resolve these error cases. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has received approximately 123,000 applications under the BPS from applicants who currently hold entitlements and 102,000 applications from those eligible under the ANC scheme. In relation to the BPS and Greening Payment, I am pleased to confirm that advance payments began issuing in Ireland on 16 October 2015.\u00a0\u00a0 This is the earliest that payments can commence under the governing EU Regulations.\u00a0 In addition, I can confirm that the level of the advance payment was set at 70% for 2015 rather than the normal 50%.\u00a0 The increase in the advance payment for 2015 is, in particular, due to the difficulties encountered in the dairying and pigmeat sectors. The balancing payments commenced issuing as scheduled on 1 December.   <\/p>  <p>  Despite the extension of the closing date for the receipt of applications by two weeks, with a consequent reduction of the processing time available, Ireland was among the earliest to pay the BPS\/Greening in the European Union. To date, in excess of 119,000 farmers have received payments totalling &euro;1.054 billion - this represents 97% of the applicants. There is no rationale for partial payments, using scarce IT and processing resources, when the Department is targeting a payment figure of 99% by Christmas. In relation to the ANC Scheme, I can confirm that payments commenced, on schedule, on 23 September. To date, in excess of 89,600 farmers have received payments totalling &euro;191 million.

The funding for any such FIs would have to draw on Ireland&rsquo;s existing RDP allocation of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development funding as well as National Exchequer funding.<\/p>  <p>  So far 7 Programmes from 5 Member States have implemented a FI for the current programme period. In order to include a FI as a measure in a RDP an Ex ante assessment is required by EU regulation. This assessment can take between 3 months to a year to complete.<\/p>  <p>  Once this is done, an agreement must be reached between my Department and any other potential stakeholders\/financial institutions on a clear investment strategy that is developed from the gaps, if any, identified in the ex ante assessment. Following this, a new measure description would have to be drafted and inserted into the RDP by way of an amendment. FIs can only be introduced to the RDP this way and currently only one amendment is allowed per year; this could mean that the FI assessment would not be completed in time for Ireland&rsquo;s next amendment in 2016. The European Commission have, however, proposed a change to the Regulation in order to allow Member States to lodge a separate amendment to the RDP in respect of Financial Instruments and this will be decided on in the near future. While this would allow greater flexibility in terms of inserting an FI measure into the RDP, the timeframe from assessment to Commission approval means that the whole process could still take a year or more.<\/p>  <p>  In the interim my Department has been exploring new and more competitive sources of funding for Irish Agriculture and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements. For example, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which includes the European Investment Bank as one of its funding partners, launched a new &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo; product earlier this year. This credit is available at favourable terms for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products. The features of these products compared with those currently on the market are lower interest rates, loan amounts up to &euro;5 million and increased repayment flexibility.

The HRB is a statutory body under the aegis of the Department of Health and is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research.  The HRB has a current annual budget  in the region of &euro;40m.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the valuable work of the MRCG and the Deputy may be aware that since 2006, the work of the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCG) has been supported by my Department through annual funding to the Health Research Board (HRB) for the co-funding of research projects with medical research charities.  The level of funding is currently at &euro;900,000 per annum.  This innovative joint funding scheme allows members of the MRCG to support clearly defined research projects in disease areas and patient populations of specific interest to each individual charity, where they might otherwise not be in a position to finance the full cost of that research.  Officials in my Department recently met with representatives of the MRCG and discussed ways in which the Department can support the organisation during 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Developments in the health sector structures such as the appointment of a Chief Academic Officer to the management teams of the Hospital Groups will put research on the agenda of the healthcare system at a high level.  That, combined with a commitment by my Department to drive a research, evidence and data analytics agenda are important enablers for driving the research agenda.  Indeed, a new Assistant Secretary for Research and Development and Health Analytics, was recently appointed in my Department.  This appointment is further evidence of how I view the crucial importance of health research and data to providing the foundations for sound health policies, practices and outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to embedding research and evidence at the heart of health policy and practice.  My Department is working with the HSE to ensure that this agenda is driven and supported in a co-ordinated way at corporate level by the Executive.  As part of this process options will be explored on how best this can be achieved.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the other areas raised I can inform the Deputy that a revised General Scheme of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by Government in November and the Bill is expected  to be published in 2016.  It is  also envisaged that the Heads of the Human Tissue Bill will be progressed in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The National Rare Disease Plan recommended that an Oversight Implementation Group of relevant stakeholders led by the HSE and including patients' groups, be established to oversee and monitor implementation of the plan's recommendations.  This group was established by my Department earlier this year and it has met on a number of occasions.  One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.  This programme will be responsible for, among others: Mapping, developing and implementing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise - nationally and internationally; developing treatment guidelines for many rare disorders; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600087#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600087#WRO01100"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[45502\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600087#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 17 who requires a long-term care plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

Ultimately, the decision to release him will be made solely by the Egyptian authorities. Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release. <\/p>  <p>  All actions taken in this case are considered in light of the Government&rsquo;s clear objectives.  First, to see our citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland, and second to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.  The considered approach and sustained action that has been taken by my Department to date in this case has been to further these objectives, and most importantly to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to his best interests. <\/p>  <p>  I have engaged closely with the European Union&rsquo;s High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the Commission, Ms. Federica Mogherini, in regard to this citizen&rsquo;s detention and our actions are both carefully considered and closely coordinated.  The Government&rsquo;s Embassy in Cairo is also in frequent contact with the European External Action Service and other European delegations in Egypt. <\/p>  <p>  My Department retains the flexibility to adapt its approach as and when that may be required, and I will continue to cooperate closely with the relevant stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  The matter raised in regard to visits was dealt with privately between my Department and this citizen&rsquo;s family at a meeting last week.  It would not be appropriate to publicly address matters relating to the consular assistance provided to a citizen in public. <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the citizen&rsquo;s trial has indeed begun, with ten adjournments so far.  While the stage of substantive hearings has not yet commenced, the case is considered to be in process, as would also be the case in the Irish judicial system.  I have expressed my deep dissatisfaction at the lengthy adjournments to both Foreign Minister Shoukry and Ambassador Gendi, and will continue to intervene on this citizen&rsquo;s behalf at the appropriate times and in the appropriate ways. <\/p>  <p>  As both I and the Taoiseach have reported previously to the House, an application for this citizen&rsquo;s release under the Presidential Decree\/Law 140 was made in February of this year by the citizen&rsquo;s Egyptian lawyer.  That application was formally supported by the Irish Government by way of diplomatic note and has been followed up on in subsequent meetings with Egyptian officials.

We work closely with local and international non-governmental organisations to strengthen their capacity to respond to gender-based violence and to support the development and implementation of laws which prevent such violence from occurring.  Our work in this area was recognised by the OECD last year which praised Ireland for the &ldquo;effective agenda setting role it plays on gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment&rdquo; including being &ldquo;a powerful force behind the stronger donor focus on tackling violence against women&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  Through its funding to Irish non-governmental organisations, Irish Aid supports a range of programmes focused on the elimination of gender-based violence.  The Department also collaborates very closely with Irish non-governmental organisations through its membership Irish Consortium on Gender-based Violence, a unique grouping of Irish development and humanitarian organizations and the Irish Defence Forces.  The Consortium works to build its members&rsquo; capacity to respond to all forms of gender-based violence in conflict, post-conflict and long-term development contexts and to advocate for the elimination of gender based violence, globally. <\/p>  <p>  This year, Irish Aid has renewed its partnership with the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women.  The Trust Fund is a unique multi-lateral grant-making mechanism exclusively devoted to supporting the work of local non-governmental organisations in developing organisations focused on addressing violence against women and girls.  Since its establishment in 2006, the Trust Fund has awarded $103 million to projects in 136 countries.  I expect that Irish Aid&rsquo;s support to the Trust Fund will continue next year. <\/p>  <p>  As women and girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual and gender-based violence in emergency situations, Irish Aid prioritises their protection in its humanitarian action.  Earlier this year, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade launched Ireland&rsquo;s second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security (2015-2018).  In addition to identifying concrete commitments which will ensure the protection of women and girls in conflict, the new Plan also places an increased focus on the importance of women&rsquo;s empowerment and participation in decision-making in conflict and post-conflict situations.<\/p>  <p>  At the European level, Ireland has been actively engaged in ensuring commitments by the Foreign Affairs Council to combat gender-based violence, including two sets of Council Conclusions focused on gender and development, in May and October of this year.  In October, the Council launched the EU&rsquo;s second Gender Action Plan (2016-2020), placing an emphasis on the importance of preventing and responding to such violence in emergencies, including in EU and Member State development programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600091#WRS00550","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Issues","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[45605\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the outcome of the most recent discussions he has had with the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr Philip Hammond, and with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, in relation to the forthcoming referendum on British membership of the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":382,"content":"<p>In discussions with all British ministers, I always stress the particular value we attach to the UK&rsquo;s membership of the European Union.  That was the case when I last met Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond in London on 23 November.  I explained to him why the UK&rsquo;s place in the EU matters as much as it does to us and outlined our determination to be as helpful as we can be in the negotiations that lay ahead.  This meeting was the third formal meeting between us in the last 12 months, with the previous two meetings having taken place in Dublin.  We also meet more informally at meetings of EU Foreign Ministers and in other fora.<\/p>  <p>  The British Government understands our approach to their relationship with the European Union.  The subject regularly arises not just in my discussions with my UK counterpart but also in exchanges between the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron and between our Minister of State for European Affairs and his British counterpart.  Both the Taoiseach and I have also spoken publically in Britain about the potential negative implications for Ireland of a UK withdrawal from the Union to influential audiences such as the British Irish Association, the Confederation of British Industry and Chatham House.<\/p>  <p>  We are working hard as well to ensure that the Northern Ireland dimension to this debate is taken fully into account by the UK government.  That is because the Government believes that the EU has been a real force for good for everyone in the North, whether in terms of supporting the peace process or by helping to create jobs and growth.  I have made this point in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, with whom I have worked closely since the summer of 2014.  Earlier this month I also spoke at a conference at Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast along with the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and Personnel, Arlene Foster.  At that conference, I outlined why the uncertainty of a UK withdrawal from the EU would be bad not just for the North but for Ireland as a whole. <\/p>  <p>  The immediate challenge &ndash; including at tomorrow&rsquo;s European Council &ndash; is to work with both the UK and our other 26 EU partners to reach an agreement that both addresses UK concerns and is acceptable to every EU Member State.  While a deal is unlikely to be reached this week, we hope that the foundations can be put in place so that a solution can be achieved in early 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The question of the UK&rsquo;s future within the European Union will, however, ultimately be decided by the British people.  While Ireland has much at stake &ndash; and the Government will continue to make its voice heard in the debate &ndash; we need to remain respectful of the democratic process underway in our neighbouring country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":383,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":384,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[45608\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the efforts he and his European Union counterparts have made in relation to the plight of refugees fleeing the Middle East and North Africa, the progress on developing an adequate and comprehensive European Union response programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":385,"content":"<p>The scale of the migration challenge facing the international community is enormous.  The conflict in Syria - the biggest driver behind this year&rsquo;s migrant flows - has led to the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis.  But the problem is bigger than Syria.  An estimated 60 million displaced people worldwide are on the move, the highest since World War II.  They are coming not just from Syria but from such places such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza and a dozen or so countries in sub-Saharan and North Africa.<\/p>  <p>  For most of this year Migration has been at the very top of the EU agenda.  There have been no fewer than five special meetings of Justice and Home Affairs ministers devoted to migration while Heads of State and Government have debated the issue in three special councils.  I and my foreign minister colleagues have also addressed the issue many times this year.<\/p>  <p>  In June, the Foreign Affairs Council launched EUNAVFOR Med, the EU&rsquo;s naval operation to disrupt the dangerous activities of people smugglers in the Mediterranean, which have tragically resulted in the loss of many lives. As the Deputy will know, the crews of the L.E. Niamh, Eithne and Samuel Beckett have done sterling work in saving more than 8,500 lives. <\/p>  <p>  In September, the Government decided accept up to 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees as part of the European Commission&rsquo;s comprehensive plan to address the migration crisis. <\/p>  <p>  As part of its efforts to develop a comprehensive strategy to address the refugee crisis, the EU organised two high level conferences earlier this year.  On 8 October, a conference focusing on migration flows into the EU through the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route took place in Luxembourg attended by both JHA and Foreign Ministers.  The Conference issued a Declaration endorsing a five-pronged approach to addressing the migration challenge. <\/p>  <p>  On 11\/12 November EU Heads of State and Government met their African counterparts at a migration summit in Valletta.  They agreed to establish a Trust Fund to address the root causes of migration in Africa.  The &euro;1.8 billion Fund is to be augmented by EU member state contributions. Ireland is contributing &euro;3m. <\/p>  <p>  On 29 November, there was a key meeting of EU Heads of Government with Turkey in Brussels at which the EU agreed to provide a financial package worth &euro;3 billion to help Turkey accommodate the more than two million refugees residing in the country.  As part of the agreement there is to be a concerted effort by Turkey to stem the flow of irregular migrants through its territory. This agreement &ndash; or Joint Plan of Action &ndash; presents a real opportunity to stem the flow of such migrants into the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[45615\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide additional funding for humanitarian aid for Syria and adjoining areas in view of the ongoing conflict, the appalling loss of life and the urgent need to get essential humanitarian aid to persons living in desperate conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":388,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[45616\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will raise at the next European Union Foreign Affairs Council the need for the European Union to provide additional funding to Syria and that region given the ongoing conflict, the appalling loss of lives and the urgent need to get humanitarian aid to persons living in desperate conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":389,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together.<\/p>  <p>  The world now faces unprecedented levels of humanitarian crisis, driven by conflict, chronic instability, and economic and environmental shocks.  Globally, there are now more than 59 million people displaced, more than at any time since the Second World War. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is firmly committed to responding to the humanitarian needs of those affected by these crises.  Our most significant humanitarian contribution in recent years has been for the people affected by the appalling conflict in Syria, which has created the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis.  More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed, 6.6 million people are displaced within Syria, and over 4.2 million have had to flee the country in search of safety.  Some 13.5 million people, well over half of Syria&rsquo;s population, are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is particularly mindful of the impact of the crisis on Syria&rsquo;s immediate neighbours &ndash; Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq &ndash; which have been generous hosts to huge numbers of desperate people, putting huge strain on their own resources. <\/p>  <p>  We have been supporting efforts to assist refugees affected by the Syria crisis, providing needs-based humanitarian assistance since 2012. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian aid is implemented by our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners, and has helped to provide food, shelter and medical care to those who need it. <\/p>  <p>  At the Pledging Conference in Kuwait in March 2015, Ireland pledged &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance for the Syrian crisis this year.  Earlier this week, I announced an additional package of &euro;2.95 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region, bringing the total given in 2015 to &euro;13 million. <\/p>  <p>  With the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance within Syria greatly exceeding the number of refugees who have fled their home country, I have ensured that half of this package is focused on their needs. <\/p>  <p>  With more than 2 million children in Syria, and 700,000 across the region not in school, there is a high risk of creating a generation of under-qualified and disaffected youth.  To support the No Lost Generation initiative, which supports education, child protection and engagement of adolescents in their communities, &euro;1 million goes to UNICEF. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, &euro;500,000 goes to UNICEF in Jordan for water and sanitation work in the Azraq refugee camp, improving living conditions for Syrian refugees there, and increasing sustainability in this long drawn out crisis. <\/p>  <p>  By the end of 2015, Ireland will have provided over &euro;42 million to the Syrian people since the beginning of the crisis. I am determined that Ireland will continue to provide appropriate humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people. <\/p>  <p>  The Syria crisis remains high on the European agenda. On 23 September last, an Emergency European Council was held to address the crisis, resulting in further funding being given.  Since then, the European Council of 15 October, and the informal European Council of 15 November have discussed the crisis in the context of migration.  The Foreign Affairs Councils of 12 October and 16 November both featured Syria prominently on their agendas. <\/p>  <p>  The EU, collectively, is the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian donor, and has been a leading donor in response to the Syrian crisis.  The EU (European Commission and Member States) has provided some &euro;4.4 billion in humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people since the beginning of this crisis.  This crisis will remain on the EU&rsquo;s agenda, and will remain a humanitarian priority for the EU, as it is for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":391,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Funding","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT01200"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[45521\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"following the publication of Innovation 2020, the amount of her 2016 departmental budget which she will allocate to basic research under the new Frontier Research Fund; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":392,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[45524\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121600092#WRT01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"following the publication of Innovation 2020, the persons who will be allowed to apply under the new Frontier Research Fund, when applications will open and close, the amount of moneys that have been allocated for this fund over the course of the strategy, by year, the maximum grant amount that can be drawn down per year, the type of grants that will be dispersed, including Ph.D and post-doctoral research, the scientific disciplines which will be accommodated for grant funding; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":393,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.<\/p>  <p>  Under Innovation 2020 a new competitive fund to support researchers to undertake project-based frontier research, and to develop as Principal Investigators, is to be established by the Irish Research Council.
