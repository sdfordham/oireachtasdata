The society represents the interests of more than 700 members, predominantly professional foresters but including, through its associate and student membership, a wide cross-section of people involved in or with an interest in the forest and timber industry.  Members of the society work across all areas of the forest industry &ndash; State sector, semi-State sector, private forestry companies, forestry consultants, forestry contracting, nurseries, the timber processing sector and investment companies.<\/p><p>  The Society of Irish Foresters places great emphasis on promoting professional standards in forestry among its members and the regulation of the forestry profession.  To this end, members of the Society of Irish Foresters are bound by its code of ethics and professional conduct.  The society also influences forestry education in Ireland with a view to maintaining the highest professional standards.  A system of continuous professional development is maintained for its professional members.<\/p><p>  The society was very pleased with the response of the committee to its submission on Coillte's harvesting rights.<\/p><p>  The Forestry Bill should support the implementation of the strategic actions arising from the Irish forest policy review process, which is currently at draft phase for public consultation.  In that context, the Bill may be somewhat premature as it is unknown what changes, if any, will be made to the draft.  Nevertheless, one has to assume that an expansion of the forest resource area will continue.<\/p><p>  The society notes a number of omissions from the Bill which it believes should be included, the first of which is research.  One should assume that good forestry practice and the protection of the environment is grounded on contemporary research in forestry and related matters.  Furthermore, the industry is facing challenges such as diseases like chalara and phytophthora, impact from climate change, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021100003#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pacelli Breathnach","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392131700,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Has the society made a written submission to the Minister?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021100004#F00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392131700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021100004#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pacelli Breathnach"},{"type":"speech","time":1392131700,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Is the society's submission to the Minister more detailed than what it has presented to the committee and is Mr. Breathnach willing to make a copy available to us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021100004#F00400","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392131700,"counter":16,"content":"<p>We have given the committee a more detailed written submission based on our submission to the Minister, but we can also supply a copy of the latter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021100004#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pacelli Breathnach"},{"type":"speech","time":1392131700,"counter":17,"content":"<p>As an Opposition spokesperson who intends to table amendments to the Bill, I am listening carefully to submissions and keeping all of the documents presented to us.

Forestry is a vital piece of the carbon jigsaw and we have not reached our targets.  We were supposed to plant 15,000 trees but have planted only 7,000.  One Deputy mentioned aqua-land as opposed to agri-land.  My father&rsquo;s place, which is on the side of the River Suir, is half forestry, half farm and is spectacularly badly flooded, to the point that one wonders whether the trees will survive but they survive beautifully.  Maybe this could provide an answer for land now affected by flooding for the first time.  This will be part of our business in the future.<\/p><p>  Are we competitive with Food Harvest 2020?

It is impossible to answer his question until we see what comes out of the strategic review.  However, I shall make a broad statement.  It has been some time since we had a Forestry Bill. The legislation has been eight years in the making and it is six years since consultation.  Therefore, my personal view is that there is no massive urgency on pushing the Bill through until we have seen the strategic review which is more imminent.  Once we see it, and gain a better understanding of the vision for the industry going forward, we can then work on a Bill that will give enabling powers to the Minister to exercise and achieve that vision.<\/p><p>  The single biggest issue and challenge facing the forestry industry at present is mobilising the private forest industry.  The State and private growers have invested billions of euro into creating a forest resource.  A lot of it is now mature but it is very slow to reach market.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned ECC in Corr na M&oacute;na and the other sawmills that are always crying out for additional volume.  My own business, Imperative Energy, develops bioenergy facilities around the country and constantly faces difficulties in getting sufficient volume to support its development needs.  <\/p><p>  The potential for job creation and creating economic activity in the private forest industry must be built on to the mobilisation of the private forestry asset.  That is why we need a strategic vision for the industry and a supportive Bill that will help grease the tracks to get that material to market and then economic and social benefits can flow from such an initiative.  The Bill contains very little to grease the tracks and is more about imposing barriers and constraints on the industry.  <\/p><p>  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the management plan.  Again, the wording of the Bill very much suggests that everything will be written, that the Minister will write seeking a management plan and the forest owners will be obliged to submit a management plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021100007#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392134100,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The general trend is along that line of thought.  The issues raised by all of the delegates have a common thread running through them, with slightly different perspectives, particularly on the management plan which should include the felling licence.  Others have stated there should also be an indication of replanting intentions before the clear felling licence is granted.  From the point of view of efficiencies within the process, apart from the timelines involved, if the objectives are achieved, whereby there are extra forest plantations, the current administrative structure is already under pressure.  On limiting it to five year licences and making all of the other demands on the system, the only aspect in respect of which there is a deadline concerns the supply of information within 28 days.  Some of us met the officials and suggested a period of 90 days; the delegates have suggested 12 weeks, which is more or less the same.  There are many common threads running through the submissions of the various interest groups in the sector which I hope have been fed to the departmental officials and the Minister.  We have found the officials receptive to the submissions made so far.  The Minister is due to appear before the committee on 25 February to take Committee Stage and the points made have been well noted.  One of the fundamental issues in the forest industry is that one cannot grow trees without foresters.  For that reason, we were keen to have the Society of Irish Foresters which represents qualified foresters to appear before the committee to get its perspective on the issues involved.  <\/p><p>  This has been a useful meeting.  As this is a public meeting the issues discussed will feed into the debate.  As this is the last submission to be made at this stage, we will ask the departmental officials to read the transcripts of all the submissions and presentations made to the committee and take on board the concerns expressed.  They centre on the issues of replanting and management plans and are not at odds.  Only rarely have the submissions made been at great odds with each other.  Much commonsense has been demonstrated by many delegates and I expect much of what has been said to be taken on board.  That is my request to the officials.<\/p><p>  I thank the delegates for their attendance and making their presentation to the committee.  This marks the conclusion of our hearings on the Forestry Bill 2013.

I will give some background on why and how we established LinkedFinance.  I originally came up with the idea when Martin McAleese ran Your Country, Your Call in 2010.  I could see at the time that small businesses were struggling to access finance.  I had run a printing business in the past and it is notoriously difficult to raise finance to run such businesses.  When I did some research I saw that the SME loan book in Ireland was approximately &euro;46 billion while household deposits were nearly &euro;90 billion, even though the country was having a very hard time.  Therefore household deposits were double the requirement for SME lending.  I thought if one could release some of those funds or make it attractive for members of the public to lend to business it might be a good idea.<\/p><p>  When I did some research I found that crowdfunding had been invented in Ireland in 1720 by Jonathan Swift.  He had a very simple idea.  He ran the Irish loan fund and put &euro;500 of his own money in.  At the time a peasant farmer could not borrow money in Ireland.  The idea was that he would lend money from this fund to a peasant farmer as long as two of his neighbours were prepared to stand behind him as guarantors on the loan.  The idea was that if the borrower defaulted or ran away to Australia, these two neighbours would step up and take up the loan on behalf of the borrower.  We did a little research and there had been no defaults because the most shameful thing one could do back then was to disgrace oneself and bring one's neighbours in on it.<\/p><p>  A modern-day equivalent is a company called Zopa.com.  Established in 2005 it has loaned &euro;400 million so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021100003#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392126000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Mahony for his presentation.

Our typical business would be a business that has been trading for at least two years.  The main reason for this strategy is that we have a duty of care to our lenders.  Our lenders are members of the public and we have nearly 5,000 registered lenders.  We carry out the credit and identity checks that one would expect a bank to do on a bank loan, and it is very difficult to do that in a start-up situation.  Our plan for the future is that we would get involved in lending to start-up businesses.  Ideally, it would be on a co-funded basis, such as funding those in receipt of grants under the Leader programme, from Enterprise Ireland or from the local enterprise boards.  We do not have the personnel in place to provide that all-important mentorship for start-up businesses.  It is on our roadmap but, as Senator Quinn said, we do not lend to start-up businesses at present.  We also feel there is quite a lot of money in Ireland for start-up businesses, particularly for technology start ups, with the support of Enterprise Ireland, and even regular businesses receive support from Microfinance Ireland.  Our belief is that businesses that have been in operation for 18 months to three years are only getting started but need extra capital to move to the next level.<\/p><p>  The British tax system is more flexible with regard to using pension funds or ISAs to invest in crowdfunding or peer-to-peer lending.  That does not exist in Ireland.  Se&aacute;n O'Sullivan from \"Dragons' Den\" suggested as part of the recent report from the Irish Entrepreneurship Forum that the Government should put an initiative in place to support crowdfunding by allowing people to earn up to &euro;10,000 in interest every year without having to pay tax.  That would be a fantastic kick-start for businesses.  Apparently the reaction from Government was positive and this is an idea that might be implemented.  <\/p><p>  Senator Quinn asked about the possibility of Ireland's becoming a hub for crowdfunding.  As I said, it really does not have a home anywhere.  There are two major companies based in San Francisco.  I have met people from both of them and they are considering coming to Europe.  The remaining companies are scattered over the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021100004#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392126600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I must advise that if a phone is located near the microphone it will have a negative effect.

The reason we called our organisation LinkedFinance was that we wanted the borrower to link with the customers.  Our average borrower at the moment has 186 lenders.  For a &euro;30,000 loan, the average person bids &euro;150 to lend to that business and, on average,  between 180 and 200 people will be involved in each loan.  As the Senator mentioned, it is a great opportunity for people to start being loyal and provide support to a business.  Let us say a loan goes live today; the first repayment will be due in a month's time.  We have lent to a couple of butchers, and one of these, who had a loan that went live last July, very cleverly said \"Thank you for supporting me on the loan.  The first repayment will go through tomorrow and, by the way, if you want to pop in to pick up any meat for your barbecue this weekend, there is a 20% discount for every lender who has lent to me.\"  That butcher had a great take-up on his offer.  Such lending creates a bond.  It is important that the lender likes the borrower, but it is also important that the borrower likes the lender.  Let us say that butcher was going through a tough time and the time for his monthly payment is fast approaching; he will decide not to bounce a cheque because the lenders are also customers, and the last thing that butcher wants is dissatisfied customers.  We feel that the link between the lender and the borrowers is key.<\/p><p>  With regard to the business going forward, members of the public lend through the platform and by creating a link we feel that we are driving defaults virtually down to zero.  In our industry the number of defaults is typically very low.  For example, Zopa has lent nearly &euro;200 million in the past three years and its default rate is 0.3% on all of the loans.  That is down to the community effect, whereby borrowers suddenly feel very responsible in terms of repaying the money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021100005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1392126600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Deputy Dara Calleary sends his apologies.

It is good because it democratises the ability for people to loan money.  Also, shocking though it is, there are people who are investing in property again in order to provide for their future.  Crowdfunding offers a mechanism for investing in a productive element of the market.<\/p><p>  I have a few questions.  What is the typical length of loans?  Is there an average duration for a loan, in the witnesses' experience?  With regard to accessibility for SMEs, is the knowledge level on the sector high among SMEs or businesses?  Mr. O'Mahony mentioned a lot of figures.  Does he have comparative figures on the volume of such loans in, for example, the United States?  Mr. O'Mahony mentioned the level of default.  How has the amount of default grown?  Is it a level growth?  Is it a continuous growth?  Have there been peaks over the past number of years?<\/p><p>  Interest rates provide equilibrium in terms of demand versus supply.  Is there enough supply, in his experience?  What is his view on the regulation of the sector?  What are the barriers to growth, in his experience?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021100005#E00700","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392126600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first question was on the terms of loans.  All of our loans are three years in duration and are fully amortised, which means 36 equal repayments with every repayment having interest and capital added.  The difference between our loan and that of a bank is that there are absolutely no penalties for early settlement.  Therefore, if a business decides that it does not need a loan any more because there is a cheaper alternative, or for whatever reason, all it must do is pay back the outstanding capital.  There are no penalties for settling early.  That is important in order to give a business a bit of flexibility.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's second question was whether SMEs know about the service.  When we launched last March, if we were in a room that contained 100 people we would have felt that fewer than ten of those people would have heard of crowdfunding or peer-to-peer lending.  The situation is different now.  Last week we made a presentation to the Tralee Chamber of Commerce with 150 people present, and I feel that more than 50% of those present would have heard of crowdfunding, participated in some type of crowdfunding, watched something about it on television or seen it in the press.  Crowdfunding is becoming more known in the sector.  We spend a lot of time trying to inform people and we meet representatives of chambers of commerce, SMEs, ISME, the Small Firms Association and their memberships.  I have planned the business since 2010 and everybody I met on the run-up to its launch said I would find it very hard to get people to lend through the site because nobody trusts the systems any more, but that there would be a very lengthy queue of borrowers down the road vying to borrow.  Sadly, we do not have a huge queue of borrowers, because most SMEs have got used to surviving without capital, which is not a good thing.  Instead, they are using  personal resources such as credit cards, extending their credit terms with suppliers and that type of thing.  That is what is being used for cashflow.  The biggest message that is difficult to get out is that an organisation will not have to wait eight or 11 weeks for a decision; we will make a decision in two or three working days.  That is the biggest barrier we have come across in the marketplace - that businesses have become resigned to the fact that capital is not available.<\/p><p>  With regard to the volume of loans, when we first started in March we provided one loan every two weeks of about &euro;30,000 or thereabouts.  Last week we did three loans and we hope to do four loans this week, which means we are very close to providing a loan a day.  As a business model, a loan a day can very easily become two or five loans a day.  We are very happy that we are on target for where we wanted to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021100005#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392127200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Do we know who will be the regulator in England?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021100006#F00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392127200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>The Office of Fair Trading will be part of it and also the Financial Services Authority, FSA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021100006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1392127200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Mahony believe there are any other barriers to growth?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021100006#F00400","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392127200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>There are no restrictions in place that would be a barrier to this sector growing.

In terms of what Government could do, we have some great agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia, that could engage more with the sector.  Bord Bia would be a great example because food and food retail businesses would be very popular on our site.  I suppose it is because the 200 lenders, as Senator Quinn said, can get behind those brands and support them.  If someone is looking at Killowen Yogurt, which borrows through our site, they can actually see it on the shelves of Tesco, Marks and Spencer or Superquinn.  They are really buying into the brand.  In my case, I had never tried Killowen Yogurt before it borrowed on the site but it is the only yogurt we have in the house now.  There are many Government agencies we could work with and help some of these companies because lending &euro;100 to a yogurt company makes one an ambassador for life.  My children now know the brands that borrow through LinkedFinance because their products are now in our shopping trolley.

I met Mr. Conor McAleese, who is not with us today, at an enterprise show in the RDS.  As it happened, we had known each other many years previously but we got chatting.  At the time we were in the process of developing our facility in Sandyford and ploughing money back into the business.  In the best traditions of enthusiastic entrepreneurs we had done all the work.  We decided that as we had put all our work and capital into this investment we had better put a few bob back into liquidity.  We borrowed the money.  We had talked to our own bank, which shall remain nameless, about it.  We had a good deal of love-bombing, so to speak, but no results.  We put in an application.  It was sent back to these anonymous underwriters, the people who live in the IFSC who do not have names or faces in the way bank personnel used to have names and faces.

We have a borrower who has a retail outlet on Liffey Street.  He opened in 2010, when the snows came, and for two weeks did not have one customer through the door.  He went to the bank and said he needed to pay wages on a Friday and asked to borrow &euro;1,500 to pay his staff.  Eleven weeks later, he was refused a loan.  He made the decision there and then that he would never use mainstream banking again.  He would save money before buying anything and handed back his credit card machine.  All he uses his bank account for is to pay suppliers who insist on being paid by transfer or cheque.  Before we met this man, he had been saving up &euro;5,000 over six months and then buying a new fridge and then saving for another six months and buying a new counter.  When he met us, that allowed him to borrow &euro;30,000 in one go to open a second retail outlet and employ 11 people.  He did not have to save for six or nine months.  Not everybody is like him, but we have other borrowers who have borrowed &euro;25,000 from us.  They were told by the banks that they would be given &euro;25,000 for their business and that the banks wanted to support them, but they needed to put &euro;25,000 in a deposit account as security against the loan.  Obviously, if the business person had the &euro;25,000 in the first place, he or she would not have needed to borrow.<\/p><p>  We are not the lender of last resort, nor are we just meeting people who have been turned down.  We are meeting people who want to get things done quickly.  They might have a van that is in trouble and needs to be replaced and they cannot wait eight weeks or survive without making deliveries for that lenght of time.  They want to move quickly.  It is a kind of social business.  Mr. Vander Elst's and Ms Redden's business is in the green energy area - electric bikes.  The people who lent to them would love that business because it is a socially conscious business that is better for the environment and so on.<\/p><p>  A question was asked about who was lending or the type of people who were lending.  We have no millionaires.  The average loan bid is &euro;146, a tiny payment.  They are people like the rest of us, ordinary guys on the street.  If we profile the average person lending on the site, it is a man between 40 and 55 years of age.  The average person has deposited just under &euro;2,000 for lending - small money.  Everything we do on the site is about diversifying the risk.  If somebody puts &euro;1,000 on the website, everything on it would tell him to put &euro;50, the minimum bid, into 20 businesses, rather than put &euro;500 into two.  Some of our businesses will fail, without question.  We guarantee that will happen.  What we do not want is for somebody to put half of his or her funds into one business.  Ideally, he should put &euro;50 into 20 businesses and if one of the businesses fails, he or she will still have 19 performing loans.  <\/p><p>  The profile of the people lending on the site has not changed since day one.  It is a great mix of people, which is what we want.  Therefore, we have a business like Greenaer which deals with what consumers want, with customers who can make offers on its bikes or see a trade exhibition and so on.  Businesses like Mr. McMonagle's are similar.  He is supplying vets up and down the country.  One of his lenders might have a sister or a brother-in-law who is a vet and this might open a door for him.  There are always such opportunities, which is why we called it Linked Finance to try to link borrowers and lenders.<\/p><p>  With regard to start-ups, it is not until we become more established that we can deal with them because it is very hard for us to make an informed decision on whether a start-up business will succeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021100007#G01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392128400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Would some of the businesses have other business loans as well?

Ideally, we look for people who may have had multiple loans and we can see how well their repayment schedules have worked.  Deputy Kyne asked whether the businesses have existing loans.

In the early days we made the mistake, or otherwise, of not having an overdraft from our bank.  We operated on a prudent basis and grew the business probably more slowly than we could have if we had had an overdraft.  The irony of it was that when the business started to grow and we needed to get an overdraft, the bank would not give it to us, and there was plenty of cashflow.  All it would say was that it wanted us to take a term loan and turn that into an overdraft.  That did not really suit our business.  It seems the banks have a pot of money to give in overdrafts and, because they do not know how much any of their candidates will draw down at any one time, they are reluctant to earmark money that may or may not be drawn down at any particular time.  They like to have the certainty of a loan.  That did not really suit us in the sense that we did not want to take out a long-term facility.<\/p><p>  We have an existing loan for a car for a sales representative, which is through Skoda Finance, where we sourced the car, but we had trouble convincing the bank that we were worthy of an overdraft because we had not had one previously.  That, to say the least, was fairly annoying because it is a profitable business and we had been with that bank for ten years.  The bank also has my wife's business, our mortgage and our personal accounts.  They know everything about us, which, in retrospect, is probably not good.  With LinkedFinance, we went, we made the case and the job was done.  I am still waiting to hear from a bank about the loan.  I do not have time for that; business moves too quickly.

It is difficult for an entrepreneur to do that.  All business people in Ireland have got used to the fact that if you want to apply for a loan, you have to fill out an eight-page form.  If you are working hard and doing a full 12-hour day, you are coming home in the evening to face this form that is just an unending list of questions for you to fill out.<\/p><p>  We are different.  The quickest our loan application form has ever been filled out is 37 seconds, and we have a timer on the website.  What we are trying to do there is get rid of all the friction in signing up.  However, it is hard, until we are fully established, for businesses to realise that there will not be an eight-page form to fill out.  A business owner may send the form to the bank, fold his or her arms and think the job is done, but the bank will come back to him or her two weeks later looking for supplementary information, and then it will change the rules on what it was looking for in the first place and how the business owner will guarantee the loan.  We have tried to make the application as simple as possible.  On day one, our application form was four pages long.  We found that 60% to 70% of the applicants were skipping out of the website or leaving our website on page 2.  Therefore, we sat down and had the brainwave of making it a two-page application form.  But then, of course, everyone left on page 1.  What we did thereafter was to have a single-page application form, and one can go through all the fields in less than a minute.  That gets one onto the system and allows one to understand what we will be looking for as supplementary information, and we give the full list.  We never ask for anything in excess of what we have listed as the documents we will require to put the loan together.  It is a learning curve.  For me, as an entrepreneur over the years, filling out those long forms was just an absolute headache.<\/p><p>  Regardless of crowd-funding, it would be helpful if the pillar banks standardised their forms so that when I apply for a loan, I could fill out one form, photocopy it, drop it in to the four or five different banks and get them competing against each other for my business.  At present, all the formats are different and the information required is in a different layout.  It would be simple to do.  I accept it would be a big printing job, but it would be simple to standardise the application form for a loan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021100008#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1392128400,"counter":83,"content":"<p>That has been done, more or less.

In a lot of cases, as was mentioned earlier, people who are lending are friends and family.  We obviously do not want to place any restriction on that.  I mentioned a butcher earlier to whom we lent.  He did his barbecues during the summer.  He had a fantastic butchery business and his father always wanted to support him in the business but the son was too proud and would not take cash from him.  This was a perfect vehicle for him, so in the last hours of the auction be bid &euro;6,000 in three lots of &euro;2,000 to support his son in the business.  We do not restrict from that point of view because as Deputy Murphy described, he is looking at an auction which is 100% funded.  So if somebody was looking for &euro;20,000 and it is 100% funded, every new bid that comes in the market is going to bump out an expensive interest rate.  The top rate of interest at that time might be 12%.  If one wants to come into the loan now, one must bid at least 11.9% and move that bidder out.  On a &euro;20,000 loan, we find that &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 might be bid in the last hour or half an hour, as people try to become part of it and bump other people in the market out of it.  In the butcher's case, his father was doing that for the last couple of hours of the auction.  He was picking an interest rate and putting &euro;2,000 in.  He wanted to lend &euro;6,000 and only ended up lending &euro;3,500 because he got bumped out just before the thing ended.  We would actively encourage it.

Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Sullivan from \"Dragons' Den\" proposed the idea that a lender should be able to earn &euro;10,000 in interest per year before paying tax at the marginal rate.

It is a major undertaking and a very good one.  Many of us have been concerned and curious about issues in rolling out the metering project, the decision-making process around it and the efforts to set up this utility.  There were serious concerns expressed earlier about outside expertise and I thank the delegates for their appearance at the meeting held in January.  By and large, there was a good flow of information - no pun intended - between Uisce &Eacute;ireann and the committee.  In many ways, it satisfied much of the curiosity.  The hallmark of this project is transparency and we are anxious to do everything we can to advance that concept.<\/p><p>  A number of issues will be raised in respect of the establishment of the utility.  There is a certain level of curiosity and people tend to presume when there is no information available.  In so far as it can be established, we will deal with issues concerning pricing.  We are aware that households are cash-strapped and anxious to establish that the commission and the board of Uisce &Eacute;ireann are mindful of this in setting prices.  <\/p><p>  With regard to local authority staff now working with Uisce &Eacute;ireann, I understand completely the service level agreements between trade unions and organisations.  Some people do not understand this and do not want to.  However, as a committee, we must be satisfied that people with the appropriate skills set from local authorities are doing exactly what it says on the tin.  Irish Water is not in the public sector in the conventional sense, as it is a semi-State commercial company.  There will always be issues relating to people working in the public sphere who then transfer to another area.  In an era when employment is scarce, any variance in a switch in remuneration is like a red rag to a bull.  It will be beneficial to the committee and the board of Uisce &Eacute;ireann to establish this.  <\/p><p>  We will engage in a robust question and answer session after the opening statements and I believe all members will offer to speak.

The purpose of Irish Water is to safeguard water as a precious natural resource and deliver water services in a way that meets the needs of all citizens now and into the future.  In doing this, it will deliver a standardised asset management approach across 34 local authorities, drive efficiencies, improve customer service, ramp up the delivery of capital projects and raise international capital to help to deliver much needed investment in the sector.<\/p><p>  I want to refer to our seven key messages before synopsising what is included in the paper.  Ireland&rsquo;s water and wastewater infrastructure does not meet the needs of a modern economy and there are significant quality, environmental and service challenges.  Irish Water has been established to put the structure and systems in place to address this challenge.  In 2009 the water services investment programme would have cost &euro;6 billion to implement.

The establishment of Irish Water as a national utility will secure improved water services by bringing a systematic approach to how we operate and manage services, centralising and standardising procurement and other activities to deliver major cost savings, adopting best project management practices to reduce the capital needed for projects, while accelerating their delivery within budget, delivering the largest metering programme for a water utility, and implementing a system of charging and collecting revenues from over 1.8 million customers.

CER's role covers the networks, wholesale markets and retail markets.  We were appointed on 7 February 2013 as economic regulator for Uisce &Eacute;ireann, and CER covers water and waste water services.  Our role in broad terms is to protect the interests of consumers and this sets the framework for all our other activities.  We will regulate the network costs of Uisce &Eacute;ireann and ensure they are efficient.  Networks are a natural monopoly.  There is a standard model for networks in energy and water.  We will set the costs through price controls, and we will use standard international processes for establishing the price controls.<\/p><p>  Price controls ensure that standards are imposed on the functions, and also that sufficient capital is achieved at the lowest cost from the consumer point of view.  Water and energy services are very capital-intensive industries and controlling capital costs is as important for water services as it is for energy services.  It is important that capital is sourced at a low cost.  Price controls provide a stable environment and that environment ensures we can build in targets and efficiencies to improve delivery for consumers.  We have introduced seven price controls in the energy sector in the past 14 years in both the electricity and gas services.  As a result, operating costs have decreased and performance has improved.  We have set targets which have been achieved and exceeded.  This has allowed us to get efficient capital from capital markets, which is an important factor in capital-intensive industries.<\/p><p>  My colleague Mr. Paul McGowan will focus on the CER's role in the provision of water services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100005#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392129600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>The Water Services Act 2013 sets out that CER's function in respect of water is to protect the interests of customers.

The legislation also places other duties on CER, and these are listed in the documentation.  It should also be noted that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has the power to issue directions to the Commission for Energy Regulation under this legislation.<\/p><p>  The codes of practice will be one of the key instruments that CER will use to regulate the interface between the consumer and Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will submit codes of practice on customer-service-related issues to CER for approval.  These codes of practice will make provision for issues such as standards for Uisce &Eacute;ireann in performing its functions.  Standards will be set for communication and service to customers as well as water quality.  The codes of practice will also cover the billing of customers for water services and how that should be done, the methods of payment available to its customers, information to be provided to customers in communications from Uisce &Eacute;ireann, how customers should go about making complaints, and any other matter the CER considers necessary to protect the interests of Uisce &Eacute;ireann customers.  It is expected and will be a requirement that the codes of practice are freely available online and accessible to customers and that the CER can issue a direction to Uisce &Eacute;ireann to comply with those codes.<\/p><p>  The CER will consult upon the codes of practice and other issues during 2014 and has set out timeframes for this.

How will the CER be able to satisfy itself on the costs that Uisce &Eacute;ireann incurs, such as the cost of capital?  We know, for example, that all customers will be given a free allowance, so how will charging be structured?  Who will determine what is sufficient capital for Uisce &Eacute;ireann?

We are going about this by looking at international experience.  In the first instance, it involves benchmarking, or looking at what happened when new utilities were established in other jurisdictions.  We examine how much that cost and determine whether the costs being incurred here are reasonable in that context.

We are keen to have dialogue with other regulators to learn from their experiences and share our own.  There is additional complexity, but I am satisfied that it is not insurmountable.

Specifically, Irish Water suggests that 34 local authorities managing &euro;11 billion worth of assets does not deliver the required economies of scale at present.  The lack of standardisation in how plants are operated and services delivered leads to a variable quality and added costs.  Irish Water goes on to say that it will identify priority areas nationally that require focus and investment to solve problems.  Does Mr. Tierney accept this is very similar to the sort of comment made in the establishment of the HSE?

Mr. Tierney can note that one.  On staffing levels, as Mr. Tierney knows, Irish Water has entered into a 12-year service level agreement with 34 local authorities and the staff of local authorities conducting work under these arrangements will remain local authority members.  The head count for 2014 for service level agreements is 4,320, but will Irish Water also employ an additional 520 staff?  Irish Water and others have continued to state that they will achieve &euro;2 billion in cost efficiencies by 2021.  The ESRI report by Dr. FitzGerald estimated excessive staffing costs if staffing levels went beyond 1,700.  However, I am not sure that 1,700 figure was crystallised.  Dr. FitzGerald referred to Scotland and I understand the water authority in Scotland has 4,000 staff, not 1,700.  What is Irish Water's position on these figures?  Does he think a staff of 1,700 is sufficient or does he think we require 4,000 or 4,800 or for how long should this be the case?  Has Irish Water carried out any assessment of natural wastage or the loss of staff over time and what the position will be by 2021?  Is it correct that Irish Water staff will benefit from a bonus system similar to that in the parent body, Bord G&aacute;is, and will be eligible for payments up to &euro;7,000?  Will bonus payment criteria and numbers be made available publicly over time?<\/p><p>  My main query relates to the &euro;2 billion efficiencies that Irish Water, the Taoiseach and the Minister have said will be achieved by 2021.  What percentage of that &euro;2 billion is made up of water charges?  What will the savings be if staffing levels remain in place?  In other words, the &euro;2 billion savings has two elements, water charges and savings relating to staff.  Has Irish Water calculated these or can it give us an estimation or indication of these savings?<\/p><p>  I guess the issue of water pricing relates to the regulator.  Unfortunately, I must refer to the set up cost of &euro;185 million and the &euro;82 million within that for consultancy costs.  The Department says it dealt directly with Irish Water in regard to the submission it made to establish and agree those costs before making them available to Bord G&aacute;is when it went about the process of setting up Irish Water.  The Minister has explained that he would not have had access to the minute detail of those figures, although he said he passed them on to the regulator.  Correct me if I am wrong, but is Mr. McGowan quoted directly in saying that on his initial review of the establishment costs last year, he was not aware of the amount involved in consultancy costs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100008#K00900","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392131400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I will answer that immediately.

The assumption, as I read it, was that 20% could be taken out of costs over five years.  If we apply that <i>pro rata<\/i> in respect of staffing, it does not bring us to a figure of 1,700 because it depends on which way we devise the model.  If the model is being devised as I believe Professor FitzGerald set out, on the basis of 1,700 staff in the local authorities with another quantum of staff in an outsourced model, then one would have to take the total head count involved in delivering the same services as today.  That would be a figure far greater than 1,700.  We should bear in mind that there would still be 2,600 other staff left in the local authorities without the job they have today in water services.  Therefore, technically, we would have much greater overall cost to the economy by dealing with simply one part of the equation in that fashion.<\/p><p>  We produced figures around the initial experience in Britain which, over ten years, saw reductions of staffing in the order of 21.5%.  We have referred to Scotland previously.  What we should remember about Scotland is that the set-up there does not include the billing aspect within its staffing numbers.  Scotland did not get the levels down as far as 1,700 directly in any such length of time.<\/p><p>  I suppose the position is that many things will have an impact on staff numbers over time.  The committee members will be well aware and would agree that the local government sector, probably more than any other sector within the public sector, has contributed to the reductions in respect of staffing and costs.  I cannot remember the figure exactly but I gather that the sector accounted for 12% of the staff but almost 25% of the reductions.  It is nothing new for local government to be dealing with these issues.  If we are to analyse the service in terms of what is ultimately needed, let us remember that we are coming from a reduced number already as of 1 January 2014.  We have 2,000 plants throughout the country.  It will take analysis and investment but there will be situations whereby, as the committee has rightly pointed out, we will have natural attrition through retirements and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100009#L03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Tierney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392132600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Mr. Tierney is telling us &euro;2 billion over seven years.

Is it the case that the regulator does not have the power to intervene in this respect?  What type of restrictions apply to the regulator?  I am puzzled about this.  How does the regulator explain the huge gap that has opened up between the operational costs - I do not doubt, as was said, the impact if they have been reduced in real terms - and increased efficiencies there and, on the other hand, the massive increase in costs across the energy sector?  Our energy bills have skyrocketed in the past 14 years.  What has the regulator done to regulate that sector and rein in those costs? Has it not had the power to do that, or what is the position?

In regard to gas and electricity, it is probably worth noting that when we started regulating both of those industries, particularly electricity, they had suffered from decades of under-investment.  During the past decade or more there was massive investment in the electricity infrastructure in order to bring it up to the standard that is required in a modern economy.  That has been a driver for cost increases, undoubtedly, in the energy area.  The second point is that, unlike water, the price of energy is very much driven by the price of fuel, predominantly gas, in international markets.  That is completely outside the control of the State or the regulator.  We are price takers.  We have to accept the international wholesale price for gas, for example, which in the case of Ireland is pretty much set in Great Britain at what is called the national balancing point, which is their wholesale market.  Those costs have been rising over the years.  We have investigated and looked at the costs of delivering both the capital investment and operating expenditure of Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB and the backdrop to that has been rising fuel prices and a massive investment programme in order to bring both electricity and gas networks up to international standards and, for example, to ensure that the amount of minutes lost by customers who are attached to the electricity network has decreased since we took over as regulator.  That probably reflects the level of investment that was necessary to improve the overall system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100012#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1392133800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.

We have an enormous responsibility to make sure that everything is transparent and crystal clear in how we do this and in the steps being taken by this committee, Irish Water and the regulator.  To be clear on the timeline involved, the first factor is a price control submission, and this is a question for Irish Water.

These services very often have lead pipes that often are in poor condition.  A fair amount of work has been done in starting to remedy such services.  It is complicated and expensive work because one must put a pipe in the front and mould services to the back of the houses.  Certainly over a relatively short time - it probably will take ten years - we hope to eliminate all such common services through a programme of work.  As I stated, this will take out the issues of lead and leakages and is improving the service and in so doing makes such properties available for metering purposes.  Clearly, they are not amenable to metering at present.<\/p><p>  In respect of apartments and other multi-use properties, Irish Water has carried out some pilot work on the potential for the metering of apartments.  It is a highly complicated task because buildings of different type and from different ages have all kinds of plumbing systems.  For example, some apartment buildings have approximately three separate feeds to different parts of the system in individual apartments.  A percentage of multi-occupation buildings have individual stop cocks at the front and can be metered.

It is not particularly good, however, on things like burst history, condition and fragility of the pipe.  It certainly does not pinpoint leakages.  <\/p><p>  In terms of sewers, we are not in such a good place.  There is a certain amount of information available on the GIS and mapping which we have started to pull together.  By the end of 2014, we expect to have all existing data on the layout and whatever information is available on all underground assets.  However, there will be big gaps, particularly on the sewerage side.  <\/p><p>  In terms of treatment plants, there is a lot of publicly available information that we have collected which arises from the Environmental Protection Agency's reporting on drinking water quality and which references all plants, as well as schemes and water quality information.  Moreover, wastewater plants have been the subject of licence applications which provide a lot of detail on the plants and in general on where they are short in being able to meet either capacity or compliance standards.<\/p><p>  Consequently, with a little maturity and additional surveys and work, we will end up with a national database of all the assets.  We will have standard policies and specifications and standards for all equipment across these assets.  We will have the capacity and the customer service that we can deliver throughout the system.  From all of this, we will be able to calculate the risk of not being able to comply with service needs.  Fundamentally, that is what will drive investment.  It will be tailored at a target risk of compliance or service provision that should be consistent across all customers.  Consequently, it should not matter whether one lives in a city or a rural area.  If the system is working well and one is investing properly and targeting capital maintenance, in particular, one will have an equivalent result and over time bring that standard up to where it needs to be.  <\/p><p>  Perhaps one of the biggest gaps in the water services area has been the lack of planned proactive investment in maintenance.  This is part of the reason we end up with assets in some places that are not fit for purpose.  Essentially - this is particularly true of the high growth period from approximately 1990 - all investment had to be in two areas.  The first was chasing capacity because we needed additional capacity, while the second was dealing with compliance with European standards.  As a result, almost nothing went back into the older assets which were deteriorating behind our backs.<\/p><p>  This is the basic model against which one plans the work one seeks to do.  One can then introduce measures such as spending to save, for example.  There is considerable potential for us to reduce operating costs by putting in new equipment to reduce energy costs, chemical usage or sludge production, as well as repairs.  One key outcome in any 12 month period should be considering where one is spending one's money on repair and maintenance work and ascertaining where one could replace a particular part of the asset base.  Even in respect of leakages, for example, a joined-up approach that involved more intensive find and fix measures in respect of items such as pressure management to reduce stress on the system would indicate to us - we will be mapping all of this activity - where we needed to go to replace pipes that would produce the biggest yield in reducing water losses.  This has allowed me to explain how the investment Mr. Barry described effectively will underpin the entire approach to operation and, in particular, maintenance of the asset base across the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100014#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1392135000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>To follow on from that reply, my understanding is we have inherited a completely<i> ad hoc<\/i> system that has poor data records and in which there is considerable inconsistency across the various networks, despite the fact that the local authorities were doing their best to keep the networks going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100014#Q01000","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392135600,"counter":345,"content":"<p>The total spend, which was mentioned earlier by the Deputy, was in the region of &euro;40 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100015#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1392135600,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Does that compare well with other jurisdictions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100015#R00300","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392135600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>That is inclusive of the customer system.

During the years many smaller towns and villages failed to come up with their polluter pays contribution because the local authority did not have the money when that system was introduced.  They are undeveloped, so to speak; therefore, it makes the case for doing something about the current position.  In my area there are 30 applications to the EPA for discharge licences, but only 15 have been issued.  The other 15 have been pending for quite some time because works are required.  That gives weight to the idea that we need an organisation such as Uisce &Eacute;ireann to fix things.  However, I am unclear on at what point it will state a sewage treatment plant in a certain area is not commercially viable, will not provide a return on investment and that it is over to the Department.  I understand group water schemes come under the heading of rural water, but where will Uisce &Eacute;ireann draw the line in the case of villages?<\/p><p>  I am familiar with some areas which need upgraded wastewater treatment plants but which are in SACs or NHAs.  Will these areas be given equal priority?  Parts of rural Ireland are heavily designated environmentally.  Shellfish are designated off some coastlines where the local authority is responsible for water quality.  If there is any diminution in that regard, they will be prosecuted.  Will this matter be given priority?

Scotland has been mentioned, but it has approximately 254 wastewater schemes, while we have well over 1,000.  On the water supply side of things, the position is similar.  Part of the cost challenge is the fact that we have such a dispersed population and so many smaller schemes.  The objective of Irish Water is to apply, as near as we can, consistency of approach and standards for customers, as well as targeting investment on the basis of need to meet service standards.  Many of the smaller schemes would benefit from an approach Irish Water favours, to have frameworks of contractors that can deliver standard unit solutions for small communities, in respect of which there is good potential.  One could deliver ten, 15 or 20 similar typical plants across communities of an appropriate size, while getting good value for money and achieving savings.  We have considerable ideas in that regard.  Equally, we must examine sustainable solutions concerning reed-bed technology.

There has been a boil notice on a continuous basis in Roscommon.  Does the delegation not accept that it would be very difficult to start people off on a metering system where they are told they will get a rebate rather than a reduction or no charge?  I think it would be no charge.  Could the delegation address that issue because it is very significant?

Could the delegation tell us what the CER's starting point in this is so we have some idea of where it is coming from?  Does the CER envisage a suite of charges?  The issue was outlined by Deputy Coffey.  What happens in my area where one has water in but no water out or where one has no water in but water out?  Will there be different levels or categories or charges?

Over the coming five or six years we will have to meet ongoing needs for water in Dublin.  We are aware of how tight capacity is at present and we are seeking to maximise the output of the Liffey plants at Leixlip and Ballymore Eustace.  This means finishing out our current investment in Leixlip and making further investments in Ballymore Eustace and in pipelines to transport the water to where we need it.  That will generate additional water, which will help us.  It is even more critical that we get to grips with leakage to a greater degree.  This will require a regional approach to develop leakage management capacity, leakage zone priorities, intensive find-and-fix repairs, automation of pressure management and replacement of mains.  Based on information gathered through the metering project, we hope to target customer-side losses.  The evidence of metering thus far indicates that 5% to 6% of households use considerably more water than normal usage patterns would suggest.  All of these measures will help us to stay ahead of demand and we have a fair idea of the demand load we will be facing over the next five or six years.<\/p><p>  During that period we will be working on the major source of water for Dublin.  This involves a statutory process which is currently ongoing.  We have a team working on the process.  It involves an environmental impact assessment stage which must evaluate all options objectively on the basis of environmental, technical and economic criteria.  The final outcome of that assessment will be delivered later this year as a preferred scheme, which will be developed further with a view to going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la before the end of 2015.  We have assumed that the oral hearings and decision making with An Bord Plean&aacute;la will last through 2016 and, assuming we can anticipate a successful outcome, we will be in the design and procurement phase in 2017 and early 2018, with a view to delivering water to Dublin towards the end of 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100020#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1392138600,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Could I get further clarity on the project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100020#W00400","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1392138600,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Does the Senator want written confirmation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100020#W00500","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1392138600,"counter":439,"content":"<p>No; I just want to ask a question.

First, on quality, the point I made earlier was it would seem sensible that if customers are not receiving a complete service they would not then be expected to pay the complete charge.  However, we have yet to consult on the details of how that actually will pan out in reality.  Consequently, I am unable to give the Senator a clear yes-or-no statement <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> charges.  I can state that we will consult on what are the acceptable limits with regard to quality, as it applies to the water that is delivered and the wastewater service that is achieved.  We also will consult on what will be the ramifications for water charges once such limits are not met.  All of this has yet to be decided and we will engage in consultations on it.<\/p><p>  On what best international practice actually means, it is a fairly complex area but ultimately, costs vary significantly from country to country depending on various issues such as demographics and population densities and so on.  For example, across Europe right now, a typical customer in Denmark spends &euro;670 per year on water charges, whereas in Scotland the equivalent figure is approximately &euro;390 per year.  However, these amounts hide the consumption level per customer, what level of investment has been carried out or whether there has been any catch-up in the various countries concerned.  Consequently, many factors must be taken into consideration, and so we look for the nearest comparators we can find.  We will consider countries such as Scotland as well as possibly considering regional water authorities in England and Wales that may have a similar distribution of population density and demographics.  Ultimately, however, there will not be an exact match and, as a result, we will take the best available information we have on both the establishment of utilities and their operation.  We will take and use that information to assess whether we think the costs Uisce &Eacute;ireann has incurred are reasonable, whether they benchmark well or whether they are excessive.  It is only after having carried out such analysis that we can then form a judgment and therefore decide whether to allow that cost, or what level of cost should be allowed.<\/p><p>  As for the suite of charges, I again must preface this by stating that no decisions have been made and all of this will be subject to consultation.  To revert to a previous question from a member on the water-in water-out principle, it probably is worth noting that we know from other countries that the amount of water that actually is consumed for drinking purposes is low; I believe it is between 5% and 10%.  Generally speaking, there is a high correlation between the amount of water that enters a property and the amount that leaves through wastewater.  However, that is one of the factors we would take into account.  As a minimum, we will have at least two charges.  One will be a meter charge and one will be an assessed, non-metered charge.  However, in our consultations, we will set out whether there are various options for metered charges, such as a fixed charge element and a variable charge element.  On the assessed charge, we may consider different factors that might be taken into account before one's charge is determined, such as occupancy levels, house size or whatever.  However, we have yet to determine that, and it all will be subject to public consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100021#X02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1392139200,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses from Irish Water and the CER for their attendance.  Mr. McGowan mentioned earlier that the Minister could issue instructions to the CER in respect of Irish Water.  Would that be usual in terms of ministerial responsibilities?  My second question pertains to the European Union's Water Framework Directive and Ireland's responsibilities regarding the quality of its water and its effluent management.  What is the current position in respect of Ireland's water standards?  Could Ireland potentially be subjected to European Union fines and, if so, how much might we be fined if we do not get our act together?<\/p><p>  I have a further question on the procurement rules for those who tender for contracts to do some work for Irish Water, such as the water maintenance and support work that would have been carried out on behalf of the local authorities in the past.  Media reports in my constituency have stated that a company that was supplying this type of work to Offaly County Council did not obtain a contract.  What is the position with regard to procurement?  Clearly, one does not seek job losses as a result of changes that are being made.<\/p><p>  On personal water consumption and people's individual responsibilities to reduce the amount of water they are using, I note that Ireland's consumption rate, at 150 litres per day, is among the highest, if not the highest, in Europe.

We carried out a number of competitions to put people onto different framework contracts, such as the one mentioned by the Deputy, as well as others pertaining to chemicals, repair and maintenance and CCTV and sewer jetting.  People submitted their applications to go on those frameworks and if one takes the totality of those companies which were invited and the numbers of tenders received, we had a success rate of approximately 80%.  However, on the point mentioned by the Deputy, we received communications back from the existing supply base to the effect that they could not get on or whatever.  We found in the first instance that it was very difficult to contact some of the suppliers and, second, when we put them through the assessment they were failing on some health and safety regulations.  Bearing that in mind, we put in place a particular health and safety specialist to assist them with their documentation to get them onto the frameworks.  Thereafter, we wrote to the local authorities stating that if an entity had a contract with the local authority, either formal or informal, we would honour that contract if we could see the paperwork or if we received verbal notification from the local authority that it existed.  We stated that as long as a supplier passed the minimum health and safety requirements, we were happy to allow that supplier to continue to do business with the local authority, which could then draw down that service as required.  This has proved to be quite successful, but ultimately we seek to reach a point at which we have a competitive supply base with frameworks in place from which Irish Water and the local authorities can draw down for the services they require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100021#X02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392139800,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Deputy Corcoran Kennedy asked two questions about the water framework directive and rainwater harvesting.

However, it has brought out a blueprint for implementation precisely because many countries, like Ireland, are struggling to achieve compliance.  In 2009, we adopted a river basin management plan for the period to 2009-2015 to be followed by other plans.  Within the plan, we had considerable ambitions around water quality achievement and much of that has not happened because of the lack of funding and the fact that we have not been able to keep up with the programme.  We are in some difficulty and a letter of formal notice issued to Ireland, which will result in fines without any action from our side.  However, the Department has responded to Brussels and we have worked with the Department to put together a response to that along the lines of setting out a commitment we will make in terms of what is achievable and reasonable.  This means making choices around schemes and discharges that will deliver the maximum benefit to the environment in the short term within what we can afford.  Clearly, there will be an element of toing and froing on this but, hopefully, we will arrive at a position, although I cannot predict this, where we will have an agreed plan, which Europe can live with and accept and which will represent our best endeavour to meet compliance.  It is certainly a significant risk for the country at the moment and the key to it will be that we set out a plan that we intend to deliver and then deliver it and live up to it.<\/p><p>  There is a second piece to that around how we engage in the drawing up of future river basin management plans because there is a new plan to be developed up to 2021.   It is important that we have all the objective information on catchment water quality to put the right measures into that plan rather than setting standards that are unnecessarily high.  Clearly, we have the objective of good water quality but it has to be conditioned on what is proportionate, what is the cost of compliance with a particular standard and what standard will be required to meet the objective.  Irish Water can bring a lot more information, evidence and technical engagement with the EPA to that discussion and that will be valuable in saving costs that would not deliver the benefit.<\/p><p>  There is a good deal of discussion around rainwater harvesting and clearly it has some potential and it can be incentivised both by grants and the opportunity to reduce costs for water.  The difficulty is that it is probably only practical on the basis of incorporation into new builds because it would cost a lot to retrofit such a system in existing housing stock and, therefore, the take-up of rainwater harvesting is likely to be relatively slow and likely to make a relatively small impact.  However, I would like to confirm that we have engaged with schools and are getting involved in a schools information programme, which is important.  We will also have a great deal of other information coming through in terms of water conservation in the home, tips on best practice and so on.  The Deputy is correct that in the context of bringing in charges, we hope to get a dividend of at least a 10% reduction in household water usage and that will make an important contribution to meeting requirements and will allow us to defer investment we would otherwise require in the coming five of six years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100022#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392139800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>With regard to the Deputy's question about ministerial directions, it is not unusual to have that provision.

Not only can people not drink it but they have to stand over their children to make sure they use bottled water when they brush their teeth.  The children in my town, Castlerea, regularly have stomach aches way in excess of what to me was the norm years ago because try as one might, children will run for the tap.  We live in fear that they will go near the product Irish Water is delivering to our houses.  Reference was made to the company putting infrastructure and systems in place.  The same structure will be in place and there will be an umbrella over it called Irish Water.  That was obvious in the past while but it became even more obvious when Councillor John Murphy from Castlerea contacted the company about the water supply.  He received a letter stating Irish Water took \"responsibility for water services on 1 January 2014.  As the agents of Irish Water, the local authorities will continue to operate the Castlerea schemes on our behalf as well as working with Irish Water to resolve the problem\".  If we end up with the same system to monitor water, how will that solve our problem?<\/p><p>  I do not know if the officials are aware of this but I imagine they are.  If not, it is terrifying to think that they have missed it.  When people see polluted water, they are meant to go the EPA.  When I contacted the agency, it instructed Roscommon County Council to investigate the problem.  Irish Water says the council will continue to operate the Castlerea schemes.  Where are our assurances that the water quality will improve?  If one reports a problem, the council will get to investigate itself.  What will change in the system?<\/p><p>  It is bad enough that when one goes to the EPA, the agency then goes back to the local authority but I am sure the officials are aware of the pollution An Taisce has highlighted over the past week in a so-called SAC lake in Glenamaddy, County Galway.  Raw sewage was being pumped into the lake.  The EPA is aware of this and it was known by the agency as far as back as June 1997.  The An Taisce report referred to Galway County Council's attempt to consider alternative sewage disposal options for several years but almost five years since the application, the problem remains and the EPA is yet to make a decision.  Irish Water is the umbrella group for this disaster and the company will supposedly deliver drinking water to us.  How is this possible?  The officials talked about the system changing but it will not.  The company will continue to work with local authorities.  The public made the State's agencies well aware that raw sewage was being dumped in a lake in Glenamaddy.  Members of the local turf cutting committee stood in front of Mr. Justice Quirke, a former High Court judge, and informed him that this was going on but nothing happened.  What magic will the officials employ to change that?<\/p><p>  The urban water in my town scheme is the subject of a boil water notice now as well as the rural water scheme.

However, in situations of high run-off in winter conditions, they are prone to bacterial and microbiological infection.  The necessary barriers were not put in when the schemes were installed and therefore they are wide open in that situation.<\/p><p>  In a general sense Irish Water is absolutely committed to what are known as water safety plans for every water scheme in the country.  Water safety plans start with the source and finish at the tap.  That means policing the sources in order to minimise the risk of degradation of drinking water, then providing a minimum level of barrier within the treatment or production part of the cycle and then following it through in distribution so that the reservoirs, pipelines and so on do not allow for recontamination.<\/p><p>  I fully acknowledge that a number of schemes are on the books and ready to be started by Roscommon County Council.  These are proceeding and obviously the Boyle scheme is well in hand.  The Kileglin plant is also about to start or has started on site.  We are absolutely committed to getting people who are on current boil notices off them in the shortest possible time.  We will do that by putting in appropriate treatment.

That is particularly true in a county such as Roscommon, which did not have much sophisticated treatment for the reason I mentioned - originally those water sources did not require much treatment and therefore there was no tradition of providing treatment.

The treatment requirements are not the same from scheme to scheme.  Ultraviolet radiation can work in some cases but in others we need coagulation filtration.  We need to know what the answer is and will then set about doing it.  If we can put in place a temporary skid mounted plant, we will do so, but even this takes a certain length of time.  One must investigate and solve the problem and go through a procurement process, build the plant, get it to the site and undertake the ground works.

In its evidence today the regulator stated the new charging regime would not be agreed to before August and that it would be a number of years before issues regarding commercial users would be resolved.  In the interim, as a measure of good faith, will Irish Water ensure commercial users of water who are charged for water which is unsafe to drink will have these charges removed?  We are speaking about a relatively small number of commercial users such as restaurants, bars and food and drink suppliers in the affected areas.  Will Irish Water give an assurance that commercial users will not be charged for water where they spend a huge amount of money on replacement ice and water supplies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100024#AA01300","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392141000,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I am not in a position to give the Deputy that commitment today, but I will take it away and come back to him with a full response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021100024#AA01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Tierney"},{"type":"speech","time":1392141000,"counter":534,"content":"<p>Fair enough.  My next question is for Irish Water and the regulator.  When the roll-out of meters is complete, approximately 30% of households in the country will not have a water meter.  These are houses in rural areas, apartments and houses in urban areas with multiple connections to the same water supply.  How will water and user charges be calculated in these cases?  It is unfair for people to be charged based on usage in some areas, while people in other areas are penalised because of geographical location.  How is it intended to address this issue?<\/p><p>  Mr. McGowan has stated costs and charges will be benchmarked against best international practice.  What is the international practice in charging for water which is unfit for human consumption?  Are people charged for it?  It is a simple question to which people want to know the answer.  Will they be charged for water which is unsafe to drink?  What is the position where the supply is inadequate?  Deputy Paudie Coffey mentioned water pressure which is not suitable for showers, washing machines and dishwashers.

I would like a definitive answer on the issue of water in and water out, or pay as one flushes, which is what it seems will be introduced.  In this room 12 months ago I questioned the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, on this specific issue.  He stated people would not be charged for flushing toilets or water out.  I specifically raised the issue on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 19 December and the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, interrupted me to state the water out provision would apply only to commercial premises.  The evidence we have heard today from the regulator is that there will be a charge for water out; therefore, a flushing tax will be introduced as part of the water charges to be levied.  I want a definitive \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer.  I can see the merits, but there are conflicting messages from the Minister, Government policy and the regulator.

International experience tends to show that the bulk of the water entering a property exits it through a wastewater treatment service if there happens to be one.  The charging system should reflect this.  If, for example, the cost is split 50:50, there would be an identifiable charge for water in and another for water out.  How this is presented in a bill is yet to be determined, but it stands to reason that we must determine a water in charge and a water out charge in order to put a fair system of charging in place for all customers.

It is the only national umbrella dedicated to representing issues affecting this population, which is estimated to be more than 700,000 people in Ireland.  The Neurological Alliance of Ireland has played a significant role in developing the policy agenda for neurological health services in this country.  It represents the interests of patients and patient organisations on a wide range of fora.<\/p><p>  There are a number of characteristics of neurological care in Ireland.  They include long waiting lists for access to neuro-specialists, including for diagnosis.  In addition, multidisciplinary care is hampered by extremely stretched and under-resourced teams, where they exist, as in some neurology centres there is little access to multidisciplinary support.  Moreover, community aftercare and rehabilitation is extremely under-resourced and underdeveloped.  There is only one specialised neuro-rehabilitation community team established in Ireland, working in the mid-west region.  All these characteristics combine to result in access to neurological care that falls far below what should be expected in a developed country.  There is a largely disjointed and unco-ordinated approach in this country for those who require neurological care and neuro-rehabilitation.  Individuals and families require services on a continuum basis, due to the nature and often the complexity of the neurological conditions with which they are living.  The current service delivery model is largely episodic, almost exclusively medical in nature and does not reflect or meet the real needs.  This is costly and ineffective, not good practice and incredibly frustrating for patients and families.<\/p><p>  Our presentation today concentrates on community aftercare and neuro-rehabilitation.  Access to neuro-rehabilitation services was highlighted in a case reported on just two weeks ago in the health supplement of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, in which a victim of traumatic brain injury was informed there was a four-month waiting list for one of three high-dependency beds in the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH.  The then clinical lead of the national rehabilitation medicine programme made the following statement in an interview with the<i> Irish Medical Times<\/i> in 2011:<blockquote>There are insufficient numbers of rehabilitation medicine consultants, insufficient access to specialist rehabilitation at a local level, lack of support for primary care teams in managing very challenging cases and lack of support for the patient and their families.  Even if a patient has been through the services of the NRH, once they get discharged they&rsquo;re very often left in a kind of limbo.<\/blockquote>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland carried out a national survey in 2013 asking patients and family members about their access to neuro-rehabilitation services.  The results highlighted the critical issue of access to therapies in the community as 40% could not access neuropsychology services and 25% could not access physiotherapy or occupational therapy services to meet their needs.<\/p><p>  It is difficult to propose comprehensive solutions to the complex and wide-ranging challenges affecting neurological care in Ireland in the scope of this brief presentation.  However, it is clear that steps must be taken to address the critical lack of aftercare services for people after diagnosis or onset of a neurological condition.  There are salient points which can be made in this regard this evening.  First, Ireland could address a critical issue in respect of neuro-rehabilitation by putting in place the community neuro-rehabilitation teams recommended in the national neuro-rehabilitation strategy published by the Government in 2011.  To date, there is only one such team in the mid-west.  The steady erosion of community-based therapy provision and the lack of new investment will significantly hamper the establishment of those teams.  Case management is essential for those with complex needs, such as people with acquired brain injury, to avoid the type of disjointed care experienced by these individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021100003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Magdalen Rogers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392139500,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Rogers.

I have been reflecting on how things have changed since my first submission over a decade ago.  At that time the main problem that we had was that there was a severe shortage of neurologists.  I am pleased to say that we have had a substantial increase in the number of consultants since that time &ndash; our numbers have increased from 11 when I was first appointed in 1996 to 34 currently in post.  We have also had in improvement in the distribution of neurologists.  There was a major problem when I started but there is now a service in all regions of the country, albeit still limited in some areas, such as the north west.  However, as we came from a very low base, the increase in the number of neurologist from 11 to 34 has uncovered a huge unmet need within the community.  It must also be noted that our understanding of the brain has also improved considerably in the past decade, and that we now have new treatments for many conditions - ultiple sclerosis and stroke come to mind - that can have a spectacular impact on the course of illness, and both quality of life and survival for those affected.  That has of course had a big impact on the type of work that neurologists do.  Our role in previous generations might have been to provide accurate diagnoses - the term was \"diagnose and adios\" - but we are now integral members of multidisciplinary teams that provide long-term care and life-sustaining treatments for patients.<\/p><p>  In the context of how we are doing with regard to the number of neurologists we have improved but there is still scope for considerable expansion.  To provide a truly responsive service, we would need to build both on the numbers of neurologists, and in particular in the numbers of neurologists with an interest in stroke, but perhaps more important, we need to build effective, highly professional multidisciplinary teams including other professionals such as nurses, psychologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, dieticians, social workers and many other professionals that make up the team.<\/p><p>  That brings me to the main thrust of what I would like to address today.  There are really two main points that I would like to make that I think members, as our elected representatives, can address on our behalf.  The two points are linked but I will discuss them separately.  The first is about consistency and accountability within the HSE, and the very poor communication and delays in decision making that we all encounter.  I have attached for the information of committee members extracts from a transcript provided to me by one of my patients.  Some of the details have been changed slightly to preserve anonymity, but I can assure members of their authenticity.  I will not read it out but it is available.  The person concerned, and many others in a similar situation, was trying to establish the status of their medical card.  I am sorry to say that their interaction with the HSE would be better placed in a script from &ldquo;Irish Pictorial Weekly&rdquo;, or \"Little Britain\" rather than real life.  It is truly horrifying and I am sorry to say that it is not unique.  The extract probably encapsulates how we treat our fellow citizens in a far more effective way than anything I can say to the committee.<\/p><p>  We are told that people are provided with medical cards on the basis of a means test, but that some people with severe and progressive illness can apply for medical cards on discretionary grounds on the basis of hardship.  We are told that the HSE, on the instruction of the Department of Health, interprets &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; in a narrow financial context.  We are told that such discretionary applications are reviewed by a medical board, and that a formula is used to determine whether the likely hardship encountered by the patient meets a certain threshold that would qualify for a discretionary card.  We are also told that the eligibility is subject to review and re-review.  We would like to know how this formula works.  We would like to see exactly how financial hardship is measured, exactly what formula is used and how it is applied.  We would also like to know why some people with clear evidence of progressive neurological disability, supported by many letters and other documentary evidence, are regularly subjected to review of their eligibility, sometimes as frequently as at six-month intervals.  We would like to see how the system works because it should be transparent, reproducible, and open to scrutiny.  We would like to be able to then challenge the decisions with our own models, based on sound health economic analysis, that show that it is actually more cost effective to give people with progressive and disabling neurological conditions access to community services free of charge, than to make them pay for inferior poorly co-ordinated services in the private sector, and by doing so drive them back into the hospital system.<\/p><p>  The second point is about joined-up thinking.  I and my colleagues such as Dr. Colin Doherty work in major teaching hospitals.  These are subjected to HSE-driven targets.  That is understandable because we have long waiting lists for some specialties including neurology.  Reducing waiting lists is very important.  Nobody should have to wait for nine to 12 months for a specialist opinion.  Part of the problem is that the number of available neurologists, and other professionals such as nurse specialists, is still lower than it should be for the size and expectations, which are increasing, of our population.<\/p><p>  We also have some concerns in how we are currently asked to reduce our waiting lists because we believe that it is damaging our ability to take care of people with neurological illness.  The HSE has asked us to prioritise new patients and to reduce the numbers of patients returning to our clinics but at the same time we are under greater pressure to follow return patients as their disease progresses, particularly those on expensive drugs that require surveillance such as MS.  Indeed, we are now required to reissue hi-tech prescriptions every six months.  How can we do that if we are not allowed to review patients receiving the drugs?  How can we discharge people to community-based services that do not exist, and even if they do, that they cannot access because they have been denied a medical card?  I do not need to remind members that cut-backs in health are biting really hard.  As Ms Rogers mentioned, many primary care teams exist only on paper, and essential posts are vacant for months on end.  The maximum number of hours available within the community for essential services to those with disabilities has been radically cut back.  For many patients attending the neurology clinics in our hospitals is the only way by which they can continue to access any sort of service that is relevant to their needs.<\/p><p>  As for what we would like members as our elected representatives to do about the situation, first, I and my colleagues would like the committee to recognize that the one-size-fits-all model that the HSE applies does not work in neurology.  Our role in continuing to care for people with chronic neurological disease must be valued.  In neurology, the returning patient must be recognised as equally important as the new patient in the HSE metric.<\/p><p>  Of course, we need to reduce waiting lists, but the policy of excessive prioritisation of new patients over return patients, as required by the HSE, is bad for our fellow citizens.  We recognise that our models of care must change and they are changing.  Some of the shortages in neurologists could be addressed by building capacity in collaboration with other professional groups.  We have had some major successes in this regard, as evidenced by the epilepsy programme where the model of care includes highly trained nurse practitioners with extensive clinical expertise.  Dr. Doherty will speak about the experience in that regard.  However, for us to provide a responsive, cost effective and valuable service, we need joined-up thinking with a strong emphasis on accountability within the HSE.  I refer to simple accountability such as accountability on how medical cards are delivered.<\/p><p>  We must remember that there is a continued role for specialist clinics in hospitals, while at the same time we must strive to build really effective multidisciplinary neurorehabilitative services, as outlined by Ms Rogers, that are both patient-friendly and that link expertise within the hospitals with high-functioning neurorehabilitative service within the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021100004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Orla Hardiman"},{"type":"speech","time":1392139500,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Hardiman for attending today's meeting.

Subarachnoid Haemorrhage, SAH, is an immediate and life-threatening emergency.  An estimated 460 to 1290 people suffer a brain haemorrhage each year.  Ten to 15 per cent of casualties die before reaching hospital and about half of all patients die within the six months.  Guidelines for the management of SAH patients were introduced by HIQA in 2010 to clarify the criteria for admitting patients for emergency neurosurgical or endovascular treatment but these guidelines have not improved access to treatment, nor could they.  The reality is that the neurosurgical centre is grossly under-resourced.  There are just ten neurosurgical intensive care beds.  A report entitled &quot;Towards Excellence in Critical Care&quot; by an expert group on critical care services in the Republic of Ireland was presented to the HSE in 2009.  That report assessed a need for 52 intensive care and eight high dependency neurosurgical beds.<\/p><p>  I advised HIQA in 2008 that standards and measures of performance were required to address the inconsistency of decisions being made in the neurosurgical centre to admit SAH patients for treatment.  No action was taken by HIQA until after the authority had been challenged in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> in September 2009.  The measures of performance or key performance indicators, KPIs which HIQA introduced were customised to satisfy the constraints of inadequate resources.  Consequently, they restrict access to treatment and are unsafe.

There is no clear separation of roles and responsibilities for patient safety between the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, the investigating authority, and the Health Service Executive, HSE, which funds health care.  In 2012, out of 238 SAH, subarachnoid haemorrhage, patients who were diagnosed, 138 were treated but 100 were denied treatment.  There is no information on the outcome for these patients.  If poor grade patients were to be admitted to the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, 53% could expect a good recovery.<\/p><p>  We need to know the outcome for SAH patients who were denied neurosurgical treatment between 2011 and 2013.  This information is available in Beaumont Hospital because the neurosurgical centre is required to provide a patient management plan for each SAH patient referred for treatment.  Letters are sent from the centre to each referring hospital, so the records are in place.  There is a culture of secrecy and denial, however.  The statement by Beaumont Hospital to <i>The Irish Times<\/i> that appropriate protocols were in place to ensure SAH patients receive emergency neurosurgical treatment was misleading.  HIQA claims the HSE is responsible for the safety of patients who require treatment.  However, the HSE relies on assurances from Beaumont Hospital that the neurosurgical centre can provide access to treatment but assurances from Beaumont Hospital are not reliable.<\/p><p>  My written submission makes 13 recommendations which I urge the joint committee to carefully consider, approve and recommend for action to the Minister for Health.  I particularly recommend an increase in the number of neurosurgical intensive care beds in line with the recommendations from Towards Excellence in Critical Care and review the corporate and clinical governance standards at HIQA and the HSE.  I also recommend the urgent review of mortality and morbidity for SAH patients denied treatment between 2011 and 2013.  One small change, which would not incur any costs, relates to the interhospital transfer of critically ill patients.  This should have the same urgency as a 999 emergency call.  There was one case where it took three and a half hours to transfer a patient from one hospital to another.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021100006#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Lawless"},{"type":"speech","time":1392140700,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lawless for his presentation.

Professor Orla Hardiman made the point about a largely disjointed non-co-ordinated approach which is costly and ineffective.  Reference was also made to the recruitment embargo in the public sector putting pressure on therapy services.  This is a policy that the committee has not overlooked.  We need to get the message through that it cannot continue because it is having serious detrimental impacts on treatment programmes and outcomes.<\/p><p>  I have previously highlighted the inadequacies of neurorehabilitation services with the Minister for Health at the committee&rsquo;s July quarterly ministerial meeting.  The response I received was wholly inadequate and was deeply disappointing.  I commend the launch of the alliance&rsquo;s neurorehabilitation manifesto last year and hope it continues to have good luck in all it undertakes.  Its latest survey on the numbers suffering neurological conditions demonstrates a point the committee has addressed repeatedly, namely 27% of them have had medical cards refused or withdrawn.  This is further evidence of a point we have argued consistently with the Minister and the HSE executive at this committee.  In fairness, it is not just Opposition Members on the committee who have raised this matter.  We are all universally angered by this fact and have asked for changes to the policy.<\/p><p>  I thank Professor Hardiman for providing us with a transcript of the telephone conversation between a patient and the medical card centre.

I have a number of very focused questions.  In common with most parts of the health service, neurological services such as neurosurgery, neurorehabilitation and neuropathology, are grotesquely understaffed by any international comparison.  I will ask some specific questions on that.  I do not want anybody to think that any part of me is criticising my professional colleagues or colleagues from other professions.  They do extraordinary and heroic jobs under very difficult circumstances in which they have been placed by successive Governments and by the permanent government, which has historically had a very unrealistic view of how a health service should work.  This view is coloured virtually entirely through the prism of Her Majesty's National Health Service which, for all its glory, is by modern, western standards, not the standard we should emulate.<\/p><p>  I would like to address some questions primarily to Dr. Doherty and Professor Hardiman and they will probably need to get their pens out.  How many neurologists, neurosurgeons and neurorehabilitation consultants are there per head of population in Ireland?  What is recommended by the local professional authorities?  What would the numbers be, in so far as they know, for the UK, continental Europe and North America?<\/p><p>  Like Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I have mentioned neurorehabilitation in other fora over the last year, specifically regarding D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which I mentioned in the Seanad last year.  Compared to other countries, Ireland has approximately 60% to 70% of the number of neurorehabilitation personnel per head of population that would be found in the UK.  We have one fifth of the numbers that would be found in general in continental Europe.  The number of beds we have per head of population is 10% of that which is available in France.  That is just one example.  I strongly suspect that for all the other disciplines our numbers are similarly low.<\/p><p>  Speaking from the perspective of my day job, I have always been troubled by the adequacy of neurosurgical services in Ireland.  This is not because I have any problem with the quality, competence, dedication and diligence of the people who work on the front line in Beaumont, Cork and other units but because they are grotesquely under-provided and it has always been my impression that as a result of this a series of Band Aids has been put over an inadequate service.  Let the witnesses correct me if I am wrong.  Is it appropriate that ambulances in Dublin can take somebody potentially with head trauma to a hospital were neurosurgery may not be available?<\/p><p>  In Dublin neurosurgery is available in only one hospital.  Most of the acute hospitals which are on call for neurosurgical trauma and sudden catastrophic neurosurgical events such as brain haemorrhages will not have the expertise on campus.  This means, by definition, that in five out of six hospitals to which patients will be brought, if they have such a problem which requires that backup, there is a built-in delay and <i>triage<\/i> of having people at a remote site trying to deal with a problem telemetrically by assessing scans that have been forwarded over.  If one of my precious family members had a neurosurgical catastrophe, I know the kind of service I would like them to have and the kind of service they would have.  I do not believe this is the service that is routinely available to people who dial 999 and are brought to hospital in an ambulance.  We need to seriously look at that situation.<\/p><p>  I met Mr. Lawless and he is obviously somebody about whom it will be said that he is bearing a personal grudge or acting as a crank.  I will not speak about the specifics of what happened in Beaumont Hospital.  However, the general perception that somebody could examine how a person with neurosurgical potential catastrophe in Ireland is dealt with and find the situation to be wholly inadequate is very plausible.  I am sorry about that.  I am not pointing fingers at individual people or units, but we do not do this very well.  One of the reasons this meeting is happening today is because I suggested it, and one of the reasons I suggested it is because I met Mr. Lawless.  Mr. Lawless was, to an extent, singing from a hymn sheet from which I had been warbling a few bars to myself over the years.<\/p><p>  I am a little troubled by this.  Identifiable individuals have a right to their reputations.  Publicly funded bodies do not, be it St. Vincent's University Hospital or the board of that hospital, Beaumont Hospital, HIQA, the HSE, the Department of Health or any other entity.  Recently we had the absurd situation where a respected medical journalist, Dr. Ruair&iacute; Hanley, wrote a piece about the problems with medical cards and got a threatening letter sent by a PR spokesperson for the HSE.  The HSE should have no PR spokespersons.  Public servants should speak for themselves on their own track records.  They should not spend taxpayers' money to hire people whose primary purpose is not to foster communications but to defend their reputation.  It has a chilling effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021100007#H01000","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1392141300,"counter":606,"content":"<p>To be fair, the persons about whom Senator Crown is speaking are not here to defend themselves.

Can one imagine if somebody was prevented from criticising the FDA, the National Institutes of Health or the Pentagon in Washington because somebody there stated he or she would threaten to sue if the reputation of the organisation was questioned?  We would have no investigative journalism whatsoever if that happened.  For these reasons I must state I find myself very much in sympathy with the tenor of Mr. Lawless's comments.

It is a difficult question.  In Ireland we have approximately one neurologist per 117,000 people.  Dr. Doherty did a quick calculation and in the UK there is approximately one per 80,000 people.  The difficulty with the question on what is the remit of neurology is the remit is quite wide.  The biggest neurological problem we have is stroke, which falls somewhat in the remit of neurology and somewhat in the remit of medicine for the elderly.  If stroke is included as part of the remit of neurology we are grossly underresourced and undersupported.  To have one per 100,000 people we should have 45 neurologists and to have one per 80,000 people, which would be equivalent to the UK, we should have 54.  We would need another group of specialists with expertise in stroke and it should include neurological support.<\/p><p>  Dr. Doherty will probably develop the point that a neurologist in isolation is not a particularly helpful animal.  We are pretty good at making diagnoses but to implement the best care we would like to have for ourselves and our families we should be part of a team, which brings us to the employment embargo which is a huge problem.  The model by which we deliver care should change to a multidisciplinary form whereby we are part of a multidisciplinary team.  We would need another ten or 20 neurologists to make the team work, but it would not work without the other disciplines.  Dr. Doherty has described a very good model on the important role highly-trained clinical specialist nurses and nurse practitioners can play in the delivery of care.<\/p><p>  We have a tangible request to make of the committee with regard to medical cards, which is to investigate the formula used to define the difference between the means test for the medical card and the discretionary medical card.  We have been informed a financial mechanism or metric is used in the HSE with regard to the difference when somebody exceeds the mean but falls into the discretionary category.  We would like to know the health economic basis of the metric.  It is a tangible question on which we would like the committee to come back to us because we would like to test it with our own health economic analysis.

With regard to managed primary care and how it will be delivered and why it may not be very advanced, it goes back to what Professor Hardiman stated.  What patients seek, particularly when they are diagnosed with a chronic disease, is a pathway of care.  They do not just seek one specialist.  We know from chronic diseases unless we can use all of the resources the health services have to bear, including community services of which primary care doctors are leaders and engage them in delivering some of the care, we will be overwhelmed.  Academically everyone agrees with this.<\/p><p>  Our nurses are in place everywhere except the south.  They are available and willing to deliver care.  We are engaging with the primary care nurses with an e-learning programme to teach them how to deliver care.  We believe 70% of patients with epilepsy can be managed safely in the community.  Our real problem is a contractual issue.  It is not an issue of privilege and no one needs to be here to answer it.  A new contract is being negotiated which will, we hope, deliver a clear remit for primary care to deal with chronic disease.  At present it does not exist.  The letter of the existing contract does not state there is an absolute role to deliver chronic disease management.

I am wearing my management hat for the HSE, but to my right and left are people who are speaking in a very personal capacity.  Their points are well made.  I got involved in this because I think the most complex thing we do is deliver health care, and it must be delivered.  People are crying out for process and data.  When I started this programme we were a group of experts who were all providing care.  If a person in Galway had epilepsy, their chance of getting the same type of care as a person in Dublin was minimal.  It was all very different.  Now, we are starting to standardise everything we do.  I acknowledge the hurt of Mr. Lawless and the points he makes.  He is crying out for a process to be put in place for what happens to people.  That might be what HIQA meant to happen in 2010.  It is a question of whether we, as a profession of consultants, have delivered on that process.  That is where the concern lies.  If I talk about what I am delivering on a daily basis, I should point out that the people I work with on a daily basis are crying out for process.  Unless we put a process around it, it will not be fixed.<\/p><p>  With regard to neurosurgery, there are numbers, resourcing and bed issues.  However, one must put a process around this complex delivery of care.  For example, I do not believe that one cannot safely manage a patient who has some neurosurgical issues in a distant centre, but unless one gets the governance right and somebody takes responsibility at the neurosurgical centre for managing a patient who is in a distant centre, they will never be looked after properly.  There must be a set of trigger points for the movement of the patient.  The patient must be moved according to a set of protocols.  If the patient runs into A, B or C trouble, the ambulance service must deal with that as an emergency, like a 999 call.

I am disadvantaged in terms of knowledge of the subject but Professor Hardiman explained the issue very well in her final contribution.  The strong theme that ran through the presentations, not only by the four contributors but from all of us on this side of the House, was that we want a better service.<\/p><p>  As previous speakers have said, we can talk to the wall all day but nothing will happen if we cannot make sense of the questions raised.  However, that is not the fault of the witnesses because the HSE and HIQA have a responsibility in this matter.<\/p><p>  Apart from better service, all of us want accountability because it is a cardinal point.  If one does not have accountability then one does not have anything.  Taxpayers should not have to pay for a service that is devoid of a system of accountability and information on how it is carried out or performed.  With all due respect to the medical profession, doctors are not above the law and accountability which is the way it should be in a caring society.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in put the issue perfectly right and I agree with him.  I may not use the blunt language used by Mr. Lawless in his interesting contribution.  I read all of his informative contribution.  I have used worse language than Mr. Lawless used but I would not put it in print but he had the right to do so.  However, I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that the matter should be forwarded to the HSE.  The recommendations made by Mr. Lawless are flawless.  Perhaps they are flawed but I am not a medic.  He is perfectly correct that his recommendations should be sent to the HSE and that we should know all of the information. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021100010#L01700","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speech","time":1392143100,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for attending.
