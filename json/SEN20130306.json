We are honoured to have him here.<\/p><p>If it were not for the fact that it would eat into the important time for discussion of the property tax Bill, we would be proposing a vote on the Order of Business today.  The property tax is a serious issue and one that will have an impact on the lives and wallets of every household.  To guillotine this discussion in just three hours is fundamentally wrong.  I ask the Leader to reconsider and to make more time available to discuss the issue.  As we know, the tax is deeply unsettling for most of Ireland.  It will be extremely unfair for those in the larger cities such as Dublin, where people have collectively paid billions of euro in stamp duty over the years, to be penalised again in this way.  People who wish to defer the tax will be treated like criminals and tax defaulters and forced to pay a rate of interest that is linked specifically to tax defaulters.  The threshold at which one is entitled to defer is pitifully low and excludes most of the people throughout the country who have had mortgage difficulties.  <\/p><p>I acknowledge that the Leas-Chathaoirleach ruled out of order a proposed matter on the Adjournment.  I ask for an urgent debate on the NRA's proposed cuts to 80 projects throughout the country, which are to be suspended.  As Senator Comiskey rightly pointed out, some of those projects are more worthy than others, and some are critically important in view of the fatalities that have been caused over the years.  Yesterday, Senator Comiskey rightly mentioned the N4 in Sligo, a stretch of road described by a coroner as the most deadly road in Ireland and responsible for the loss of 30 lives in as many years.  That road project is now to be suspended.  Apparently, under the jobs initiative the Government will hand-pick some of the projects to go ahead, using criteria to be determined, for the creation of employment.  I hope priority is given to the seriousness of the difficulties that have been caused and the fatalities throughout the country, and that the road project to which I referred will be included, given the fact that the road is so dangerous.  I hope we will not take the approach of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, to selecting projects.  In that case, it was the proximity to his Cabinet colleagues that determined which projects went ahead.  Sligo County Council received a letter informing it that it could not proceed any further with the N4 project.  I understand that Mayo County Council did not receive a letter about the Castlebar to Westport stretch, but we all know who lives at either end of that particular road.  We will revisit the matter.  I hope that when the roads to be worked on are selected under the jobs initiative, the N4 is prioritised.  It has been described as the most dangerous road in the country.  Those are not my words but those of the coroner for the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600003#B00500","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1362565800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I also extend a welcome to Professor Huxley, who is in the Visitors' Gallery.<\/p><p>I call for a debate on legislation on assisted human reproduction following the two judgments on surrogacy by Mr. Justice Henry Abbott at the High Court yesterday.  We discussed them briefly on yesterday's Order of Business.  I wish to reiterate how important it is that we legislate in this area.  It is inappropriate that families and parents are forced to litigate in order to ensure that the rights of their children are recognised.  The judgments appear to be eminently sensible in the circumstances and in the best interests of the children concerned, of whom there were a number. <\/p><p>I note that the Government rapporteur, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, has also called for legislation to regulate the area and to ensure that parents and families are aware of their rights and responsibilities, and of their children's rights, in this regard.  I commend the former Senator, Mary Henry, who pioneered the matter in the Seanad previously.<\/p><p>I call for a debate on Traveller ethnicity.  There is growing momentum in support of legal recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  I note that the matter was the subject of the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme last night.  Deputy P\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn participated in the programme and I commend him on his moves to ensure there is cross-party support for recognition of Travellers' ethnicity.  I know that Deputy Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in has also been very active in this regard.  The Labour Party is happy to support the matter.

She was also critical of prison conditions.  I remind the House that the Oireachtas justice committee will publish, in the next week or so, a report on penal reform which will address prison conditions and overcrowding, among other things.

It has been brought to my attention that commercial interests are promoting the sale of gypsum products for use as animal bedding in slatted units and other holding facilities.  Gypsum, when washed into slurry pits, will break down in the anaerobic conditions in a pit over time, thus releasing the extremely toxic hydrogen sulfide gas.  The gas can be detected at low levels due to its smell of rotten eggs, and can thus be avoided; however, at higher levels it knocks out nasal sensors and will kill instantly.  We are all aware of the high-profile case of the Spence family in Northern Ireland who died due to the presence of hydrogen sulfide in a slurry pit.  I understand that the use of gypsum for the purpose of bedding is now banned in Northern Ireland and has been banned for that purpose in England and Scotland.  It is unbelievable that gypsum is sold in the Republic of Ireland without any warning of this danger.  To prevent further loss of life, I ask that the Leader bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

This scheme, which was introduced about 15 years ago, allows potential purchasers of council houses to buy the house in a scheme whereby they take out half a mortgage and pay rent for the other half of the house.  In most cases the first half of the mortgage is taken out over 30 years.  They pay rent for 30 years and then take out the second half of the mortgage over another 30 years.  This means that a person could be paying a mortgage for 60 years, and during that time they remain a tenant of the council.  I came across many people in the scheme during my time as a councillor.  I have never promoted the scheme or encouraged anybody to partake in it because effectively one is neither fish nor flesh when one is in the scheme.<\/p><p>I call on the Leader to bring this scheme to the attention of the Minister and to ask the Minister to review the scheme with a view to abandoning it as an option for people to buy houses.  The duration of the scheme is too long for people to become house owners.  It creates difficulties when people pass on to the next world in that if they have made a will, they are neither an owner nor a tenant, tenancy rights are questionable, and the ownership is certainly questionable.  The issue of mortgage protection arises also.  It is very difficult to get mortgage protection on half a house if someone tried to do it.  There is also the issue of people who are locked into this scheme and paying extremely high interest rates because the scheme was introduced about 15 years ago.  They are in very difficult circumstances.  I ask the Leader to speak to the Minister with responsibility for housing with a view to reviewing the full scheme, winding it up and entering into negotiations with the poor misfortunates around the country who were foolish enough, and encouraged in some quarters, to enter into this scheme, to give them an option to leave the scheme on a favourable rate to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600004#C00200","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1362566400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator MacSharry regarding the discussion on the family home tax, or property tax.  Three hours of debate is insufficient.  When the legislation to bring this tax into being was passed before Christmas, only three hours to debate it were provided.  It was guillotined.  One amendment was reached.  This is important legislation.  It is draconian in some ways in that it gives huge powers to Revenue and to the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Social Protection and the Environment, Community and Local Government to take money from people's grants, social welfare payments, wages and even their bank accounts.  In most cases, this tax will impact on families who, as we know, are already struggling to pay bills, put food on the table, put heating oil in the tanks, send their children to third and fourth level education, and primary and secondary school.  Many families simply do not have the money to give.<\/p><p>In recent months I have raised a number of independent reports on the political system which have shown that more people in this State are living in poverty.  We had the CSO figures of 2011, and the Irish League of Credit Unions report which showed that the majority of working people have less than \u20ac100 of disposable income left at the end of the month.  We had a report also from Social Justice Ireland which showed that austerity is not working and is leading to rising levels of deprivation, poverty and unemployment.<\/p><p>It is in that context that this State will bring in a family home tax, supported initially by Fianna F\u00e1il with the troika but to which it now says it is opposed.  This family home tax will put huge pressure on many families, yet we are allowing only three hours to debate it.  We will rush it through the House in the same way we did previously.  The reason this amendment Bill is being put to us is because it was rushed through the House on the previous occasion, and mistakes were made.  We are making the same mistake again by rushing it through the House today.  That is unacceptable given the impact that tax will have on ordinary families.<\/p><p>These items of legislation are being rushed through the Houses because the Government does not want to upset any of its backbenchers who might have difficulties with this tax.  It wants to rush it through without proper debate and not allow any type of campaign to take a foothold, but the reality is that many families are deeply worried and angry about this charge.  They will be very angry when they hear that, again, politicians, the people they elect, are not being given proper time to scrutinise this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600004#C00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1362566400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I raise the issue of the cost of drugs in the health service.

It relates to the treatment of Palestinians in Palestinian jails.  It arises out of the death, in circumstances which are being contested, of a Palestinian, Arafat Jaradat, in an Israeli prison.  I understand the results of the post mortem will be made public next week, and the Israelis say they may allow international observers access to the documentation.  As a result of the tragic death of Arafat Jaradat, there was an outpouring of anger, with demonstrations in the West Bank and a symbolic one day hunger strike by 3,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.<\/p><p>I want to contrast that with what is happening to Palestinians in Palestinian jails about which there is no protest or international comment.  Mr. Marshall refers to Palestinians, saying they are well aware that few people will stand up for them if they are taken into the police stations and prisons run by the Palestinian authorities in either Gaza or the West Bank.<\/p> <p>They know that torture is routine in these establishments and that deaths in custody occur.  This is supported by the Independent Commission for Human Rights, the official ombudsman for Palestine, which has documented the hundreds of illegal detentions and beatings administered by a Palestinian police force in the West Bank which is funded and trained by the European Union.  Between January 2009 and July 2012, the ombudsman received 584 complaints of torture and inhuman treatment in the West Bank alone.  Despite the volume of complaints, Human Rights Watch says it cannot find a single case in which a Palestinian official has been punished for serious abuse.

The House represents one of the two principal branches of democracy in the Oireachtas.  To lop it off without any proper discussion and without referring to the Conventional Convention, despite the fact that it is the most serious constitutional change in my lifetime, demonstrates a contempt for democracy that is quite astonishing.  I point to the precedent of Robert Mugabe, who, immediately on seizing power in Zimbabwe, abolished the senate there.  Even today, we find we are being prevented deliberately from exercising our proper function in adequately discussing legislation in circumstances in which the property tax Bill, an extremely controversial measure, will be guillotined, as it was in the other House.

We are lucky enough to have the great-great grandson of Brigadier General Thomas Francis Meagher, the man who created the Irish flag, in the House today.  The flag of the Irish Brigade which John F. Kennedy presented to the House when he addressed the D\u00e1il in 1963 hangs at the foot of the stairs leading to the Seanad Chamber.  He spoke about Brigadier General Thomas Francis Meagher who, like the Leader of the House, was from Waterford and a truly extraordinary man.  He came back from France in 1848 with two good ideas - one for a flag for which he borrowed from the design of the French flag, and the second for a revolution which did not work out so well.  He was involved in the battle in Ballingarry and put on trial in Clonmel for high treason.  Before passing sentence, the judge asked him whether he had anything to say, to which he replied, \"Your Honour, if you do not sentence me to death, I will try again.\"  He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to transportation to Australia for life.  When he was in Richmond Prison, just half a mile from this building, he wrote a famous letter in which he said, \"Never was their country so utterly downcast, so pitiful, so spiritless.  Yet I do not, could not, despair of her regeneration.  Nations do not die in a day.  Their lives are reckoned by generations, and they encompass centuries.

Kennedy referred in his address to the Oireachtas.  The highest compliment that could have been paid to him and his brigade came from Robert E. Lee, the commander of the Confederate forces, who that evening wrote of the Irish Brigade in his journal, \"Never were men so noble.  They ennobled their race by their splendid gallantry on that desperate occasion.\"  They had lost 850 of 1,200 men.  Brigadier General Thomas Meagher became the first Governor of the state of Montana and befitting a man who had had an extraordinary life, he had an extraordinary death.

When it was introduced approximately 15 years ago, those who availed of it were working and given mortgages based on that fact.  I know many who are now out of work and receiving social welfare payments who are not in a position to repay their mortgage.  As a result, in most cases, the county councils are parking the rental part of the scheme until things change for the owners of these properties.  I have made a submission on the matter to the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and estimated that in one case in my area the mortgage sum required 15 years ago was \u20ac35,000.  When that sum is repaid in ten years time, the council will be owed \u20ac30,000 by way of rental income forgone while the people concerned were enduring difficulties.  They will not be in a position to repay that \u20ac30,000 or go to any lending institution to borrow the money while receiving social welfare payments.  The councils should scrap the scheme, allow the people concerned to live in their homes and forego the amount that may be due.  This begs the question as to how much do the people concerned owe in property tax if the council owns half of the house?  Has this issue been dealt with?

The issue has been with us for some weeks and we have not seen the Minister.  I appreciate that he is busy and that, as Senator Pat O'Neill has pointed out, the CAP negotiations are exceptionally important.  However, any number of questions arise from the horsemeat issue.  A couple of weeks ago there was a public dispute in the newspapers between the Secretary of State for Agriculture in the United Kingdom and the Minister as to who had said what to whom about how the testing had commenced in Ireland and whether the horsemeat had been found as a consequence of a tip-off or as an intuitive response to the enormous slaughter of animals for meat.  There are also questions to be raised about whether the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has enough capacity and is conducting enough tests or whether the testing is at the minimum or maximum level.  Furthermore, I would like to know whether SIlvercrest is being sold on or sold off and whether some of the employees still being paid by the company were shipped in from Northern Ireland or eastern Europe.<\/p> <p> Last but not least, the \"Spotlight\" programme last night suggested that the relevant Department in the UK had written to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in regard to a tip-off it received about a company in Offaly last year.  The Department of the Agriculture, Food and the Marine seems not to know about that tip-off and said that it had not received anything, yet the Department in the UK said very specifically that it had sent that information to the officials here.  There are any number of questions about this issue, not least about the operation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, but also in regard to the horsemeat.  I urge the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come into the House and offer us reassurance.  As Senator O'Neill and I, among others, have said on previous occasions, this is an extraordinarily important industry in Ireland and the only way in which it can continue to be important and to build up what is there is if it is clean and if it offers the best meat and the best products not only here but across Europe.  The only way to do that is to clean it up.  I would like some reassurance from the Minister and form his officials that such a clean up is in operation, that the people who have been defrauding the system will be arrested and will stand trial and at the very least that the horsemeat saga would come to some conclusion because at this point it is doing some damage to our industry, damage we can ill afford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600006#E00900","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362568200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I second Senator Daly's motion and I compliment him and the Leader on bringing this motion before us.  It is surprising there is not an accepted protocol for the national flag.  We have guidelines on it and we all know those from when we were in school.  We knew when we could and could not fly the flag etc. and those guidelines were keenly observed.  Even today in the midst of cynicism, and perhaps even anger, there is still great respect for the national flag, whether it be on civic occasions or at sporting events.<\/p><p>There is a sense of history in the House this morning with presence in the Visitors' Gallery of the grandson of Thomas Francis Meagher, one of the iconic figures of Irish history.  Coming from Tipperary, I would refer to a battle as it has been referred to historically, the battle of the cabbage patch in Ballingarry.  It was obviously much more than that but that is the way it was referred to historically.  I hope the Leader will agree to review the Order of Business and allow for what the motion suggests.  <\/p><p>I support Senators Landy and Kelly on their comments regarding the shared purchase scheme for local authority tenants.  I understood that the concept of such purchase schemes, particularly the one that proceeded the one referred to, is threefold.  First, the purchase scheme gave a sense of ownership to the tenant, second, there was also question of ensuring provision for the upkeep of the House and, third, there was a sense that the rent the tenant paid was not dead money.  There is no doubt that there are anomalies in the current scheme.  It must be exceptionally frustrating for people who bought into that scheme because there are in a no man's or no woman's land.  It is as simple as that.  I hope the Leader, amidst all the other major issues which are raised here, will specifically focus on this one.  The fact that it has not raised its head too high does not mean that there is not huge suffering on the ground.  It would be helpful if the Leader could give priority to this issue.  There are good Ministers in office and I believe that any Minister would listen carefully to the detail of what has been put forward in the House.  I compliment Senator Landy on raising this issue.  By ignoring such issues we are adding to the anger, cynicism and the frustration that is already felt as a result of the recession.  People of no property often get ignored but people of half property, which comes with the shared ownership of property, are nearly in a worse position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600007#F00200","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1362568200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I want to raise an issue that I raised on 31 January 2012 concerning the landmark ruling that was made in the courts yesterday on assisted human reproduction.

That report contains 35 recommendations on assisted human reproduction.  We have seen again where the legislators have been superseded and the Judiciary has taken a decision that the Oireachtas will have to examine.

We had always understood the principle of <i>mater certa semper est<\/i>, motherhood is always certain, but now science has taken over and we, as legislators, have to catch up.

One of the saddest things I deal with in my day job other than the obvious health consequences of cancer in terms of mortality and morbidity is the possibility of premature infertility.  I have seen over the years a large number of patients who, because they were diagnosed with curable cancers that required treatments which would compromise their fertility before they had children or during their reproductive years, had the opportunity for parenthood taken from them in the awful trade-off or decision some have to make about whether they will take a treatment that might cure them even though it means that they may be left with this problem.  One of the little triumphs we live for is when we see people who have had that news come back to us later with children, often children who have been born as a result of assisted reproductive technologies of various kinds, which I do not need to go into in the Chamber, but also as a result sometimes of technologies which involve one or other of the forms of surrogacy.<\/p><p>I have seen many families where a family member who has been confronted with the prospect of possible early death and likely infertility comes back three or four years later if they have been lucky enough to have been cured and have children and I think this is what makes it all worthwhile.  Our State should put no impediments whatsoever in the way of as many people as possible achieving that happy outcome and I refer to people who suffer infertility not only as a result of cancer treatment but for other reasons.  I echo the comments which have been made.  The National Infertility Support and Information Group has called for legal clarity and legislation to regulate this sector.  This is consistent with the recommendations made as long ago as 2005 by the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction.  Yesterday Geoffrey Shannon, the rapporteur on child protection, referred to the current situation where individual parents are going to the higher courts as a failure of the Oireachtas.  Let us not have any more failures of the Oireachtas.  It is incumbent on the Government and the Minister to introduce legislation and regulation expeditiously.  <\/p><p>Following up on what Senator Norris said, this afternoon we will have an opportunity collectively as a body to make sure that there is not one more failure of the Oireachtas, which has been the failure of this House to seriously countenance the need for reform.

The figures confirm that visitor numbers from Great Britain have stabilised, which should provide a solid foundation for renewed growth in the market.  There is great room to improve the number of visitors from our nearest neighbour.

The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, signed the commencement order bringing the Act, other than sections 19 to 21 inclusive, into operation with effect from 1 January 2013.  Sections 19 to 21, inclusive, which relate to the local adjustment factor, will come into operation with effect from 1 July 2014.<\/p><p>The introduction of the Act met one of our programme commitments to the troika, which had to be completed by the end of 2012.  Senators will recall this commitment was entered into by the previous Government.  Given this troika commitment and the Government's determination to fix the national finances in a manner which supports job creation, we have chosen to implement the local property tax.  The local property tax will keep taxes on jobs, such as income tax, unchanged.  Recent ESRI research shows that a property tax has the advantage of being six times more job friendly than taxes on work and income.  This Government is determined to do everything in its power to protect and support the creation of jobs.  Yesterday's employment figures for the last quarter of 2012 were encouraging, representing the first annual increase in employment recorded since 2008.<\/p><p>This Bill is now being introduced to give effect to commitments that the Minister made during the passage of Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill 2012 through the Houses last December, in addition to some further issues that have since been raised as well as some minor technical amendments.<\/p><p>Before I go through the Bill in detail, I wish to draw the House's attention to the key positive amendments contained in it.  I also wish to point out, in response to some comments in the Lower House, that the Revenue Commissioners are legally independent in the operation of their duties, which will include the administration of the local property tax.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance has agreed with his colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, that houses demonstrated to be subject to a certifiable level of pyritic heave should receive an exemption from the local property tax.  The exemption may be claimed for three consecutive liability dates.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will provide regulations stipulating how residential properties should be tested for pyrite-induced damage.  These regulations will also provide for the issue of a certificate in respect of a property that has been verified as having a level of damage significant enough to warrant exemption.<\/p> <p> The Government is conscious of the difficulty some homeowners are experiencing in meeting their mortgage obligations.  Under new proposed amendments, a person who has entered into an insolvency agreement - that is, a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act - may qualify for a deferral of the local property tax that falls due for payment by that person during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect, where a valid claim is made to the Revenue Commissioners.  Further proposed new measures provide for the possibility of a deferral for owners who cannot pay the local property tax, when it becomes payable, without excessive hardship as a consequence of a significant and unexpected financial loss or expense.  This deferral will operate on a different basis from deferral arrangements provided for in the original Act.  A person must apply in writing to the Revenue Commissioners for the deferral and meet the criteria set out in guidelines to be published by the Revenue Commissioners.  Deferral cannot commence until the Revenue Commissioners have received whatever information and documentation they require to make a decision and, having made that decision, notified the owner that a deferral is allowed subject to whatever conditions they may impose in accordance with the guidelines that will be published.<\/p><p> The Bill allows for a reduction in the chargeable value of a property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided by a local authority.  The reduction is limited to the lesser of the following two values: the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property, and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief will not apply after the sale or transfer of the property unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.<\/p><p> The Bill also provides an exemption for a residential property that is purchased or adapted for use as a sole or main residence by an incapacitated individual where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court or where a trust has been established specifically for the benefit of permanently and totally incapacitated individuals.  To be exempt, a residential property must be acquired or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by an incapacitated individual.  To avail of the exemption, the adaptation costs must be greater than 25% of the chargeable value of the property before the work took place.  The exemption will no longer apply if the property is sold and the incapacitated individual no longer occupies it as his or her sole or main residence.<\/p><p> The Bill allows a personal representative of a deceased liable person, where that person was the sole liable person of a residential property, to qualify for a deferral on making the required valid claim.  The deferral may be claimed in respect of local property tax that was due and unpaid at the time of the liable person's death, local property tax that was deferred by the deceased liable person and local property tax that falls due in the three years immediately following death.  The Bill limits the period for which personal representatives may qualify for a deferral to three years commencing with the date of death.  However, if the personal representative is in a position to transfer the property to a beneficiary or to distribute the sale proceeds, where the property must be sold, the period of deferral ends at that point.  In all cases, the personal representative may be responsible for payment of the deferred local property tax when the period of deferral comes to an end.<\/p><p> As previously indicated, properties used for accommodation purposes by groups such as the girl guides or scouts will receive an exemption from local property tax.  This is on foot of a commitment given by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, during the Second Stage debate in response to a proposal set out by Senator van Turnhout, which we welcomed.  The Bill now provides for an exemption for residential properties used by a charitable body for recreational activities connected with its charitable purpose where this is not done on a commercial basis.<\/p><p> The chargeable value of all properties for which the liable entity is a local authority or an approved housing body will be deemed to be within the first valuation band for the first valuation period - that is, up to 31 October 2016.  Local authorities and approved housing bodies may also defer their 2013 local property tax liability until 2014.  This is to allow such bodies to put in place arrangements for the payment of the tax and for the valuation of their properties.<\/p><p> An amendment proposed to deal with issues arising where there is a change of liable person between valuation dates has been the focus of much media and Opposition attention in recent weeks.  Where the liable person changes between valuation dates the vendor will be obliged to provide the purchaser with details of the chargeable value that was established on the first valuation date, along with any relevant documentation.  Failure to comply may result in the imposition of a fine of &#8364;500 on the seller of the property.  The new owner is obliged to submit a revised return and chargeable value for the next liability date where it appears to him or her that the chargeable value declared by the previous liable person was too low given the circumstances that would have prevailed at the time that chargeable value was established.  These amendments are intended to act as a deterrent against under\u00addeclaration of the chargeable value of a relevant residential property by a liable person who intends to sell the property before the next valuation date.  Contrary to media coverage and other public commentary, the new provision offers a level of protection for purchasers.  In the absence of this amendment a deliberate and serious under-declaration of a property's value could be binding on a new owner or liable person where a property is sold before the next valuation date.  This amendment allows the purchaser to advise the Revenue Commissioners of what he or she considers to be the correct market value of the property, and relates only to the tax that would be payable by the purchaser.  Any issues with the original value placed on the property would be entirely and solely a matter between the Revenue Commissioners and the former owner.<\/p><p> I will outline the details of the sections of the Bill.  Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012.  Section 2 amends Part 2 of the Act by providing exemptions from local property tax for a residential property used by a charitable body for recreational activities connected with its charitable purpose and for residential properties purchased or adapted for occupation by permanently and totally incapacitated individuals.  I outlined these new exemptions earlier in my contribution.  Section 3 amends Part 2 of the principal Act to provide an exemption for a temporary period of at least three years for residential properties that have been affected by a significant level of pyrite-induced damage.  Section 4 amends Part 3 of the principal Act to clarify how it will apply in several situations in which an occupier has not taken steps to establish title on the property.<\/p><p> Section 5 makes several amendments to Part 4 of the principal Act relating to the charging provisions such as valuation of property and the rate of tax to be applied.  Sections 5(<i>a<\/i>) and 5(<i>b<\/i>) make amendments to section 14 that are linked to an amendment made to section 35.  As I stated previously, these amendments are intended to act as a deterrent against under-declaration of the chargeable value of a relevant residential property by a liable person who intends selling the property before the next valuation date.  Sections 5(<i>c<\/i>) and 5(<i>k<\/i>) are a combination of minor technical amendments and amendments that clarify the operation of the Act with regard to the local adjustment factor.  Section 6 proposes to insert a new section 15A providing for a reduction in the chargeable value of a property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided by a local authority.<\/p><p> Section 7 deals with residential properties owned by a local authority or an approved housing body.  The chargeable value of such properties is deemed to fall into the first valuation band - that is, from zero to &#8364;100,000 - until 1 November 2016, the valuation date for 2017.  In addition, the payable date for the 2013 local property tax liability is extended to 1 January 2014.  Section 8 makes several amendments to Part 7 of the principal Act regarding the return to be prepared and delivered to the Revenue Commissioners.  Sections 8(<i>a<\/i>) to 8(<i>c<\/i>) are minor technical amendments.  Section 8(<i>d<\/i>) is linked to the amendments in section 5.<\/p> <p>Paragraph (<i>e<\/i>) substitutes more comprehensive provisions for section 38 of the principal Act dealing with the linkage between late submission of a local property tax return and the submission of a return for income tax or corporation tax.  Late delivery of a local property tax return can result in an income tax or corporation tax surcharge under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Paragraph (<i>f<\/i>) makes a minor technical amendment.  Section 9 makes several amendments to Part 8 of the Act as regards estimates and assessments of local property tax made by the Revenue Commissioners.  Paragraph (<i>b<\/i>) will facilitate notification of Revenue estimates by electronic means.  Paragraph (<i>c<\/i>) facilitates appeals where an assessment is made in respect of more than one property.  The other amendments are technical in nature.<\/p><p> Section 10 amends Part 9 of the principal Act to allow an appeal by an owner against a determination of the appeal commissioners to be heard by the Circuit Court.  This is in line with appeal provisions in other areas of the tax code.  Paragraph (<i>c<\/i>) amends section 63 of the Act so that the appeal commissioners can require a liable person to provide information on any property and not just a relevant residential property.<\/p><p> Section 11 makes several amendments to Part 10 of the Act as regards the deduction of local property tax at source by employers, occupational pension providers and the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) amends the definition of &quot;net emoluments&quot; in section 64 in two respects.  First, it gives priority over local property tax to deductions by an employer or occupational pension provider under a court order, such as an order for the payment of maintenance, where such an order was issued before the direction to deduct local property tax was issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  Second, it allows deductions of local property tax to be made from a repayment of income tax, PRSI or universal social charge by an employer or occupational pension provider to a liable person.  Paragraphs (<i>b<\/i>) to (<i>g<\/i>) make minor technical amendments to ensure that the formulation used in several provisions is consistent and clear.<\/p><p> Section 12 makes several amendments to Part 11 of the principal Act in the collection and enforcement of local property tax by the Revenue Commissioners.  Paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) amends section 119 to clarify that local property tax is due on a liability date but may be paid on or before a subsequent date.  For example, the liability date for 2013 is 1 May but initial payments may be made on or before 1 July.  Similar provisions will apply in respect of future years.  Paragraph (<i>b<\/i>) amends section 120 in relation to a direction given by the Revenue Commissioners to employers, occupational pension providers and the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine to deduct local property tax at source when making payments to a liable person.<\/p><p> New subsections (2) and (3) disapply the requirement for the Collector General to issue a demand for outstanding tax when such a direction is given and allow the direction to be given after the local property tax is due but before it is payable.  However, tax need not be deducted until it is payable.  Paragraphs (<i>c<\/i>) and (<i>d<\/i>) are intended to clarify the original provisions.  Paragraphs (<i>e<\/i>) and (<i>f<\/i>) insert a new subsection (2) into section 126 to require a liable person who sells or otherwise transfers a relevant residential property after local property tax is due but before it is payable to pay that tax on completion of the sale or transfer.  Paragraphs (<i>g<\/i>) and (<i>h<\/i>), which were introduced by a Committee Stage amendment in the D\u00e1il, provide that any local property tax liabilities that were not established before a sale of a property will not be a charge on the property for the new owner.  Instead, the Revenue Commissioners will pursue the previous owner for payment of such liabilities.  However, such liabilities will continue to be a charge on the property where the new owner does not submit an honest opinion on the market value of the property to the Revenue Commissioners when required to do so on the first liability date following the sale.  Paragraph (<i>i<\/i>) inserts a new section 147A that establishes a way of determining a liable person's local property tax liability for the purpose of charging a tax geared penalty, that is, a penalty which is a proportion of the outstanding tax rather than a flat amount.<\/p><p> Section 13 amends Part 12 of the Act to introduce three additional categories that may qualify for a deferral of local property tax.  These include the personal representatives of a deceased liable person and an individual who enters into an insolvency arrangement - I have already outlined the provisions in this section.  Section 14 deletes sections 140 and 143 from the Act.  Section 140 is not a substantive provision and merely contains a definition of &quot;authorised person&quot; that is used in section 143.  Section 143 provides for the inspection of a residential property for the purpose of establishing the market value of the property by a person who is suitably qualified to do so and authorised to do so by the Revenue Commissioners.  This section was introduced as a Committee Stage amendment in the D\u00e1il.  Following from concerns expressed by various Deputies and Senators during the passage of the Act through the Houses last December, officials of the Department and Revenue have, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, reviewed section 143 of that Act and the Revenue Commissioners' power to inspect an individual's assets.  In light of advice received from that office, the Minister decided that section 143 should be repealed.  In conjunction with this, he has provided for a new general provision in section 98 of the Finance Bill 2013 that applies to the various taxes and duties under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners in the valuation of an individual's assets, including property.  The effect of the amendment being made by section 98 will be to require a person who has been authorised by the Revenue Commissioners to value a particular asset to obtain a warrant from a judge of the District Court where the occupier of a private residence does not consent to the inspection of the property or of any assets in the property.  This general provision will also apply to local property tax and to the inspection of residential properties.<\/p><p> It is anticipated that the need for the Revenue Commissioners to seek to inspect a residential property without the consent of the occupier should only arise on very rare occasions.  If the need for an inspection does arise, it is not anticipated that the occupier's consent will be withheld.  As a practical matter, it would be difficult to resolve a difference of opinion between a taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners about the value of a property without the Revenue Commissioners procuring a professional valuation of the property and this would necessarily involve an inspection.<\/p><p> Section 15 amends section 1094(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to ensure that outstanding local property tax liabilities are taken into account when tax clearance certificates are being sought in respect of the issue of certain licences, for example, licences for the sale of alcohol.  Section 1095, containing the general tax clearance certificate provisions, already applies to outstanding local property tax liabilities.  Section 16 makes minor technical amendments to several parts of the principal Act.  Section 17 contains the Short Title of this Bill, the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013.<\/p><p> As I stated earlier, this Bill is being introduced to give effect to previous commitments made by the Government made on the new local property tax.  Senators will be aware of the upcoming May liability date and filing deadlines.  In advance of these dates, and commencing on 11 March, the Revenue Commissioners plan to do a bulk mail issue of local property tax guides and return forms to all homeowners to assist them in their preparations for the new tax.  The passing of the legislation at this time will provide certainty to the Revenue Commissioners.  It will give homeowners time to consider the guide, assess their liabilities and make their returns on time, as well as assist in the smooth implementation of the tax.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600009#H01200","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362570600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  We have serious concerns about the format in which the property tax legislation is being introduced.  It is not a tax on income nor does it take account of ability to pay.<\/p> <p>Bringing in a property tax that does not correlate with people's income will put more people with mortgage difficulties into deeper and deeper trouble.  That has been our essential point all along.  In order to bring in a property tax, one needs first of all to look at the mortgage crisis where 30% of mortgages are either in arrears or have been restructured by the banks.  This shows the depth of the crisis but what it does not show is how much worse it will get because we have the lowest central bank rate in Europe at the moment with the ECB rate below 1%.  A total of 180,000 people are on tracker mortgages.  These were introduced by the banks between 2004 and 2007, which was when most of them were taken out and the highest prices were paid.  Those on tracker mortgages have the worst negative equity and the largest loans.  They are lucky to be on tracker mortgages because the banks have free rein and were not controlled by this or the previous Government when it came to raising interest rates on those who were not on tracker mortgages.  When the ECB rate goes up over the next three, four, five or six years, all those on tracker mortgages will become part of the group in arrears and difficulty and will need restructuring.  We are taking money from people through the universal social charge and cutting public sector pay, levying more tax and implementing more cuts.  When their mortgage bill comes in as the ECB bank rate goes up, we will have a larger mortgage problem.  I said before in this House that the guy who told us we needed to solve our mortgage problem was none other than Bill Clinton.  He said that at the Irish Global Economic Forum, the second anniversary of which is coming up in November this year.  We have not really tackled that problem at all.  We have brought in the legislation relating to debt and debtors yet we know this will only account for a few thousand people per annum.  That does not take care of the hundreds of thousands of people who find themselves in mortgage difficulties. <\/p><p>I am also an auctioneer.  Sending out estimate evaluations of properties will lead to widespread confusion.  I am confused and perhaps the Minister of State could clarify this on Committee Stage.  Will a scenario arise whereby if somebody honestly puts in a figure of \u20ac180,000 and sells the house in five or ten years' time, somebody from Revenue can decide that the person undervalued the house in May 2013 by \u20ac50,000 and, with penalties, now owes Revenue tens of thousands of euro?  The reason I am asking for clarification is because I have read different accounts in newspapers as to what happens in those cases.<\/p><p>I have asked the farming bodies whether they received clarification from Revenue about what happens when it comes to farmhouses adjacent to farm buildings and apparently they have.  As a valuer, I am well aware when one is adjacent to a farm building, one cannot sell a farmhouse without selling the farm buildings.  We were told by Revenue that one values the farmhouse, an acre and buildings but I believe farm buildings are to be excluded.  What that would mean is that any farmhouse adjoining slatted units or any of the commercial elements of the farm would be worth less than \u20ac100,000 because nobody will buy a farmhouse unless he or she has control of the adjoining sheds.  By virtue of the valuations method about which Revenue is talking, the Government is automatically ensuring that every farmer will pay under the figure of \u20ac100,000.  I would like clarification on that issue.  <\/p><p>There are so many anomalies.  The most significant issue raised on Committee Stage in the D\u00e1il was the ability to pay clause.  I know there are deferrals but those thresholds are not particularly high.  Deferral means that one is, to use that famous terminology, kicking the can down the road.  We have seen debt forgiveness for the multimillionaires and billionaires.  Here we have all these mortgage-holders who are struggling to pay their mortgages.  We levy a property tax and keep cutting child benefit and the income of garda\u00ed, which is of serious concern.  I am sure colleagues opposite are aware of cases where garda\u00ed are finding it difficult to pay their mortgages.  If a garda is taken to court for inability to pay, he or she loses his or her job because a garda cannot be declared bankrupt and still retain his or her job.  <\/p><p>We have not tackled the core issue.  If the mortgage issue was tackled, the Government bringing in a property tax would be seen as part of what we should never have done, namely, getting rid of the property tax in 1977, and would be seen as part of normal Government income and expenditure.  However, this is not a normal situation so bringing in a property tax now does not solve the problem in terms of Government revenue.  It just adds to the problem by ensuring people spend less money in the economy.  They are afraid their mortgages will go up and the tracker rates will go up.  We will then ensure that the economy continues to spiral downwards.  <\/p><p>I would like to get the Minister of State's view on when and if Revenue can tell people their property was undervalued on day 1.  As a valuer, I would find it very difficult to put an accurate value on people's houses.  There are three methods of valuation.  One does it by comparison.  There is very little moving so, therefore, how does one compare properties, especially in rural Ireland where properties can be uniquely different?  One can use a residual method where one gets the site value and the cost of building the houses.  We all know that one can buy a house for less than it would cost to build it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600011#K00200","speaker":"1159","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362571200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>The Senator's time is almost up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600012#L00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1362571200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I will conclude.  One can also use the income method.  We all know that rents have fallen in many areas and would not come near covering the mortgage or giving a return to any owner, given all the taxes and charges they have on board.  The ultimate issue is that it is the worst possible time to be bringing in a property tax.  Bill Clinton told us that we must solve our mortgage issue and we have not done that.  Until we do, our economy will continue to contract.  Bringing in a property tax now is the worst possible move.  It will not solve any problems.  It will just create more problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600012#L00300","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1362571200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>There is no good time to bring in a new tax at any stage anywhere because people do not like new taxes.  Realistically, one must make a decision.  Does one favour a property tax or not?  When one compares a property tax or increased income taxes, there is no question of increasing income tax.  Income tax increases are always a negative in respect of job creation.  I held a financial forum in my home town of Gorey a few weeks' ago.  There were 37 people at the meeting to whom we gave a simple choice between implementing a property tax or increasing income taxes.  I must admit that I was very surprised by the outcome.  Everybody favoured implementing a property tax over increasing income tax.  It was a private ballot where everybody had the option of putting it on the record.<\/p> <p> I was equally surprised when I read the amendments tabled by Fianna F\u00e1il.  This is not the television programme \"Dallas\" and Deputy Miche\u00e1l Martin is not Bobby Ewing.  He cannot step out of the shower and state we will ignore everything that happened in the past and pretend Fianna F\u00e1il had nothing to do with agreeing to the memorandum of understanding.  The Fianna F\u00e1il-led Government of which he was a senior member agreed to the introduction of a property tax under that memorandum of understanding and that is exactly what we are implementing.  In its opposition to the property tax - stating it is the wrong tax at the wrong time - Fianna F\u00e1il is being somewhat dishonest.  As stated, there is probably no right time to impose a new tax on the public.<\/p><p>In the context of its capacity as part of the Northern Ireland Executive, Sinn F\u00e9in has proved itself capable of implementing a property tax, a family home tax or whatever one wants to call it which is much more expensive than what we are discussing.  I was very happy when the Minister agreed to fix the local property tax until 2016 because this means there will be clarity and no equivocation.  For example, we will not be informed that the property tax will be doubled or trebled next year.  The tax may or may not increase after the next general election.  That will depend on who is in power at that point.<\/p><p>There is a need to highlight some facts.  The best guesstimate is that there are 1.8 million homes in the State.  We know that there are 750,000 mortgages on approximately 450,000 homes.  If one subtracts one from the other and then subtracts the result from the guesstimate to which I refer, it is obvious that there are 1.4 million homes which are not the subject of mortgages.  These are the facts.  However, there are others which we should not ignore.  I have stated on every occasion which has presented itself that there is a group of people who are in a particularly difficult position and to whom the property tax should not apply.  I refer to those who purchased at the peak of the boom from 2002 to 2008.  For whatever reason, these individuals' homes are in negative equity.  They paid enormous stamp duty on their homes and the personal insolvency legislation is not going to apply to them.  Senators may ask why this is the case.  As the Minister of State is aware, the legislation to which I refer will apply to those who find themselves in the very worst of circumstances.  We are informed that there are 45,000 such individuals.  Not everyone is going to go down the route of personal insolvency.  The people to whom I refer are those who will beg, borrow or scrape together the money to allow them to hold on to their properties and ensure they are not obliged to use the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act which is in place for those who have no other options available to them.  For some of these individuals, bankruptcy will be the only option.  A majority of people will opt not to avail of the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act.  In such circumstances, it would be wrong to oblige those to whom I refer to pay property tax.  I understand the Government does not want there to be many exemptions, particularly as this would lead to the system becoming diluted and the 1.8 million homes to which I refer becoming 1.4 million or 1.5 million.  <\/p><p>What angers those who paid the household charge most is that another coterie of individuals have not paid it.  As is the case with television licences, 80% to 85% of people pay, but the other 15% to 20% will not pay no matter what.  Those who have paid are satisfied to pay their taxes, as is the case with the vast majority of citizens within the State.  Those who do not pay because they do not deem it appropriate should be obliged to pay.  There should, however, be some leeway for those who purchased their homes at the peak of the market, paid enormous stamp duty on them and now find themselves in negative equity,  Those to whom I refer should be given a break.  If they meet very strict criteria, they should be considered to have already paid property tax in the form of stamp duty.  This could be done if there was a will to do it.  Such an action would show that apart from putting in place the personal insolvency route, the Government was listening and trying to do something for the people in question.  These individuals would not save a fortune if they were not obliged to pay property tax.  It is not a question of money; rather, it is one of principle.  If my suggestion was taken on board, it would demonstrate that the Government was prepared to do something for those who were caught out at the peak of the boom.  I ask the Minister of State to communicate my very personal and strongly held view on this matter to the Minister for Finance.  Many of my friends find themselves in the dilemma to which I refer and will not opt to take the personal insolvency route.  We should try to do something for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600012#L00400","speaker":"1160","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362571800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  Senator Mark Daly has stated this is the wrong time to introduce the local property tax.  I suppose it would have been better to introduce it when tax revenues were buoyant and income tax could have been replaced with a property tax.  In other words, we could have redistributed the burden of taxation rather than introducing an additional burden.  As the saying goes, however, we are where we are.  The previous Fianna F\u00e1il Government did not take the opportunity in this regard when it presented itself and people must remember this.<\/p><p>  I do not wish to get into a debate on the issues relating to the principal legislation, particularly as they were discussed in 2012.  The property tax will broaden the tax base and is necessary.  More importantly - this is an issue with which we have not really engaged - it will promote local accountability and improve local democracy.<\/p><p>  Some of the changes contained in the Bill are minor in nature, whereas others are less so.  I am happy that the Minister for Finance saw fit to listen to what had been said in the debates on the principal legislation in this and the Lower House and has brought forward amendments.  I hope other changes will be brought forward and that these will reflect the experience gained in introducing this new tax.  The previous tax was not a property tax, <i>per se<\/i>; rather, it was a form of rates.  Such rates were deeply unpopular because they were regarded as being extremely unfair and I would not like us to repeat the mistake made in this regard.  This is a new local tax which, it is hoped, has been designed to improve local democratic participation and will be re-evaluated in that context.<\/p><p>  I welcome the changes which place the properties owned by local authorities and voluntary housing associations in the lowest valuation band.  I accept that these valuations will only last until 2016, but it is an important recognition of the role of social housing.  They provide for a very important distinction between social housing and the remainder of the housing stock.  Many Senators come from local authority backgrounds and are aware that local authorities provide housing for those who cannot reasonably provide it from their own resources.  While tenants whose circumstances change have the opportunity to avail of tenant purchase options, the reality is that they pay, according to their means, through the differential rent system.  In theory, therefore, they are paying according to their means.  This is the difficulty when one introduces a tax which takes no account of individual circumstances.  In valuing social housing, there is a need to take into account the fact - this has been proved to be the case - that tenants in such housing generally are of very low means and do not have many resources at their disposal.  Many local authorities will not be in a position to place an additional charge on tenants.<\/p><p>  Valuing social housing is difficult.<\/p> <p>Tenants have security of tenure and maintenance costs are high.  There are successive tenancy rights, inheritance rights and so forth.  There is very good reason to believe that one cannot value social housing as one would value other housing on the open market.  It is very difficult to give an open market valuation.  I would argue that some social housing has no value at all, when one takes into account the costs that attach to local authorities.  I also welcome the exemptions given to properties used by charities for recreational purposes as this is an important recognition of social function.<\/p><p> I wish to give particular welcome to the exemption from the tax for houses damaged by pyrite.  However, I am concerned that it should be made as easy as possible for people living in these damaged properties to claim that exemption.  I suspect some of the houses damaged by pyrite could not be given away.  This does not take into account the trauma suffered by people living in these homes.  I am concerned that the legislation provides for the furnishing of a relevant certificate which will be provided for in regulation by the Minister.  I urge the Minister, when making this regulation, to bear in mind the difficulty already suffered by residents and that the cost of obtaining such a certificate should not be such as to make it more costly than the relief itself.  In my view, the relief should go beyond three years.<\/p><p> I refer to the other new categories of deferrals.  It is important to bear in mind that these are deferrals, not forgiveness.  According to <i>Stubbs Gazette<\/i>, it is estimated that 25,000 households will avail of the personal insolvency legislation.  There are many reasons to believe that this number could be higher.  I also recognise the attempt to try to deal with people who have suffered particular financial hardship as a result of the economic circumstances and that it will be open to the Revenue Commissioners to decide whether such people are given deferrals.  I agree with Senator D'Arcy with regard to people who bought at the height of the Celtic tiger period.  Stamp duty was a form of property tax and it must be recognised as such.  <\/p><p> One of the difficulties with this legislation is that it does not know whether it is fish or fowl.  It does not know whether it is a property tax or a local government tax.  It needs to be clarified how much of the &quot;local&quot; property tax will be spent locally.  If this tax is to be accepted by the ordinary man in the street, there needs to be absolute clarity as to where this tax is spent.  I know that members of local authorities, in particular, members of the larger local authorities, are concerned.  Their concern is that the local property tax will be used as an excuse to remove central government funding in a very significant number of areas.  That concern needs to be addressed.  If this tax is to gain acceptance there needs to be very sincere transparency and openness and very real clarity.  I would not favour more than 15% of local property tax being transferred outside of a local government area.  I accept there needs to be some transfer to those local authorities who will have a difficulty in raising taxation.<\/p><p> I wish to refer to a number of specific issues.  Areas of land in excess of one acre are exempted from valuation.  I understand that mirrors the Succession Act and other pieces of legislation.  However, in my opinion, adjoining land that is not used for business purposes such as farming, is contributing to the residential amenity and should be taxed as such.  This is not a frivolous point.  There are properties all over the country that have from two acres and up to ten acres of land adjoining them.  Properties on the hill of Howth and on Killiney hill have lands in excess of one acre.  These should be valued for residential amenity.  It is unfair to people, who literally have a handkerchief space in their back garden, that this is not the case.<\/p><p> I made the point about stamp duty.  Another important point relates to service charges for apartments.  At the moment, these charges range between &#8364;1,500 and &#8364;2,000.  This charge is to allow for privately provided services within apartment blocks which are not being provided by the local authorities.  Some recognition of that fact needs to be made.  I do not know nor can I propose how that would be done but it should be done.  It is certainly an incredible burden on people who live in multi-unit dwellings and it needs to be taken into consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600013#M00200","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362572400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker I wish to welcome a former colleague, Deputy James Bannon, and his colleagues from Longford Town Council, Councillors Paul Connell, Tony Flaherty and the town clerk.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  No tax is easy and certainly, no new tax is easy.  Unfortunately, due to the present economic environment and the challenging fiscal difficulties, there is little choice.  Property tax is an international norm in that most countries in the world have a very well-established property tax.  There are a number of very welcome elements to this particular tax.  It is set in stone for the next number of years.  This will bring certainty to the market for those purchasing properties.  Following on from the local elections in 2014, local authority members will have a certain scope as to the setting of their local rate.  I believe that future generations of public representatives will see this element of the tax being increased and local autonomy with it.  I believe that political reform and reform of local government funding will go hand in hand.  There has been significant political reform with a completely revised localised political agenda and there will be a referendum on the future of this House later this year.  Naturally, that has to go with providing people with more autonomy in the raising of funds.  The 15% element within the property tax is welcome.  I would like to see that provision developed in the future.<\/p><p>This is a very important incremental step in our financial recovery.  I commend the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for preparing people for what will be a long-term tax.  In my view, this tax will not be abolished.  It should never have been abolished in the 1970s in the first place.  We need a properly structured myriad of taxes.  This tax emulates best international practice.  We may not like it but it is a necessary tax.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600014#N00800","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1362572400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House but I do so as a formality because I cannot welcome what he has said here.  This is a loathsome, vicious and immoral tax.  I oppose the entire idea and I note that even the Minister himself acknowledges in his contribution that this was imposed upon us by foreigners.<\/p> <p>There are a number of extremely regrettable aspects to this tax and I will try to list some of them.  It has just been said that this is to be seen as a kind of local tax but I do not believe that for one minute.  Let us put this clearly.  We are now paying for our bin collection, which used to be a function of the local authority.  We will be paying for our water, which used to be free, and we are paying substantially increased rates of motor tax, which pays for the roads, so there is not an awful lot left.  We are paying for more of the services that were originally paid for out of rateable valuation and so on.  Let us not parade this as some kind of equitable local tax because it is not and cannot be seen as such.<\/p><p>This was imposed on us by a gang of foreigners.  We did not come up with this bright idea ourselves.  I am not particularly interested in the ping-pong between Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il as to which is responsible; I do not care a damn.  It is wrong and immoral.  This is taxing our homes.  I tried to get the Government to introduce a section on home protection but it did not do so.  Successive governments have failed to protect the homes of the people of Ireland.  The Minister of State is aware of this, and may even be in that situation, because I do not think we are all that grossly overpaid after all these cuts and so on.  I am sure he has constituents who simply cannot pay.  What will happen then?  Will the Government try to squeeze blood from a stone?  <\/p><p>A nasty aspect of this is that we have brought in the Revenue Commissioners.  One is not even allowed the opportunity to refuse to pay, to go to court and so on.  The Revenue Commissioners will simply bloodsuck it out of one's income at source, if it can, or defray it from one's bank account.  It will have powers of attachment and so on.<\/p><p>Prudent people who looked after and improved their houses will get another smack.  Each week in this House I listen to reasons not to celebrate 1916.  We have evictions, soup kitchens, rank-renting, informers - because we are being told that people who buy houses must inform on the people from whom they purchased them, and apparently some kind of spy in the sky, which I would like the Minister of State to clarify.  Is Google Earth or a helicopter being used?  It is absolutely indecent.  It really is Big Brother, and I certainly object to it.  <\/p><p>I am very surprised people would prefer this kind of tax to income tax because at least with income tax, one can evaluate the people who are capable of paying.  I do not mind paying more income tax - in fact, I would welcome it.  That is from where the State should be funded.  It should be centrally funded by taxation.<\/p><p>How on earth can one gauge or assess the value of a property?  The value of a property is notional; it does not exist until it is sold and it could be sold on different days for remarkably different values.  At auction, for example, one could be lucky one day to have two people bidding against each other.  If they have developed an irrational desire to possess a particular house, then the price could go through the roof but the unfortunate person who, in one sense, is the recipient of a windfall of good luck is penalised and treated as a criminal because he or she is told he or she undervalued the house.  It is almost like the Nazis in that one has to pay for one's own execution.  One has to value one's own house but there is no way of knowing how to do that.  I can tell the Minister of State one way to do so, which would be quite accurate, but nobody has thought of it except on the little island of Cyprus.  It is to take the valuation at the time the house is bought and add in a multiplier based on the number of years since that time and the variations in property values.  One would then get a real price.  Why should people be penalised for improving their houses or for building extensions?<\/p><p>I bought my house in a very dilapidated area and got involved in the whole preservation scheme and the start of the North Great George's Street Preservation Society.  I spent the last 30 years or so restoring the house, one room per year.  As a prudent person who was involved in the objectives of the State in restoring a historic building - through the negligence of the State the whole street had been allowed to disintegrate - apparently, I will now be whacked because it will be seen as a prime property.  Some years ago, it was on television and I suddenly got tax demands for furniture and stuff.  It is unbelievable what is going on in this country.  It is a load of nonsense.<\/p><p>I have tabled an amendment to the effect that listed buildings of historic and architectural value and so on within areas of special conservation should get an exemption.  There are exemptions, which are all nice - the girl guides' and the boy's scouts' dens and so on.  They are all rubbish.  There are pages of drivel about this in the explanatory memorandum, as if it mattered a damn.  The only exemption worth anything is the pyrite one, which was first brought up in this House, but of course the leader of the Minister of State's party is determined to abolish it if he can fool the people.  The Government is very coy about the rationale of the Bill, yet there is all this stuff about the exemptions, of which there are really very few.  <\/p><p>Then there is the question of deferral.  The Minister of State understands the suffering of the people but the idea of deferral is obnoxious in the extreme because people already have severe mental health problems because of the debts they are under.  If one proposes to defer, it is only an overhang - in other words, they will never get out of it.  Again, we seem to be punishing the prudent people.  <\/p><p>I will vote against the Bill and I hope that what was said by Senator Conway - that it will never be revoked - is not true.  Will Fianna F\u00e1il and Sinn F\u00e9in, which might well form a coalition the next time, revoke this Bill?  I would like to know the truth.  They should not fart around and say it is not the right time and so on.  Everybody will say it is never the right time to introduce a tax but it is certainly never the right time to introduce an unfair, unjust, immoral and partial tax which punishes people who have behaved well and produces a lot of silly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600014#N00900","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362573000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>The Senator's time is up.

The issue of property tax is an emotive one at such a difficult time in the economy, but there are many myths and rumours about.  One that keeps being trotted out by certain people is that we pay stamp duty but no one else in Europe does.<\/p> <p>In all of Europe people pay stamp duty or transaction tax on their properties.  I have researched the matter and discovered that the sum can range from 10% to 13% when it comes to notary fees and transaction taxes.  The public are being misled by comments that because stamp duty is paid in Ireland and not in any other county in Europe, there should be no property tax.  Those in Europe do pay.  Perhaps people should read more about the subject rather than discussing it over a pint somewhere and suggesting the claim as a good argument to put forward.  We have not really examined what happens in Europe but I know those fees are paid in Europe and there is proof.  <\/p><p>Like most people, I have a mortgage, but 40% of the population do not.  Some of them may not be well off, but some are quite well off.  If we exempt too many people, the tax will not be spread evenly.  As many as 40% of people do not have a mortgage.  Most of these could pay the property tax.  We must spread the burden.  <\/p><p>When I was a member of Donegal County Council I proposed a second home tax in 2001.  I am not sure whether Senator \u00d3 Domhnaill was there at the time.  My proposal was unanimously agreed by all the county council members.  At the time the then Government refused to adopt the measure because it was not feasible to collect a second home tax.  Subsequently, it changed its mind and the property tax was introduced.  If one travels to Donegal to stay in a second home in order to enjoy its beaches, roads and services, then one can well afford it.  A person who buys a second home in Donegal should pay for the privilege.  I do not want to pay my rates and tax in Donegal in order to provide services for people who will pay their property tax to Her Majesty's Government but refuse to do the same for the Government in the South.  Donegal County Council was struggling to maintain services.  The same people still live in their second homes.  They can afford to travel first class to America and get bailed out by millionaires in order to improve their health, yet they refuse to pay \u20ac100 to Donegal County Council.<\/p><p>I know people in Donegal who are not well off but still pay their property tax because they feel it is their duty to do so.  They want to keep Donegal clean and have its roads maintained and its beaches cleaned.  There was a bit of local resentment in Donegal because people felt that the British came over and the landlords were buying our property and developing and joining up farms because they had the money.  Those people are not doing so now.  There are still certain individuals who refuse to pay \u20ac100 to maintain the lovely county of Donegal.  There are many beautiful counties in Ireland, such as Cork and Mayo, but Donegal is probably the most beautiful.  I do not think anybody will contradict my claim, especially Senator \u00d3 Domhnaill.  <\/p><p>One is either for or against a property tax; it does not matter if it is \u20ac8 or \u20ac800 per year.  The stance adopted by the Sinn F\u00e9in Party in Lifford is for no property tax, and Senator Reilly can state her own case.  If one crosses the bridge in the town one enters Strabane, where the same party has recommended an increase in property tax.  My friends and relations live in Strabane and they pay \u00a3100 per month while their cousins in Lifford pay \u20ac100 per year, but they all state that there is no great difference in services.  The people I know who live in Strabane have a bin collection service but they may only put a bin out once a month or every two months.  Basically, they are pensioners, so the services they receive in Strabane are not much different from the services delivered in Lifford, where there is no property tax at the minute.<\/p><p>Deputy Pearse Doherty claimed on his local website that his party would abolish property tax, but I do not know if he was referring to Northern Ireland or Donegal.  What if he crosses the bridge into Strabane?  He will have to put an asterisk at the top of his website stating that his policy applies to UK viewers only and put another asterisk at the bottom stating what applies to people in Donegal.  If his party wishes to abolish property tax then it should do the same in Northern Ireland.  In the North there are no exemptions and every person who occupies a house must pay a property tax.  The argument is that this is David Cameron's law, but it is not, and people should admit that.  The tax is divided into a district tax and a regional tax, and the district tax is set by local councils.  The Sinn F\u00e9in Party is in the majority on these councils in most Nationalist parts of Northern Ireland, yet the property tax keeps being increased.  If it is good enough that people are exempted in the South, such as people with disabilities, then it is good enough for Northern Ireland.  Sinn F\u00e9in should not mislead the people of Donegal by stating that it wants to abolish the property tax.  I am sure that if Sinn F\u00e9in got its hands on the property tax for Donegal and the rest of the country, it would be a different animal altogether.  It would not be \u20ac100 per year or \u20ac90 per year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600015#O01000","speaker":"1144","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362573600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The Senator's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600016#P00150","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1362573600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I would like to make one more point.

Pages 59 and 60 of the manifesto decried what they called the Fianna F\u00e1il and Labour Party annual recurring residential property tax, and that was decried as unfair.

The Minister's colleagues in the Labour Party made a similar promise on page 16 of their manifesto, the document they used to convince voters to support them.

We must put our taxation system on a more sustainable footing.  The ravages of the 2000s were caused in part by the overdependency of the Exchequer on the market value of property and income from stamp duty and VAT payments on houses.  We now find ourselves with a deficit we are making progress to close but which continues to cause an enormous burden on many fronts.<\/p><p>I would like to see more transparency in the amount of tax to be collected.  There will be many questions from individual home owners.  I represent a city constituency and the case has been made by many speakers for Dublin.  I recognise that as a city, Cork has services which one would not have elsewhere but many of them are paid for by taxpayers, the bulk of whom are city dwellers.  We are told that this is a local property tax, the proceeds of which will be spent locally.  It will be based on market value.  More tax will be collected in areas where properties have a higher market value which means citizens will expect more services to be provided locally.  We need transparency to ensure that happens.  I agree that a certain proportion should be moved across the country to support local authorities which are not able to collect enough tax to match their needs.  The fact that the bulk of the tax will be collected in areas with high property values means individuals paying it will want to see how much money is being returned to their individual authority and how much is being spent locally.  Elderly people who find themselves in a house whose value has increased because of services which have been provided in the area will never actually realise that value.  They will have to pay a property tax based on that market value.<\/p><p>I support the implementation of a property tax which gets away from the focus on income.  We need to reduce the burden on income tax and I commend the Government for refraining from increases in income tax.  We must expand the tax base to ensure that, going forward, we have a more sustainable position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600018#R00400","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1362574800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  Nobody welcomes any tax.  This is one we debated some time back and we are not here to debate it again.  We are here to debate the exemptions.  I will make a few suggestions.<\/p><p>  Should we consider applying some discount where there are fewer than two residents in a property?  The exemption could be based on census figures.  In the United Kingdom, a discount of 25% is available when there are fewer than two residents in a building.  It would be interesting to consider that in the context of the Bill.  More occupants usually means it is easier to pay.  An amendment would therefore be appropriate.  I am interested in a number of exemptions and whether they should be stated explicitly in the Bill.  If a bank repossesses a property, is it liable to pay the property tax?  It is just a question.  Are diplomats and people in prison liable to pay the property tax?  One might ask why I have raised such specific examples.  In some EU member states, exemptions in these circumstances are clearly provided for in legislation.  Should we amend our legislation to clarify the position here?<\/p><p>  I found no mention in the Bill as initially drafted or as currently presented of occupiers aged under 18 years.  Perhaps we should consider an exemption where a house is occupied by people who are all under the age of 18.  I wonder also if we should consider amendments to cut out those elements of confusion for the citizen or consumer.  Given the valuations of houses, will the Minister consider an amendment so that some universal benefits could be withdrawn from those who paid property tax on a house valued over &#8364;1 million?  Given the problems of means testing, this might be a way to introduce a more equitable system of social welfare.  I wonder if we could introduce an amendment to that effect.<\/p><p>  While we need to balance the books and I support the legislation, we must pay heed to the wider situation, particularly the mortgage crisis, which a number of speakers have mentioned.  Anecdotally, I hear that people have over the last few months stopped spending.  I have heard this from some business people, one of whom runs a garage and says there has been quite a drop in custom.  People are thought to have ceased to spend in anticipation of the new property tax.  I hope the Government will take on board the message that we are at about saturation point on the Laffer curve.  The Laffer curve demonstrates that at higher rates of tax, less income is taken in by the Exchequer.  At lower rates, more income is taken in.  If there are green shoots of recovery, the Government must not go on increasing taxes.

The Sinn F\u00e9in position on the property tax is completely dishonest and we need not talk about it.  The Fianna F\u00e1il position is worse than dishonest; it is ludicrous.  Fianna F\u00e1il was the proponent two years ago of the exact same policy to which it is now completely opposed.  It has made the argument that the property tax should be linked to income.<\/p> <p>If it was linked to income it would be called an income tax not a property tax.  If it was linked to stamp duty should it not be called a transaction tax?  The argument that people in rural Ireland pay substantial development charges represents a misunderstanding of a development charge.  It is a contribution towards the capital cost of infrastructure.  A property tax is a contribution towards maintenance and ongoing services.  They are basic arguments and for anyone to use them in any other way would be dishonest and might demonstrate a lack of understanding of the tax system.<\/p><p>It is a good thing for our democracy that the Opposition would robustly criticise and oppose any measure obnoxious to them and obviously the introduction of a property tax fits into that category.  I fear, however, that the Opposition is going further than opposing the introduction of legislation and moving into a position that is insidious and I daresay subversive.  Some parties have a history of subversion but I am surprised to find Fianna F\u00e1il moving into that area.  It is one thing to oppose the legislative process.  That is fine.  It is the job of the Opposition and it must do so robustly but to take it outside the Chamber and exhort people not to pay the property tax is moving to a position of denying the legitimacy of a democratically elected government to make decisions on taxation.  I am not saying Fianna F\u00e1il is doing this but other parties are.  That is subversive.  It is an inability to recognise the legitimacy of the State which we in the Parliament represent.  That is insidious and horribly dangerous.<\/p><p>Those who are on the streets telling people not to pay this property tax, bin the tax or whatever, should realise that street politics is not appropriate for parliamentarians.  We are dealing here with the very legitimacy of the State.  The Government is elected to implement decisions in good times and bad.  This is the key issue.  Nobody wants to pay more tax, as Senator Quinn said.  I do not want to pay more tax.  It is a legitimate measure from a legitimately elected government.  To move outside that is subversive, dangerous and wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600018#R00800","speaker":"1117","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362575400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>This debate is not about a local property tax per se.  It is about the inbuilt inequities in that tax and its method of implementation.  There was a build-up of misunderstanding at the time of the household tax which was a single charge for everyone.  While it was an interim measure it has left a legacy which is the background to the local property tax.  There is widespread fear about the valuation, apart from the fear of not being able to pay.  There was some relief when people were told they would receive an estimated valuation which they could appeal but after some weeks it became clear that even if one accepted the estimated valuation one could be pursued.  That was not good management.  It recreated and accentuated the fear that existed.  I suggest that when one gets an estimated valuation and responds in good faith and pays that should be the end of the matter.  If one wishes to appeal so be it but it would be well worth reconsidering that even at this late stage because there is a lot of misunderstanding about it.

As a result these anomalies will be widespread.  People will say that if it is fair and equitable they should respond positively and correct the State's finances just as they did when the first household charge came in.  People in one area will pay more because of the location although the house and overheads are the same as those in another area which has a lower valuation.  To my way of thinking a house is a house.  Those who have the most should pay the most.  The exemptions in the Bill are too limited.  Even the idea of certified insolvency where there is a mortgage involved is restrictive.  We even heard this from the other side of the House.  Many people who are insolvent will not want to go down that road.  They will want to hold onto their property whatever else happens.  That is not a major exemption.  The one for charities is welcome and well-thought out, and was needed but it is still very limited.  What about the people who cannot pay?  All the statistics available show that there are many people who have no money left at the end of a week or a month after paying for the necessities.  Deferral is like borrowing another mortgage that one cannot pay.  We should add to the exemptions.  Senator Quinn has put forward some ideas.  They should be even broader than his ideas.  We are still working against the protest mentality that has existed since the first household charge.  People should pay what they have to pay.  We would do a better job if it was very clear that it is not punitive to the point that it might be deducted at source in some cases from people who may be on a limited sum and unable to pay.  That is a bit penal and sends out the wrong message.  It does not make it easy to implement this tax.<\/p><p>Although we have advanced the legislation I would like the Minister of State to consider the question of valuation again.  He might consider broadening the exemptions because there is scope to do that without undermining the basic work he has to do.  Even if the overall valuation is not implemented in the first year, basing it on location is not necessarily the right way to go.  I would not like to see people who are not in a position to pay, who are already suffering, frustrated and angry come under any extra pressure.  I do not wish to be alarmist but there is a very high suicide rate in this country.  I know of several cases, not to do with this tax, of suicides directly connected with financial issues.  Some of them were very sad and very worrying.  Let us make sure we do not create an environment that drives people over the cliff.  I do not think the Minister or the Government want that.  There is a time for a bipartisan approach and this is one occasion when we could work on the anomalies and inequity and fine tune this tax even though it will never be popular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600019#S00400","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1362575400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I have listened to the usual suspects talking about the local property tax the way they talked about the household charges and septic tanks.  They are the very people who have inflicted extra charges on people.  They persuaded people not to register their septic tanks and now those people must pay much more and cannot qualify for grants.  They did the same with the household charge and those people must now pay much more as a result of being told by some parties not to pay.<\/p> <p> We are facing the same problem with the local property charge.  This Government was brought in to fix the national finances in a manner which supports work and job creation.  People are talking about income taxes but further increases in income tax would have a very negative impact on job creation.  The Government has said that on numerous occasions.  The local property tax is six times more job friendly than taxes on labour and that comments comes not from the Government but from the ESRI.  In designing the tax, the Government has ensured that it is fair and progressive with owners of the most valuable property paying the most.  <\/p><p>The local property tax will be used to pay for vital public services including local enterprise and job supports; fire services, road maintenance which is mentioned on the Order of Business daily, libraries and recreational amenities.  The tax also takes into account people's ability to pay it through a series of deferral arrangements, as was advocated by the Minister this morning.  As a measure of fairness, the vast majority of people will pay something and the Revenue will ensure compliance and collection of the tax.<\/p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il signed up in 2010, in its negotiations with the IMF, about which it did not tell anybody, to the proposed introduction of a property tax with the objective of raising \u20ac530 million by 2014.  In its latest prebudget submission it also left in the flat \u20ac100 household charge.  That is the record of Fianna F\u00e1il in terms of this property tax being in place.  <\/p><p>As regards Sinn F\u00e9in, it opposes the introduction of this fair and progressive tax but it appears to have no problem whatsoever with there being a property tax in Northern Ireland where the owner of an average house pays approximately \u00a31,000 in domestic rates annually.  No deferrals are provided for people irrespective of whether they live in council houses or mansions in Northern Ireland.  <\/p><p>This is a fair tax on assets and such a tax is commonplace throughout the developed world, of that there is no question.  The reason Sinn F\u00e9in along with other so-called socialists would oppose this tax, I suggest, is a tribute only to their political opportunism.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners will be looking after this tax.  The Minister has outlined the deferrals and the exemptions for households.  I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600019#S00500","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362576000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Following on from Senator Cummins, in many ways we wish we were not here but at this stage of our consideration of the Bill we have added, under the agreement, \u20ac10 billion to taxation, and public expenditure is still rising.  We discussed that on the last occasion the Minister of State was in the House.  We have become a high tax society.  This is different from saying we will substitute the property tax for less tax on income.  This tax will increase the overall tax burden and, as several Members said, the burden is really hurting people.  We must address the issues addressed by Croke Park II and other issues such as those raised in the report on child benefit, the appendix to which shows that the Irish level of social provision is among the highest that one would find anywhere.  It is difficult to address all of those when our employer - I am referring to people who are paid from the public purse - is broken.  In trying to remedy that situation, extra schemes involving public expenditure cannot be pursued in the current situation.<\/p><p>This tax has been described as a stable source of income but it is not.  If it had been applied in 2006, the revenue from it would be down by about 60%.  Somebody in the Civil Service wrote that this is a new stable source of income but having regard to Irish property prices it is not.  I guess the State is taking a gamble that house prices will rise.<\/p><p>Development levies should have been considered in this context.  They were hidden in the price of houses in the boom and people paid ten of \u20ac10,000 in levies.  It is a bit like heads I win, tails you lose.  Homeowners paid tax upfront in stamp duties on their properties, but the State has changed that and people do not pay stamp duty now but they pay tax on an annual basis.<\/p><p>The valuation process requires some thought.  What about property values in high crime areas?  I read the other day that 4,000 people have been arrested for a spate of burglaries.  There was a massive spate of burglaries in areas about which locals would have known and they would have said that part of living in the area was the risk that one's house would be burgled twice a year.  That problem is now under control but do the Revenue Commissioners know where high crime areas are?<\/p><p>As I said to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, when he was last in the House, if irresponsible bankers break out again and give a person a loan of a daft amount to buy the house next door, what happens in terms of the price of every other homeowner's house in that row of houses?  There was such irresponsibility previously.  Would it have been possible for anybody to live near the Burlington Hotel when the property industry went nuts and hundreds of millions of euros were paid for sites and there were residential properties nearby?  What happens if once again we have irresponsible bankers on the loose going on lending sprees?<\/p><p>Another consideration is county council planning decisions.  If a council approves planning for a toxic dump beside a house, can the owner include in his or her evaluation the possibility that the county council planning office would go AWOL and grant permission for such a facility?  If something in a planning department goes wrong and an area is rezoned and people's houses are seriously devalued, can those people, having paid the tax for a number of years, get a refund?  How would such a scenario be handled or would their properties still be valued at the highest limit?<\/p><p>There is constant pressure in the Irish media to talk up house prices.  If such pressure succeeds and a ministerial colleague comes up with new tax incentives and despite all the evidence we go for a property boom again, that would not give any extra disposable income to people who see a house as being purely a place to live in.  That is the problem with treating a house as an asset.  It damaged this country hugely.  Let us just have houses as places to live in and pay for the services that the Minister of State has described.  There will be such pressures, as newspapers depended greatly on revenue from property advertisements.  They are all the time saying we need a new incentive to start another property bubble but that would seriously damage people who will not have the extra income to pay the higher tax and all they want to do is to live in their house.  <\/p><p>Income always declines for old people.  At best, their income could decline by a half and, as the Minister will know, some pensions schemes are so small, that people's income could decline by  up to 60%.  Some consideration should be given as to how they can pay the tax.  <\/p><p>In terms of trying to design a house tax system, perhaps the old poor law valuation system was not that bad after all in that it did take account of size.  We have moved to a market value system which has many imperfections .  <\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the legal independence of the Revenue Commissioners, a body that scares people.  Are pensioners who genuinely have a decline in their income going to be put on the list of tax defaulters?  The Minister of State referred to the inspection of the property and covered the issue of an honest opinion of the market value of a property.  I think most people will be honest but it may not be an evaluation with which the Revenue would agree.  We should assume that people will be honest in making their submissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600020#T00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1362576000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gilroy for his good wishes.

In towns like Dunboyne and Ratoath, which are in the top 13% of house prices nationwide according to the register of property prices for last year, no account is taken of mortgages, commuting to work or the extra costs of these families.  It is deeply unfair.  Another issue is the level of service people get from local authorities.  Having paid development levies in a rural area, when people see the potholed roads and no prospect of it getting fixed when they pay the property tax, they are not inclined to want to pay the property tax.  They want to comply with the law, as Fianna F\u00e1il does, but we can see the frustration people have when they see basic items left undone because of a lack of funding.  In housing estates, people are expecting the grass will be cut or that residents associations will get more help from local authorities.  That is not likely.<\/p><p>This is the wrong tax at the wrong time.  No one, not even the IMF, told the Government to introduce this tax.  The Government has renegotiated the IMF agreement on a number of occasions.  One of the best examples of renegotiation is the reduction in capital spending expenditure with the IMF.  The Government did not want to spend the money on capital expenditure, such as roads, and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport boasted last year that \u20ac400 million was cut from the road budget and no one noticed.  That renegotiation was a Government choice, just like the property tax.  No one told the Government to include people with very high mortgages or those on social welfare and no one told the Government to be so blatantly unfair.<\/p><p>One specific issue, which has an impact on a number of households in south Meath, is pyrite.  I welcome the exemption for those houses with pyritic heave but people are asking a number of questions.  The standard test for pyrite in a house costs between \u20ac2,000 and \u20ac3,000.  Will that test be required for people to get an exemption?  That will take the good out of the exemption.  Another test is that someone comes in with a spirit level and checks the house or conducts a basic visual inspection.  One can see whether houses have pyrite or have suffered from pyrite damage.<\/p><p>Another issue concerned housing estates where some houses have pyrite but others do not.  All houses in such estates are unsaleable.  This is a major issue in going to the Revenue Commissioners and saying the value of the house is zero.  If I want to buy a house in certain estates in south County Meath, I cannot get a mortgage for any of the houses on the estates, regardless of pyrite damage.  I hope the Minister of State is dealing with that point and hope to get the answer.  I do not see the answer in the legislation.  It will affect certain houses and not others, depending on the phase of building.  However, all houses will be tarred with the same brush.  I welcome some of the measures the Government has announced in respect of pyrite damage but I would like to see it being done quicker.  I have been constructive in my support for the Government.  There is much uncertainty for these people and they are asking me for answers.  I am sure they will be asking people in Meath East over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Fundamentally, this is a deeply unfair tax and it will hit people really hard.  People do not realise the amount they will have to pay but they certainly realise the lack of services.  We are often blamed for abolishing household rates in the 1970s but at the time they were very high and were a huge burden on families.  Sinn F\u00e9in is running a no property tax campaign in Lifford but in Strabane, which is essentially the same town, they have increased the local property tax by the highest rate in the North of Ireland.  These are questions Sinn F\u00e9in must answer in respect of property tax.  I have always been opposed to property tax because I see its impact in County Meath, particularly in the commuter belt.<\/p><p>The Bill should be opposed and it is not true to say we have had a full debate on it.  One of my colleagues said that this was the day for amendments and that we had a day for the property tax.  We have had guillotined debates rushed through before Christmas and the Bill is now being rushed through before a by-election.  This is deeply unfair to the people because they are not getting the full time to debate the issues.  It is being handed down from on high while everyone is doing their work preparing for it, although the legislation has not yet been passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600021#U00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1362576600,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I am quite amazed at some of the comments I heard this morning in the Chamber.

I ask that other Senators in the Chamber give me some respect and allow me to make the points I am allowed to make.  I have four minutes to make my contribution.<\/p><p>  I am amazed Senator Thomas Byrne can walk into the Chamber with a brass neck and say he was against the property tax when his party signed the country up to a property tax with the troika under the national recovery plan, the infamous four-year plan.  This is the same Senator from the same party that introduced the universal social charge and four tough, gruelling austerity budgets that had a deep impact on many working families.  The same party threw away the sovereignty of the State and brought about massive unemployment, with hundreds of thousands of young people scattered across the globe, in America and in Australia.  Hundreds of thousands of people are in negative equity and people cannot put food on the table or heating oil in their tanks.  People are really struggling.  All of the evidence points to more people living in poverty today than two, four or six years ago.  Senator Thomas Byrne and the Fianna F\u00e1il Party must take full responsibility for all of that because he was a cheerleader for all of those policies and those in government who were putting the policies in place.<\/p><p>  Labour Party and Fine Gael Senators must also take responsibility for the fact that poverty and levels of deprivation have increased.  Senator Maurice Cummins talked about dishonesty.  I challenge him to a public debate in Waterford on the issue at a time of his choosing.  If he wants to throw mud and engage in a debate on the issue of the property tax, I challenge him to a proper debate.  Let us remind ourselves of what Fine Gael said in the election manifesto.  They were elected on the basis of what they put to the people of the country in their manifesto.  I will read directly from it, on page 59 under the local government funding heading: &#8220;Fianna F\u00e1il&#8217;s proposal, now endorsed by the Labour Party, to introduce by 2014 an annual, recurring residential property tax on the family home is unfair.&#8221;  I agree it is unfair.  Before the election, Fine Gael felt it was unfair and now the party seems to think it is fair. <\/p><p>  The Leader of the Seanad said it is a tax on assets.  It is not a tax on assets, it is a tax on the family home.  Many assets are not being taxed.  When Deputy Enda Kenny was asked about a property tax as the Leader of the Opposition in the D\u00e1il, the record of the D\u00e1il shows he said:<blockquote>It is morally unjust and unfair to tax a person's home, and by so doing grind him into the ground.  Indeed in cases it could probably be unconstitutional. [...] It reminds me of a vampire tax in that it drives a stake through the heart of home ownership, through enthusiasm and initiative, and sucks the life blood of people who want to own their own home and better their position.  <\/blockquote>I agree with the Taoiseach that it is a vampire tax that will suck the lifeblood out of communities.  It will suck the lifeblood out of families who are really struggling.  The Minister of State is sitting there but does not understand what it is like for most families.  He does not understand how difficult it is for people to make tough decisions about whether to pay the electricity bill, which many more people are finding it difficult to do, to put oil in the heating tank, to pay the gas bill, get groceries to put food on the table or send their children to primary and secondary school.  The Minister of State is sitting there with an empty expression on his face because he lives in a bubble with his inflated salary.  He has no idea whatsoever what it is like for those families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600021#U01400","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1362576600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Senator Cullinane receives the same salary as the rest of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600021#U01500","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1362577200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>The Minister asks us to support a grossly unfair, unjust and regressive tax which is not based on ability to pay.

The 150,000 people who bought houses during the boom paid on average &#8364;10,000 in tax on their properties.  Now, they are expected to pay this new property tax.  We are presented with a <i>fait accompli<\/i> in the Bill.<\/p><p>  Today's newspapers report that the Revenue Commissioners will not send valuation letters to 65,000 taxpayers registered with Revenue Online Services.  Being self-employed, I am one of those taxpayers and had been anticipating receiving a valuation letter in the post.  Now, it looks like I will have to make contact with my accountant, my representative in dealing with Revenue, to establish how I will find out what the valuation of my property will be.  Will putting this information online coincide with the letters being sent in the mail?  Will the Minister consider informing the 65,000 people who may be waiting for a letter and find themselves penalised later for having forgotten to pay?  This arrangement may sow some confusion, a point the Consumers Association has raised.  If I had not seen this report in the media, I would not have known that this was the only way I would find out the valuation of my property.

I defy anyone who has spent seven hours at an ECOFIN meeting at the Justus Lipsius building, like I did yesterday, not to have a vacant look on his or her face the next day.  The Senator also claimed the Government lived in a bubble.  It is a dangerous move in politics to presume that other colleagues do not know the circumstances we all face.  No one is swinging from the chandeliers of this fine House singing, &#8220;Yippee, a local property tax is being introduced.&#8221;  No one on this side of the House is claiming this tax will be popular.  It is inevitable when we are trying to repair the national finances that we have to broaden the tax base.  The ESRI's statement that a property tax is six times less harmful on employment, enterprise and getting the domestic economy going than taxes on income is worth mentioning.<\/p><p>  I agree with Senator Sean D. Barrett that we have reached saturation point on taxation, as I stated in a recent article in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>.  In 2008 in 12 months the taxation base collapsed from &#8364;50 billion to &#8364;35 billion.  We have to fill the hole.  This has nothing to do with the banks or the debt but with the fundamental problem that the taxation base, over a period of 15 years under the previous Government, was built on an unsustainable property bubble.  One third of all tax revenue collected was stamp duty.  In 2008 we fell off the financial cliff and moved from a tax take of &#8364;50 billion to &#8364;35 billion in 12 months.  Our expenditure, however, did not change that radically and we have had to fill this gaping hole in the public finances.  I agree that the property tax will widen the tax base, but it is not harmful to employment.<\/p><p>  Even in the good times, we should have had the courage to consider introducing a property taxation system.  Sinn F\u00e9in claims this is not a progressive tax.  This is, however, a wealth tax in another name.  Extensive houses in extensive locations with a marketable value are a form of wealth.  To suggest those at the top of the tree will not pay more is fundamentally wrong.  This is a fair tax which replaces the unfair tax of the domestic charge.<\/p><p>  We had a debate in the House on this issue before December.  The Minister for Finance and his colleagues in the Department listened closely to what colleagues here had to say.  In the amendments to the principal Act we have attempted to reflect some of the problem areas, although I am not saying there may not be changes in the future.  There will be changes to the operation of the tax which is a fundamental change to tax law.  There is a responsibility on all citizens to pay this tax.  I take the point made by Senator John Gilroy that when laws are made in the Oireachtas, we all have a responsibility to enforce them.<\/p> <p>It is unfair to attack the Revenue on this issue.  The Revenue is simply doing a job that has been tasked of it by the Houses, assuming a majority of Members support the tax.<\/p><p>This is a change in taxation policy.  It involves widening the taxation base.  It is helping in a constructive way, as opposed to attacking employment, to bring tax and expenditure into better kilter.  The evidence is available.  In every other western European country there is some form of local property taxation based upon funding local services in local areas.  It would be delusional on the part of some people to believe that we can ignore that now in the middle of this economic crisis.  The Government stands over this measure.  By no means are we deliriously happy with the prospect of introducing it but we are doing so because it is the right thing to do at the right time, to coin a phrase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600022#V01700","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1362577800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 29; N\u00edl, 17.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators David Cullinane and Kathryn Reilly..<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600023#W00200","aye":["1148","1121","1138","1150","1114","1165","1151","1124","1158","1130","1160","1117","1144","1172","1131","1152","1135","1161","1162","1132","1174","1134","1118","1170","1129","1125","1145","1163","1171"],"nay":["1157","1147","1133","1159","1140","1149","1128","1136","1122","1123","1115","1139","1142","1154","1155","1126","1164"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1362578100,"counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600024#X00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1362578100,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1362578100,"counter":179,"content":"<p>NEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578100,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are out of order.

The Minister of State referred to recent ESRI research and suggested that the property tax has the advantage of being six times more job friendly than taxes on work and income.  However, I argue that it is unfair and non-egalitarian because it contains only the tiniest element of taxation according to one's ability to pay.  He noted that it is a type of wealth tax but, as I pointed out in my contribution to the debate in December, we are only taxing the house or the family home as opposed to the wider legal definition of property that would be encompassed by a wealth or assets tax.  Even if this tax is more friendly to the domestic economy than a tax on income or work, how many additional people will it tip into mortgage arrears?  The Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste, in reviewing the programme for Government today, stated that they want most families on mortgage arrears to be offered a sustainable solution by next year.  What will this tax on debt do for people who are in mortgage arrears?<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 3 is grouped with amendments Nos. 6, 10 and 17.  This group of amendments is designed to exclude certain categories of properties and persons.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 6 seek to include liabilities arising from negative equity in the chargeable value under the terms of the tax.  A property tax is meant to be a tax on an asset but people who live in negative equity own a debt not an asset.  Given that they cannot realise any value from their property, they will be paying tax on their debts.  This amendment would ensure that when a property is being valued the negative equity is deducted from the current market value.  Amendment No. 6 re-emphasises this point, while amendment No. 17 repeats the proposition.<\/p><p>  It says something about the Government if it believes it acceptable to tax a debt rather than an asset.  The family home tax is full of such anomalies.  People who live in the private rented sector will end up paying the tax even though they do not own the asset.  Local authority tenants will face a similar fate.  These anomalies demonstrate that the tax is not a property tax in the normal sense of that term.  It is a tax on the privilege of living in a family home, irrespective of whether it is owned or rented, and regardless of whether it has any real value.  I will be pressing amendment No. 3 for these reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600024#X00700","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578100,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 17 deals with the negative equity with which many people are dealing.

Would the Minister of State be able to stretch things and give me an answer?  It has not been ruled out of order or grouped but simply states that residential property shall be regarded as a relevant residential property where the property is a building listed for protection as being of historic architectural or cultural interest in a special conservation area.  That is in direct line with the Government's objectives, is limited by two factors and would help give the Government scope to protect the great historic houses that have been acknowledged in a debate in this House by a Government Minister within the past couple of weeks as being a very important element in the development of cultural tourism.  I am thinking of houses such as Birr Castle, Westport House, Kilruddery House and Glin Castle.  These will all end up derelict if we do not do something to protect them.  This harks back to the days of punishing the alleged Anglo-Irish, although many of these people, such as the O'Conors of Clonalis House, are remnants of the ancient Irish nobility.

Obviously, we considered this issue, but were guided by the recommendations of the Thornhill report, which was the initial report for which the Government asked before coming to a full decision on this.  The report made it clear that deferral systems are a better way to go.  It is worth putting on the record of the House that this does not apply to people with incomes of less than \u20ac15,000 and couples with incomes of less than \u20ac25,000.  There are strong sections within the Bill which allow people in negative equity to defer this charge and tax until such time as they are up on their feet again.  We have gone down the route of deferral as a means of helping people in negative equity.<\/p><p>It is worth pointing out that one of the promises my party gave at the time of the last election, which was supported by the Labour Party, was for an increase in mortgage interest relief for people who bought houses between 2004 and 2008 to recognise the fact that this cohort of the population was badly affected by negative equity.  We delivered that in our first budget.  I am not suggesting that this has made a huge difference to people's personal income, but it has made some difference and is what we said we would do during the last election.  We are conscious of the difficulty experienced by people in negative equity.<\/p> <p>That is why the deferral system is in place.<\/p><p>We have done everything in our power to keep the rates low.  Senator Michael D'Arcy has stated the rate is 0.18%.  We have given a commitment that neither this rate nor the position on valuations will change during the lifetime of this Parliament.  As a result, there will be certainty for those who must pay six months worth of the tax this year and a full year's worth in 2014 in the context of what they will be facing.  Some 80% of people live in homes with a valuation of \u20ac300,000 or less.  If one took the latter amount as being the maximum, those in the cohort to which I refer would pay a charge of \u20ac540 per year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600025#Y01900","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362579300,"counter":206,"content":"<p>That is a lot for some.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600026#Z00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1362579300,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I accept that it is a lot of money in circumstances where people have very little.

We are confident that in the context of the deferral system which is being tweaked in the legislation before the House, we are doing our best to assist those of very low means or whose homes are in negative equity.<\/p><p>It is worth stating the Bill needs to be passed in order to give Revenue full powers to proceed with the next stage of the implementation process relating to the tax and also to allow it to give guidance.  That guidance will be crucial for all homeowners in assisting them in understanding the valuations which have been arrived at.  Where a person honestly values his or her house on foot of guidance from Revenue, there will be no further questioning of that value.  If honest mistakes are made, people will not be criminalised.  We are going to work to ensure the assessments which will be sent by Revenue in the coming weeks will reflect people's perspectives on value.  However, there is a substantial degree of self-assessment involved.  If people choose to challenge the system, they are entitled to do so in the context of the legislation.  They must be able to show the basis for their valuation of their properties.  If a person whose home is in negative equity or someone of very low means chose, for example, to defer payment for 20 years on the trot, the total liability at that point would be less than 5% of the value of the house in circumstances where it was to be sold.  <\/p><p>I accept that people have genuine concerns about this matter.  I have been advising elderly constituents and they should get their loved ones to pay the tax on their behalf at some point in the future.  I accept this is a real issue for people, but it must be remembered that what we are talking about is such a small percentage of the total value of the property.  The substance of the amendment relates to exempting people whose homes are in negative equity.  We are of the view that the deferral provisions we have included are fair and balanced and that they will allow us to raise the tax, while also recognising the very difficult position in which those whose homes are in negative equity find themselves.

In effect, we are penalising people who cannot afford to pay the property tax by charging them interest.  Why we have to do so is beyond me.  This is clearly a punitive measure which is being applied to those who may be forced into opting for deferral.

Regardless of whether those to whom I refer like it, I must make the point forcefully that we are referring to people on very low incomes who are being given the option to defer.  If they choose deferral, it will mean that they will be obliged to pay interest.  The Minister of State is essentially saying they should not pay the property tax and should allow their loved ones to pay it for them when they die.  I do not believe that is fair.  In the context of dealing with low and middle-income families, there are better ways to proceed and I certainly will not take lectures from the Labour Party on this matter.<\/p><p>It is not true to state the tax will remain the same up to 2016.  I accept that the Government is not going to increase it, but we know that, regardless of the spin in this regard, local authorities have been given the power to increase the charge in 2015.  They will also have the power to reduce the charge.  We are all wise enough to know that if a local authority uses the powers at its disposal to do anything, it will be to increase the tax.  It will certainly not be reduced.  God only knows the level to which property tax will rise post-2016.  The Minister of State referred to small and reasonable amounts and accepted that it would be difficult for some families to pay the tax.  The average payments will be \u20ac225, \u20ac315 and \u20ac405 annually.  Most people will broadly fit into one of these three payment categories.  Any of the amounts in question will be huge for families genuinely struggling and suffering.  There are better ways of raising the money required.  It could, for example, be done by means of the income tax system rather than by imposing a tax on family homes which do not generate income.  That is the core philosophical point I wish to make.<\/p><p>The Government has not done enough for people whose homes are in negative equity.  It has not done enough across the board for those who are finding it difficult to pay their mortgages.  Even in introducing this charge, it simply has not done anything to support the families to whom I refer.

For the overwhelming majority, buying a home is their major investment and they pay for it for most of their working lives.

This is how relief will be directed rather than giving an exemption to those who currently own the property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600027#AA01700","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1362579900,"counter":230,"content":"<p>That is old hat and of no use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600027#AA01800","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1362580500,"counter":231,"content":"<p>As it is now 2.45 p.m., I am required to put the following question in accordance with the order of the Seanad of this day: \"That amendment No. 3 is hereby negatived, in respect of each of the sections undisposed of, the section is hereby agreed to in Committee, the Title is hereby agreed to in Committee, the Bill is reported to the House without amendment, the Bill is hereby received for final consideration and the Bill is hereby passed.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600028#BB00012","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1362580500,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1362580500,"counter":233,"content":"<p>The Seanad divided by electronic means.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1362580500,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Under Standing Order 62(3)(<i>b<\/i>), I call for the division to be taken other than by electronic means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600028#BB00050","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1362580500,"counter":235,"content":"<p>As Senator Cullinane is a teller, he is entitled to call a vote through the lobby.<\/p>                                                 O'Keeffe, Susan.","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600028#BB00100","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"vote","time":1362580800,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 28; N\u00edl, 19.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators David Cullinane and Kathryn Reilly.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600029#CC00075","aye":["1148","1121","1138","1150","1114","1165","1151","1124","1158","1130","1160","1117","1144","1172","1131","1152","1173","1135","1162","1132","1174","1134","1118","1170","1129","1125","1163","1171"],"nay":["1116","1147","1133","1159","1140","1149","1128","1136","1139","1125","1122","1123","1115","1154","1145","1155","1126","1164","1176"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Early Intervention and Economic Benefits: Statements","time":1362580800,"counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600029#CC00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1362580800,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600029#CC00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1362580800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and also thank Senators for putting this topic on the agenda.  <\/p> <p>I am delighted to be given the opportunity to address the House to discuss the importance, significance and benefits to be gained from early intervention.  It is a key area of activity in my Department.  The debate is an important follow-up to previous discussions here on child and family services, and most recently on youth work.  <\/p><p> I have no doubt that all of the Senators are aware that a substantial volume of valuable research now exists on the benefit of intervention during the early years.  While much of the research emanated, in the first instance, from the US and other countries in Europe, I am pleased that we have seen a number of comprehensive child-centred research projects get under way in Ireland in more recent times, not least my Department's Government funded survey entitled Growing Up in Ireland.  There are now many longitudinal reports and evaluations of various pilot projects taking place.  It is very good to be in a position to say that we have home-grown Irish research as opposed to relying on international research.<\/p><p> The international research environment involves diverse disciplines such as neuroscience, genomics, sociology and economics coming together to provide a more complete and complex picture of childhood development.  Neuroscientists armed with new technologies have given us great new insights into how the brain works and what inputs are needed to optimise its development.  Pioneering experts like Professor Michael Rutter, Professor Sophie Scott in the UK and Dr. Bruce Perry in the US have shown the sensitivity of the human brain in the first three years and the learning that can take place with the right stimulation.  They also showed the downside.  If there a lack of stable emotional attachment or chronic stress or neglect there is a great price to be paid by children, not just emotionally.  We now have research that shows that there are cognitive, emotional and behavioural impacts.<\/p><p> A new development has taken place in the past number of years.  We have begun to quantify the costs associated with early problems.  For example, Professor Sophie Scott of London University has calculated that for a child with a conduct disorder the cost to the economy is ten times more than that for a child without the disorder.  That is very significant so the question then relates to the interventions that we need to make. <\/p><p> Similarly, economists can now estimate in financial terms the short-term economic contributions of quality early years interventions and the longer-term returns on investment.  Several long-term studies have documented significant savings in the areas of remedial education, school drop-out rates, welfare and crime and more international research is being carried out.  Senators will be interested to hear about the international papers on this type of research and to learn that more economists speak about the long-term benefits of early intervention and the economic return.  Of course I shall focus on that today.<\/p><p> Obviously the personal and individual return for the children and their families is a primary concern and is absolutely enormous.  Economists can estimate long-term savings.  In the paper that I have circulated Senators will see that reference was made to the very famous Perry Preschool Project in the United States which followed 123 children until the age of 27 years.  They attended preschool for two years for 2.5 hours per day and received home visits from the teacher once a week.  For every $1 invested in the Perry Preschool Project the benefit was determined as over $16.  I shall also quote research by Columbia University which found that the medium-term savings to the state from investment in early care and education, over the lifetime of the child, ranged from over $2,500 to nearly $10,000 per child.  There were also savings if one had the right universal programmes in place.  I attended a presentation which provided very detailed economic data on savings.  For example, savings were made from not having to put money into crime, addictive behaviour and detention centres.  Researchers were able to track the children who had received the right interventions and estimated that very substantial savings were made.  These studies were validated and evaluated.   <\/p><p> Similar studies have been conducted in Ireland.  The National Economic and Social Forum made the case for State funding for universal preschool.  It stated, &quot;It can be readily justified as the longer-term societal benefits that would accrue on the basis of the investment are at a ratio of 1:7.&quot;  A very famous graph was produced by James Heckman from the University of Chicago.  He won the Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences.  The graph is known as the Heckman curve but I shall not go into it in too much detail.  He made the convincing case for early investment.  He concluded:<blockquote>The returns to human capital investments are greatest for the young for two reasons:<br \/>(a) skill begets skill and <br \/>(b) younger persons have a longer horizon over which to recoup the fruits of their investments.<\/blockquote>It is clear the kind of returns that one gets.  <\/p><p> The return is not just economic.  We also have research on the impact of educational issues.  Along with the Taoiseach, I recently attended a British-Irish Council summit in Cardiff.  One of the items on the agenda, and I think that it was the first time ever, focussed on the early years.  Each country shared what was happening in terms of interventions and early school programmes.<\/p><p> Northern Ireland has benefitted from recent developments in early education.  Two recent global surveys have indicated that Northern Irish primary pupils performed better in reading and numeracy tests than any other English speaking country in the world.  That is the result of the radical restructuring of its foundation stage education.  It was backed by an accompanying investment in training and professional development which have been identified as a key factor contributing to the success.<\/p><p> Research was also carried out by the Geary Institute at University College Dublin which found that, &quot;Children who spent any amount of time in centre-based childcare prior to school entry were rated higher than children who did not experience any centre-based childcare in the domains of social competence, language and cognitive development, and communication and general knowledge.  I am talking about quality child care with proper staff training and the right interventions at the right age.  There are issues concerning children aged zero to three years, how best to help the age group and the kind of supports that more vulnerable children need.  The latter is a topic in its own right.<\/p><p> Another research project has been conducted in Ireland that I shall briefly outline to Senators.  I refer to the work that is being done in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale funded by Atlantic Philanthropies.  Significant interventions in these three communities have been evaluated.  There has been a whole range of interventions ranging from public health nurses working with families, parenting programmes that tackle behavioural and emotional problems, and programmes to support literacy and promote social skills and emotional understanding in children.  All of these programmes impact on the child when he or she enters primary school and moves through the education system.  As a result the children cope much better with various life challenges.<\/p><p> Increasingly we should think about putting therapeutic services into schools such as speech therapy and occupational therapy because many parents miss clinic appointments.  Pilot projects in the early years sector and schools have resulted in much higher returns in terms of availing of supports.  The programmes have been a real benefit.  I do not need to elaborate the point much further because Senators are familiar with the benefits.<\/p><p> The question then is how can early intervention influence policy and the services that we deliver as a country and Government.  Ireland lags behind other countries when it comes to its early years sector.  That has begun to change in recent years with the introduction of the universal pre-school year but that is just one year.  As many as 94% of families avail of the early school year which provides important opportunities to support children and the Aistear framework has been put in place.<\/p><p> We also have the community child care subvention scheme and the child care education and training support scheme.  We also have a new after-school programme that provides 6,000 places.  However, we have a long way to go and many challenges remain.  We have major issues with the affordability and accessibility of child care here.  We need to do more to support families.  At this point in our development we are faced with the challenge of how best to support and regulate child minding which is an informal sector.  Should it remain informal and left to parental choice?  I have asked the early years group to examine whether we need to provide more support to child minders.  I want to see childminders working more effectively with local child care committees to ensure that their work is supported. <\/p><p> We need to assess what is the best form of child care for children under one year of age.  If one follows the Nordic model one will find that the extended parental and maternity leave benefits the under ones more.  Parental choice is also given more support in terms of those early years.  That is a vision that we ought to have.  <\/p> <p> We also need to have greater linkages between our primary education system and early years education.  Norway, for example, has the same training for those working in early years education and those working in primary school.  We do not have much interaction between our primary schools and our child care settings, although we are beginning to see more of that in some communities.  Those challenges cannot be dismissed.  We need to examine them, and that is the reason I welcome this debate.<\/p><p>Our preschool population has increased, according to the 2011 census, by nearly 18% since 2006.  We have more children in the country, which is a massive resource.  It is a national treasure offering immense potential, and it should impact on our planning in the future.  Other countries are not as fortunate.  Instead of seeing our child population as a cost we ought to realise its huge value, not just in terms of the children but this country's economy on which we are focusing today.  We must deal with the huge economic challenges we face to ensure we can give to those children the kind of future we believe they should have.<\/p><p>The point I am making is that early intervention must become even more a part of our national psyche than it is at present.  There is a real need for the dissemination of this kind of information to ensure we understand the difference it would make if we invest in these early years.  We need to invest more.  As Dr. Anne Buchanan said at the COFACE conference some weeks ago, it should be an economic imperative.  We are not used to hearing such language in this country about investment in early years.  We talk a lot about the economy, but we rarely link it to the kind of investment we need to make in our children.  Investing in children's early years should be an economic imperative.  <\/p><p>The OECD agrees.  The 2011 economic survey of Ireland recognised the importance of investing in early years, emphasising that in order for Ireland to preserve its strengths in human capital, we should recognise the importance of preschool education having both a positive impact on later educational performance and an equity enhancing effect.  The direct benefits for young children themselves are well known to the Senators.  <\/p><p>It is a direct activation measure as well, and the potential for job creation in this area should not be overlooked. The free preschool year currently supports approximately 7,000 jobs, and every ten or 11 additional child care places we provide will create one new job.  A second free preschool year could generate a significant number of jobs.<\/p><p>Is it realistic to be talking about more investment in this area as people who have been discussing this recently have asked in articles in our newspapers?  Is it realistic to talk about universal services?  We have to examine the way we spend our money in this country.  Compared with Ireland, Nordic countries spend significantly more on child services, supports for families with young children, well-paid parental leave and a high proportion of child care, but they have lower poverty rates.  It is interesting to see that the choices they make in terms of investment work well in terms of support to families.  It also deals with the child poverty rates as well as other factors.<\/p><p>We have a strong history of direct cash payments as opposed to services.  Clearly, families need child benefit and direct payments but there is a stark contrast in terms of what we spend on services compared with direct cash payments.  That is a feature of the policies we have undertaken in this country.  Given the information that is coming out about early years interventions and supports to families, it is an area worthy of discussion.  There is a growing acceptance that the spend on direct services is too small a proportion of the State's overall spend, and I believe that proportion needs be increased.<\/p><p>The publication last month of the report of the tax and welfare advisory group raises the question of how we should reassess our overall levels of spending on service provision, in particular on early intervention and child care services, which improve children's outcomes while also supporting parents.<\/p><p>I have spoken here previously about the early years strategy group under Dr. Eilis Hennessy who will be reporting to the Department in the next few months.  A wide group of professionals who are interested in this area will be coming forward with recommendations, which will help us to consider the kind of investment we need to make in the early years.<\/p><p>There are also a number of initiatives in the budget regarding the area-based poverty initiative.  I have given Senators the details of those.  We need to ensure that the learning from the projects I spoke about earlier is mainstreamed throughout the country because we have made the investment of \u20ac30 million.  We now know what works and what we must ensure is that services to children throughout the country, whether they are being given by public health nurses or social workers, take the lessons from the research about the kind of initiatives that work with the families I have mentioned in terms of the parenting, the health visitors going into the family, the detailed work on literacy and the one to one work, all of which is being done in different projects throughout the country.  The big task now is how we mainstream that and make sure that more children benefit from it rather than simply the pilot projects.<\/p><p>In the next few weeks I will be moving to establish the child and family support agency, which has a dedicated focus on child and family services.  There is a significant body of work under way in the Department.  We are focusing on early intervention.  There is much more we can do. Further investment is justified by the figures we have and the research that is emerging.  As we say, t\u00fas maith leath na hoibre.  There is no question that a good beginning is a big part of the work.  There are many lessons for us in the economic analysis of early intervention, and there are lessons for both our budgetary strategy and our policy development in the next few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600029#CC00300","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362581700,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to the House.  She is always welcome, and she had a successful time here as a Senator.  I again congratulate her on getting the referendum through last year, the benefits of which will come to fruition in time.  Every decision taken now can show the benefit of that referendum, particularly the right to adopt children from a so-called married family situation, which was an anomaly that deprived many children of a second chance.  That was one of the most significant points in that referendum, which was unanimously passed.<\/p><p>We in Fianna F\u00e1il welcome the Minister's commitment to develop a national early years strategy and the setting up of the expert advisory group to advise the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on its preparation.  We believe the Minister must make a commitment in the early years strategy to put in place the supports that will be required to deliver high quality staff and positive outcomes.  I compliment the Minister on her detailed contribution which provided comprehensive information.<\/p><p>The OECD 2011 economic survey of Ireland emphasised that for Ireland to preserve its strength in human capital, we should recognise the importance of preschool education in having both a positive impact on later educational performance and an equity enhanced effect.  In that regard, one of the major successes of the previous Government was the establishment of the preschool year.  Fianna F\u00e1il is proud of its prioritised investment in the early education and child care sector during its time in government and is committed to ensuring that early education for children continues to be a policy priority under this Government.<\/p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il welcomes the setting up of the new expert advisory group.<\/p><p>The free preschool year is vital, and I compliment the Minister on maintaining that.  It was an area on which she would have come under a certain amount of pressure, but it was important that she held the line on that because a possible option at the time would have been to remove it.  The preschool year in early childhood care and education was introduced by the former Minister of State, Barry Andrews, in January 2010.<\/p> <p>Children are eligible to participate in the scheme if they are between three years and three months and four years and six months in September of the relevant year.  The scheme has been an outstanding success.  In September 2010, approximately 4,300 preschool services - 95% of all such services - were participating in the scheme and 63,000 children - 94% of all eligible children - were availing of the preschool year.<\/p><p>I have seen at first hand the benefit of the preschool year for children.  I benefitted myself from a wonderful preschool life as the youngest of eight children who was at home with my beloved mother who was born in Glasgow.  Every family cannot have that one-to-one preschool education with a very intelligent woman.  We listened to Scottish music and chat on the radio and I was very reluctant then to go to school as life was so wonderful and pleasant on The Walk in Roscommon town.  While the surroundings were humble, the most important thing, namely, love, was present.  The knowledge that he or she is wanted and loved is the most important thing for a child.  Eventually, I went to school in Roscommon and decided that having a schoolbag was not a very good idea.  I hid mine for a month or so and it meant a much nicer time.  I was blessed to meet Sr. Anthony, my first teacher, at the Convent of Mercy in Roscommon town.  She was a wonderful, beautiful person who died recently, God be good to her.  The classes were large with up to 50 children in the room.  She provided us in the first years with love and individual respect as if every one of us was that important.  Her ability to do that for every boy and girl was key.  The classes were mixed which was lovely.  Teaching and teachers are vital to the confidence one builds up.  I look back on those years which had a very simple but sound quality.  The Sisters of Mercy and other orders have come in for severe criticism in relation to the Magdalen laundries which is tragic, but the teaching provided at primary school level was second to none.  The nuns were well-qualified as teachers and had a nice, humane approach.  That is my personal experience.<\/p><p>The work the Minister is doing is vital to allow children to have the confidence to learn.  Learning is a continuing experience, as the Minister knows.  I was in a different Government Department.  One is given so many briefs and discussion documents and learns all the time.  Not every family can have one parent at home - both may have to work - but I have witnessed through my granddaughter the excellent work that is being done in preschools.  There is a lovely, confidence-building approach.  Whatever else the Minister does, she should maintain the service.  It would be wonderful to expand it.  It is not free, it is paid for by the State but it gives families a great start.  The interactions between children at that age are wonderful.  They learn continuously and the earlier they are exposed to education, the better it is.  Early language learning is very important also.  It is not the Minister's responsibility, however, but that of the Minister of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>Appointees with responsibility in this area previously included Brian Lenihan, Brendan Smith and Barry Andrews, but Deputy Frances FItzgerald is the first at Cabinet level.  Her predecessors were in the Cabinet room which was a step in the right direction.  She has taken over and built on their work.  I wish the Minister well in her work.  She is doing an extremely good job and I wish her success in setting up the agency.  She has a great deal of work to do and has my full support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600031#EE00200","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362582300,"counter":244,"content":"<p>It is always lovely to have the Minister in the House and reminds us how lucky we are to have a Department solely for children and youth affairs.  Since the Minister was in the House last, we have had the children's referendum in respect of which I congratulate her on her hard work and success.  When she replies, she might update the House on what has happened since the referendum was passed.<\/p><p>When she was first appointed and given responsibility for a full Department, the Minister said she would do her best to create a seamless new approach to policy development and integrated services for children with the ultimate objective of ensuring that children are cared for and protected and have the best possible start in life.  She is almost two years in the position and has done a great deal of work on those matters.  We must focus on what is best for children.  All studies point to the importance of the best possible start and early intervention.  Early intervention in children's lives and high-quality early childhood experiences are crucial to a child's emotional, cognitive and social development.  It is regrettable that Ireland has been behind many countries in its early years sector.  For too long, we have placed the emphasis solely on supporting parents rather than on providing supports for the development of the child.  That era is at an end.  We know now that children must come first.  The Minister is observing that.<\/p><p>The Department has provided targeted support to parents to assist them with the cost of child care.  This support has provided for three child-care support programmes: the early childhood care and education scheme, which is the free school year; the child-care community subvention scheme, which supports nearly 24,000 children in community creches; and the community employment and training scheme, which provides approximately 2,500 full-time equivalent child-care places.  In 2012, total expenditure on these programmes was approximately \u20ac240 million.  I am pleased that the Minister has committed to maintaining the universality of the preschool year, despite increased demand.<\/p><p>The Minister and her Department have done a great deal of work during the preparation of Ireland's first ever early years strategy which is expected to be completed this summer.  We must always strive to provide a range of services which are affordable and accessible so that parents can better balance work and parental responsibilities.  Child-care provision supports not only the participation of parents in the labour market but, as the Minister said, represents a direct job activation measure.  It creates jobs.  The preschool year currently supports approximately 7,000 child-care jobs.  For every ten or 11 additional child-care places provided, a new job is created.  It is all progress.  We are moving in the right direction with speed and commitment.  We have a committed and dedicated Minister who is determined to see change occur.<\/p><p>Recent years have seen welcome changes.  The universal free preschool year scheme has a very high take-up rate.  Some 95% of three to four year olds are participating to avail of a high quality service.  It means children with special educational needs or who have suffered from neglect come into contact at an earlier age with child-care professionals.  They are assessed earlier because their problems are noticed earlier and they get a better start.  Simple matters such as a child getting spectacles when he or she is two or three years old rather than when he or she is five or six years old can make an enormous difference for the better.  Early intervention will play a significant role in Ireland's future economic planning.  It is increasingly accepted internationally that there are economic benefits accruing from investment in children's early years.  Long-term studies from the USA, UK and France show returns to the economy of between three and ten times the original investment.  In the studies, children who experience high-quality preschool provision have been shown to be higher achievers in education and employment.  The benefits also transfer to the next generation.  I am pleased we are carrying out our own research domestically.  We are obtaining significant information which allows us to cost the services we need.<\/p><p>The Minister attended with the Taoiseach, the last British-Irish Council summit in Cardiff at which the success of Ireland's preschool year was discussed.  Scottish Government representatives spoke about the innovative national parenting strategy which seeks to support parents to secure the best outcomes in respect of their children's development, health and well-being.  In Northern Ireland, a study on the effective provision of preschool education demonstrated that irrespective of the level of disadvantage, children with little or no preschool experience show poorer cognitive and social behavioural outcomes at entry to school.<\/p> <p>Children who had little or no preschool experience show poorer cognitive and social behaviour outcomes on entry to school at the end of year one than those who attended preschool.  I wish the Minister luck and congratulate her on the wonderful work she has done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600032#FF00200","speaker":"1152","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362582900,"counter":246,"content":"<p>As always the Minister is more than welcome to the House and we are delighted that she is here.  Her statement and speech to us today are seminal.  It should be circulated generally.  She was very fair in trying to give us a summary of what she has said to us today and it lays a strong foundation for a new home for children.  I cannot commend enough what the Minister has said.  More people should read her statement.  We often focus on only one part of a child's life but it is important to consider the child's journey.  I thank the Minister for providing that vision and starting this discussion with a very strong foundation.  Everybody supports prevention and early intervention but it is music to our ears to hear a Minister promoting these strategies and putting them first and foremost.  All too often people only talk about these theories in seminars and symposia while in the House we talk about firefighting and dealing with crises and do not give prevention and early intervention the thought and deliberation that they need.<\/p><p>  I welcome the area-based approach to the child poverty initiative but have a difficulty with the selection criteria for the three new sites and the additional four that will come on stream.  How do we ensure that the selection process is transparent, that the programmes are rooted in evidence and best practice?  Programmes may look good but how do we ensure that they provide the outcomes for children and the delivery that we all want ?  I want to see more details.<\/p><p>  Often when we talk about early intervention we refer only to early years.  That is why I welcome the Minister's speech because she has looked at the child's journey, the key transition points, the flash points in a child's life that are all too often missed.  This is true of disability services, where life chances are affected at an early age if we do not intervene when the child is very young.  Mental health problems tend to become more apparent in early adolescence.  The Minister mentioned the Heckmann curve.  In 2010 Cunha and Heckmann wrote a working paper on investment in our young people.  Their research showed that the effect of early intervention in the lives of disadvantaged children is reduced if it is not followed up by investment at later stages.  We all talk about the importance of investment and what we reap from investing in early years but if we do not provide that continuum of support the investment is lost.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Minister's focus on how to provide services and the suggestion that we might take a step back and ask what is the purpose of child benefit and how do we ensure that it delivers the outcomes it should and that people want.  The Minister mentioned the advisory report on which we had a good brief debate in the House with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, which we will continue.  We were glad that she came in so soon after the report was published.  There are different ways in which we can provide services and support to children.  Should we consider the affordable, accessible and quality child care, or extending the scheme to a second year, or after-school care which is <i>ad hoc<\/i> and does not have a defined structure.  Should we consider universal primary health care for all children or school book schemes?<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned the development in data which is very welcome.  I welcome her approach to ensuring that we have an evidence base for moving forward and that we understand why we are doing something.  Very often when I hear economists talk about demographics I shout at the radio &quot;That is birth rate&quot;.  We have an increasing birth rate but economists do not want to talk about that.  Too often children are forgotten in these issues.<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned Eurofound, the foundation based in Loughlinstown for the improvement of living and working conditions.  I recently visited the foundation.  It is doing some really interesting research on how parenting supports can best be delivered to children.  Ireland has the fourth highest rate in the EU of young people who are not in education, employment or training, the NEET category.  We do not want to be so high up on that list.  Schoolteachers and youth workers can point to those young people much earlier in the cycle.  That is where we should intervene.  Eurofound did research on the loss to the economy that jobseekers represent.  It calculated that they cost Ireland in the region of 2% of GDP which indicates that the cost of youth unemployment is &#8364;3.16 billion.  Those are the figures but it has been proved that if a young person lives in poverty he or she is likely to continue to be unemployed.  The pathway is laid.  It is important to intervene early and help to change those young people's lives.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has asked the youth work sector to investigate how we could intervene and best ensure that we do so.  We need to find the tipping point at which the young person ends up unemployed rather than going into education, training or employment and see how we can support those young people.<\/p><p>  I know that next week the Minister is hosting the EU Youth Conference on social inclusion.  It is significant that Ireland has chosen to host that conference under its Presidency and I was delighted to see that the Minister is doing so in co-operation with the European Commission, the European Youth Forum and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The European Youth Forum was born during the fifth Irish Presidency.  It held its inaugural meeting in Cork on 6 July 1996.  I was there.  I am a co-founder of the forum.  I was a secretary general of one the three youth platforms.  We came together to merge into one.  Two of the three secretaries general were Irish.  That is why I am so delighted to see them coming back to Dublin.<\/p><p>  I welcome the development of the child and family support agency and look forward to seeing the Bill.  I have made public my opinion of it to ensure that we debate this.  The new agency will have a budget of approximately &#8364;545 million for 2013 and at hearings held by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children last week we heard that approximately &#8364;100 million will go to NGOs and services.  When my opinion of the new agency was published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> I was surprised by the number of organisations which contacted me because they are afraid to speak publicly about this fearing that their funding will be cut.  There is a chilling effect.  We need to create an environment in which people can make constructive proposals to ensure that the agency works.  I know that the Minister does not intend this chilling effect but I was surprised by the number and types of organisations that came to me about this matter.<\/p><p>  I thank the Minister.  The statement she made to us today should be circulated to all Deputies and Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600033#GG00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1362582900,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister to the House.  Today is almost the anniversary of a similar debate which we held last year on 7 March.  I know it is common in business to schedule certain topics on board agendas on an annual basis for example, corporate governance or risk management.<\/p> <p>It is common in business to schedule certain topics such as corporate governance or risk management on board agendas on an annual basis and it is a good practice to take a similar approach in the world of politics, particularly in an area such as the one we are discussing.<\/p><p>In the debate on this area last year it was noted that \u20ac1.3 billion has been spent on the area of early childhood in the previous decade.  With respect to the current and previous Government, it is honest and fair to say that as the previous decade progressed our understanding improved considerably of the importance of early intervention in establishing outcomes for children, whether they be educational, health, welfare or child protection.  <\/p><p>This Government has made a particular commitment to Irish children with the appointment of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, with full responsibility to this position which is a full Cabinet post.  Putting the children's referendum to the Irish people was also an important step in recognising the importance of Irish children and our commitment to them.  Like many people, I wish the referendum had passed with a greater majority but I am conscious of the fact that the failure to overwhelmingly endorse the referendum signified a reluctance on the part of the Irish people and a concern about the failures of the State previously to protect children.  Unfortunately some of those failures were more recent.  I am thinking of the case of the family in Monageer who unfortunately took their own lives and it was made evident that there were many shortcomings in the social services in this country.<\/p><p>Like Senator Van Turnhout, I would like to congratulate the Minister on the document she circulated to us.  I agree with her it is an excellent document.  It should be circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas.  It is comprehensive and it is almost like an academic paper.  It comprehensively covers all of the bases and provides a strong justification for the importance of early intervention.<\/p><p>As someone who is passionately committed to equality in our society, there is no doubt in my mind that the measures that enshrine inequality in society are there at a very early stage of a child's life.  Children who come from families where there is high standard of education and a commitment to learning do better at school.  There is plenty of research to demonstrate that children in environments where parents read and where books are evident in the home perform better in an educational environment.  I was struck by the acknowledgment in the paper on early intervention that assistance to parents is very important, particularly to parents where there was not necessarily an environment of learning in their early lives.  It is also true to say that children who go to school properly nourished learn better and the evidence shows that the level of nutrition that children receive from birth, and even before birth, influences their brain growth and brain activity.  The life chances of children are determined from a very early stage and those life chances are deeply connected to social and economic inequality.  <\/p><p>I was struck by comments made by the former governor of Mountjoy Prison, John Lonergan, that the vast majority of the prison population came from a number of particularly deprived areas in Dublin which were easily identifiable.  Apart from the 2011 OECD report, in 2005 the National Economic and Social Forum published a report titled Early Childhood Care and Education and it stated that ability gaps open early and they persist and that this is true for other forms of verbal and mathematical ability as well as cognitive behaviour.<\/p><p>In 2002, research into the courts system in Ireland found that children in front of the courts were more likely to come from single-parent families, families with low incomes, families in consistent poverty, families where parents were long-term unemployed and families that were experiencing poor housing.  It is important that we do not lose sight of the fact that the outcomes that children have reflect the wider society in which they live.  It is true to say that we can intervene in very positive ways in those outcomes.  <\/p><p>I would like to pay tribute to the work of organisations such as Barnardos which intervenes in those types of communities to bring about positive outcomes and to research it has done which found that for every \u20ac1 spent in intervening in a child's life the State ultimately saves \u20ac8.  I also pay tribute to the work of Professor Pat Dolan, joint founder and director of UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre in NUI Galway, who estimates that there is evidence that for every \u20ac1 spent there is a \u20ac29 return to the State.<\/p><p>I also pay tribute to the work of the local area partnerships in tackling the scourge of poverty, of which children are the principal victims.  I highlight the work done by the Ballymun Partnership which works hand in hand with the local community not only to promote local job growth but to actively promote learning through projects such as the youngballymun initiative and so on.  With that in mind, I ask the Minister to be cautious in cutting youth services budgets, particularly those that have an enormous importance in deprived areas such as Blanchardstown, Ballymun, Darndale, Tallaght and other areas where a little money goes a long way in giving many young people a leg up at a critical point in their lives.<\/p><p>Aside from early intervention, and there is clear evidence it is of critical importance, that intervention must be effective.  I am conscious that in the four Dublin local authorities there is a spend of \u20ac29,000 for every homeless person in the region, and that is not including the amount that is raised in charitable donations.  However, research carried out by the Children's Research Centre in Trinity College shows that many young people who were interviewed for their research were known to the various agencies of the State, including child care agencies, youth homelessness services and the criminal justice system.  In spite of the engagements those young people had with the State in its various forms, we still had a situation where two out of every three children who had been in State care were homeless within two years of leaving a care setting.  Therefore, we must be cognisant that outcomes are not only related to the services that are available but to the quality of those services. <\/p><p>To echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Van Turnhout, I hope that the new child and family support agency fulfils all the hope that the Minister has for it and I hope that we will see the relevant legislation in early course.<\/p><p>It is clear that early intervention is a key critical issue not only in the area of education but in the areas of health and engagement with the criminal justice system but looking at the Heckman curve in the Minister's paper I was struck by the fact that it is clear that the earlier one intervenes in somebody's life the more effective that is.  I must emphasise that much of this is an outcome of poverty and social inclusion issues and we can never forget the wider picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600033#GG00300","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362583500,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, as always.  When she comes to this House everybody is stimulated by what she has to say to us.  We are looking at starting out with a new public service looking after the preschool group in a much more systematic way than we did previously.  We are trying to do it from the perspective of a country that is broke.  I think it was in articles in the <i>Sunday Business Post<\/i> last Sunday that some people wrote that the public servants should take the Croke Park offer because they were getting way more wages than they would get in Germany.  That is part of the background to the problems we face.  Through social partnership we have designed an extremely expensive public sector in terms of providing services.  That makes me cautious about embarking on another round.  We doubled the number of staff in the health service between 1985 and 2009 from 55,000 to 110,000 and the best efforts of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, have brought the number back to 103,000.  We must ask what on earth was happening with all that extra employment.  We hear dreadful numbers about the cost of children in care and so on raised at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.<\/p> <p>We have an extremely large number of people extremely highly-paid by international standards, making it difficult for us to tackle urgent problems such as the one under discussion this afternoon.  Being in favour of public expenditure may mean we end up with more highly-paid public servants.  On page 12 of the an bord snip nua report, it says the biggest increase has been at managerial and higher management level, with higher management levels in the public service growing by 82% in the period 1997 to 2009 when Civil Service numbers as a whole increased by 27%.  I get too much correspondence from deputy and area regional managers and too little from people on the ground helping in the tasks the Minister has illustrated.<\/p><p>Where would we get the money to pay for the proposal before us?  The other volume of the report examines special needs assistants, which went from 6,000 in 2004 and 2005 to 10,500 in 2009.  The budget grew from \u20ac130 million to \u20ac350 million.  Has anyone evaluated what was supposed to be happening?  Was it making life easier for teachers or were the results?  Are there any private sector firms in Ireland that employ 10,500 people?  We must ask these kinds of awkward questions and it does not mean the people asking the questions have formed a dislike of children or poor people.  They are just asking when this huge expenditure will bring results.<\/p><p>When we say we would like to shift child benefit, as per the Mangan report, more towards services we must ask what kind of services these are and what they would do.  We have a high level of cash transfers and the reasons there appear to be less results is the higher proportion of children in Ireland in jobless households.  I appreciate the Minister's studies of Scandinavia.  Dan O'Brien wrote an article about it and I know the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, is also concerned about it.  In the boom, we moved people from being potentially workers into the disability and invalidity categories in massive numbers.  Does that do children any favours?  There is some of that bias in the Mangan report in the way the lobby groups and the submissions were highly critical of the family income supplement.  What I like about it is that it gets resources to people who are working.  Work is the eventual solution.  I was concerned at the material in page 28 of the report, where they model the two-tier proposal.  Two thirds of parents on family income supplement would lose between \u20ac1 and \u20ac100 and less than 20% would gain between \u20ac1 and \u20ac50.  That seems an ill-advised route.  If we are to discredit cash as a means of helping low-income people, let us not do it in a way that disadvantages low-income workers.  Let us ensure the cash is turned into the benefits the Minister seeks and the Senators across the floor seek rather than more layers of bureaucracy.<\/p><p>What happened when we recruited an extra 4,500 special needs assistants in schools in a four-year period?  It must be one of the biggest recruitment programmes ever and I never hear it being evaluated.  There is no pot of gold and we cannot come into the House and say that, if there was a surplus in the budget, this is what we would like to spend it on.  There is no surplus.  We have spent a lot of money and we are bad at evaluating outcomes.  I agree with what Senator Van Turnhout described as the academic parts of the paper.  There seems to be conclusive evidence that early intervention is good.  If one was a devil's advocate or a contrarian, does that mean we should stop spending money on postdoctoral fellowships?  If people are still in university in their 30s, they might have grown up by that stage and we might like to give it to the three year olds about whom the Minister has been speaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600034#HH00200","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362584100,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600035#JJ00200","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1362584100,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Have we made child care too expensive by excessive regulation?

I compliment the Minister on the work she has done since taking office.  She has shown the way.  I compliment the way she has led her Department and it behoves all of the Government to get behind her in this most important portfolio.  It is the most important portfolio.  Many of the contributors have spoken about what it costs but we should be talking about what it saves and what the Minister can save the country by putting in place programmes she is working on.  I hope everyone is reading the reports produced by the Minister, listening and putting their backs behind the Minister to ensure it is not looked at as a cost Department but as a savings Department.<\/p><p>There is increasing evidence on this across the world, which has been there for many years in America and more recently in Ireland.  Various reports have been mentioned, including the profile of children at school, those of the Geary Institute, Professors Rutter, Scott and Perry and the Growing Up in Ireland survey.  I spent my life working with preschool, whether in lecturing or whatever.  Dr. Maria Montessori started off life in the slums of Italy and recognised that by getting children early in the prenatal and perinatal mothering period and also between the years of zero and three, there is a return to the state.  The children led the way and showed what they could do.  They brought home to their parents what they had learned.<\/p><p>The Minister's speech referred to the research undertaken and the sensitive period in the process of development, laying a foundation in childhood and beyond for cognitive functioning, behavioural, social and self-regulatory capacities.  Many children face various stresses during the years that can impair their healthy development.  Early childhood intervention programmes are designed to mitigate the factors that place children at risk of poor outcomes.  Such programmes provide support for the parents, children or family as a whole and the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is doing that.  The support may be in the form of learning activities or other structured experiences that affect the child directly or that have indirect effects such as training parents or otherwise enhancing caregiving environments.<\/p><p>As part of a recent study in America, 19 or 20 peer reviewed items of literature showed the effectiveness of early intervention.  Investing additional resources in early childhood education and the economic gains that accrue from it can overcome threats to healthy development such as resource disparities in early childhood.  It also addresses the consequences of those threats for educational outcomes and beyond.  Programmes that provide child development services from the prenatal period to the early intervention in school and preschool, scientific studies and sound evaluation are important.  A literature review identified 20 such programmes, and the findings about the outcome of the programmes in respect of 19 were favourable.  That is American research, which is more advanced than the Irish research but the Irish are catching up thanks to the Minister's commissioning of research.<\/p><p>I refer to family support, home visiting and service provision.  The Minister referred to bringing services into the classroom and child-centred environments.  This has been proven to be beneficial.  Programmes supplemented by parental education, delivered in the same settings and through home visits, have been found to be beneficial.  Early intervention programmes demonstrate significant and often sizeable benefits in the progression of educational attainment, health, delinquency and crime, social welfare, programme use and labour market success.  In some cases, the improved outcomes of these domains were demonstrated soon after the programme had ended.  In other cases, favourable impacts were observed through adolescence and into the transition to adulthood.  In the case of the Perry preschool programme, lasting benefits in a multiple domains have been measured for 35 years after the intervention ended.<\/p> <p>The Minister and other Members referred to the report on the savings made for the State, be it in the one to 16 or one to 26 year category.  The evidence indicates there can be longer lasting substantial gains.  The report should be circulated widely.  Parents of participating children can also gain from early intervention programmes.  Senator Jillian van Turnhout referred to the ratio of gross domestic product to youth unemployment.  Early intervention programmes would save more if they were introduced.  This strategy is in the Minister's good hands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600035#JJ00400","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362584700,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad to discuss this important topic, one that needs greater attention from all parties.  I share the Minister's support for greater levels of investment in early intervention programmes for children and her endorsement of universal services in this area.  With my Sinn F\u00e9in colleagues, I have long advocated that the State learn from the Nordic countries which have proved to be world leaders in the area.<\/p><p>While we have a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs who clearly understands the policy interventions needed to address issues of child poverty and a Government which proactively enshrined the rights of children into the Constitution, the Government is still implementing policies and budgets which are increasing the number of children in poverty and cutting vital funding from educational and youth services.  These cuts are having a detrimental impact on the well-being of children, particularly those in disadvantaged communities.  While I do not question the Minister's sincerity, I have to judge the commitment to improve the well-being of children, particularly those living in or at risk of poverty, on the Government's actions.<\/p><p>Figures show that 270,000 children in the State suffer some level of poverty, while the latest statistics from the Central Statistics Office show a further 35,000 children have fallen into poverty.  Yesterday Barnardos, the National Women's Council of Ireland, OPEN and Start Strong called for an additional investment of \u20ac2 billion in child care to benefit early development.  They argue this investment should target child care provision, child literacy and numeracy and increase the attendance of children from disadvantaged backgrounds in school, all of which would have benefits for the children involved, society and the economy.  We continue to underspend in this area.  Currently, we spend 0.25% of gross domestic product on preschool education, while in Denmark the figure is 1.3%.  At the same time, our child poverty rate is 11.4%, while in Denmark it is 5.4%.  Our higher level of poverty is not solely due to underinvestment in preschool education and early intervention, but there is still a relationship between the two.<\/p><p>The Minister asked whether it was realistic to talk about increased investment in early intervention in the current economic climate.  Senator Keane C\u00e1it has pointed to the savings such programmes can make for the State.  Countries which invest more in preschool education and early intervention have stronger economies and more stable and equal societies.<\/p><p>I have had many cases raised with me recently concerning the diagnosis and assessment of autism spectrum disorder.  The waiting list in Cavan stands at 25 months.  While families are waiting for an assessment, the children concerned cannot be offered resource teaching hours or home support help.  This flies in the face of the promise to provide for early intervention.  More cases are arising and I have many families coming to me where the child should be in first or second class but is still in junior infants.  They are not getting the supports they need because of the length of the waiting list for diagnosis.  If they seek a private psychological assessment, they are told it is not sufficient and that they must wait for an assessment by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, or the child and adolescent mental health services.  How is the Department of Children and Youth Affairs working with the Health Service Executive in dealing with this backlog and ensuring the children in question do not miss out on their education?  It will cost us more in the long run if we do not intervene now to help these children and ensure they receive these supports.  It is putting strain on children, their families and schools when they cannot access these resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600036#KK00200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1362584700,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and know she has a lot of interest in the topic of early intervention.<\/p><p>In 1240 Henry de Bracton, the English jurist, said, &quot;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&quot;  There have been numerous outstanding studies and reports written on the subject of early intervention and related matters.  The Start Strong document, The Economics of Children's Early Years, focused on the costs and benefits of early care and education in Ireland.  Of the amounts of public money spent on children and families, only 20% goes towards early childhood services for those aged 0-5 years, 37% for those in the middle years, six-11 years, and 44% for in the later years, 12-17 years.  Our spending on services for young children is weak by international standards, especially for the very youngest, as a large proportion of social expenditure on young children takes the form of cash benefits rather than services.<\/p><p>A report by Dr. Orla Doyle from University College Dublin's Geary Institute on early educational investment as an economic recovery strategy concluded there were high returns on early investment.  For every \u20ac1 invested, the State receives \u20ac29 back in benefits which include lower crime rates, less social intervention, better health and employment prospects.<\/p><p>As a parent, grandparent and athletics coach, I believe I am fully qualified to know the benefits of early intervention in the development of physical literacy and fundamental movement skills from a very young age.  These aid the development of literacy and numeracy skills, too.  I am at an advanced stage with the Department of Education and Skills in developing my Points for Life initiative which I hope will be introduced as a pilot scheme into primary schools in the coming year.  The aim of the programme is to develop physical literacy and fundamental movement skills in primary schoolchildren from a young age in order that they will have the competency and skills necessary to become active young people, be more likely to take part in sports activities and remain active throughout their lives.<\/p><p>While the Points for Life initiative is aimed at primary schools, these fundamental skills should be introduced to children from birth.  Parents and caregivers should be taught the importance of developing physical literacy skills.  They should also fully understand the benefits of having active young toddlers and children.  Teaching the fundamentals of physical literacy should be introduced in the preschool environment.  This is because the capacity for change decreases with age and it is more efficient, both biologically and economically, to get it right the first time rather than try to fix it later.  Exposure to high levels of physical stress early in life can affect the architecture of the developing brain.<\/p><p>The Canadian model, HOP, Healthy Opportunities for Preschoolers, has introduced several initiatives, together with guidelines for parents on developing physical literacy in children aged 0-12 years.  HOP is based on the belief all children benefit from daily physical activity that promotes health-related fitness and movement skills.  It is important that individuals responsible for the well-being of preschool children are aware of the value of physical activity and help to facilitate each child's movement experiences.<\/p> <p>More and more children are spending time in the care of others.  A care environment in which caregivers can play an active role can positively shape children's futures and is an ideal place for most physical activity to take place.<\/p><p>The recent report, Growing Up in Ireland, produced some startling findings, among them that 26% of nine year olds were found to have a body mass index outside the healthy range, of whom 19% were defined as obese.  The very young are remarkably eager to learn and we can start to teach fundamental movement skills from a young age, literally from birth through to six years.  This could lay the foundations for future success in developing these skills.<\/p><p>Starting the process at young preschool ages enhances the development of brain function, co-ordination, social skills, motor skills, emotional development, leadership and imagination.  It also helps children to build confidence and develop positive self-esteem.  Needless to say, it also helps to build strong bones and muscles, improve flexibility, develop good posture, improve fitness, promote a healthy body weight and reduce stress.  I realise I am under constraints of time, but I believe in the benefits of this approach having seen my children and grandchildren develop basic motor and movement skills at a young age and how advanced they have become as young adults and adults.  It starts from the ground up and starting this work at preschool stage is an important way of advancing all of these health-related issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600036#KK00300","speaker":"1165","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362585300,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish her a happy international women's week.  There are two women at the Cabinet table and 12 men.  We have the evidence.  The Minister has the dynamism, vision and ambition required.  Is the work of the Government not based on evidence?  Is evidence not important in formulating policy?  Everyone should get a copy of the Minister's speech.  She has demonstrated the necessary ambition and evidence gathering skills for a long period.  She is aware of new evidence and how critical it is.<\/p><p>In preparing my remarks I examined the Department's overall strategy and mission statement which refers to leading the effort to improve outcomes for children and young people.  The Minister is well aware of the long list of things the Department must do to implement the strategy.  Everything on the list has been either completed or the Minister has begun to do work on it.  Her speech demonstrates her mastery of the detail, for which I commend her.  However, her desire to develop, implement and, presumably, lead the national early years strategy has the potential to become her greatest legacy.  Some of the strategy is built on the work of the previous Government and it is wonderful to see this seamless commitment, as Senator Terry Leyden noted.  The Minister is now in place and the champion of the cultural shift in our public programmes of prevention and early intervention for children.  She is aware of and referred to the bias in favour of policies that support later intervention, which is expensive and ineffective too.  It is critical to address this issue and I commend and support the Minister for her efforts.<\/p><p>I have two questions on the early years strategy.  I hope it is not too presumptuous to think the Minister might say &quot;Yes&quot; in response to my first question.  Will the strategy contain a commitment to invest in the services which prevention and early intervention sites have demonstrated to work in Irish settings?  The Minister has identified many of the evaluations and, as she has stated previously, some things did not work.  However others are working and I hope to see in the strategy a commitment to begin to implement and invest, not necessarily in every site in Ireland, but in those that have been demonstrated to work.  Will the strategy name the systems to be developed to enable schools, the new agency to be established by the Minister, community, voluntary and private providers of children's services, parents and children to work together in an integrated fashion?  I hope to see in it a development and a naming of the systems, not only the ways of working, that need to change to develop that integration.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to another issue, also raised by a number of Senators, that is, the Mangan report.  We are aware of budgetary decisions made prior to publication of the report.  There are issues of cash versus services or perhaps cash plus services.  Senator Sean D. Barrett spoke at length about this issue and I agree with much of his commentary.  As the Minister is aware, the next part of the Mangan report will consider in-work benefits for lower income families.  That will be important information for us to ensure the reform of child income supports is implemented but to ensure, at the same time, that there is an incentive for people to stay in employment.  Will the Minister consider the possibility that we may need an examination of the idea of cash plus services?  This picks up on something to which Senator Sean D. Barrett referred.  We need to investigate the amounts of money available in child income support and the types of services that could be matched with it to produce the best outcomes in different environments.  I have put it to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and now put it to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs that they both have the moral authority to seek reform without further savings in child income supports.  I support them in this regard.<\/p><p>My final point relates to economic issues.  The Minister quoted and identified research into the benefits and costs of the early years strategy.  Other Senators have referred to this aspect also.  Many of the data arise from first generation research.  I am not referring to research in Ireland but to the work of Mr. Jim Heckman whom I met when we were setting out to work on the prevention and early intervention sites eventually presented.  Now, second generation research is coming through.  Will the Minister consider the possibility of investigating new and innovative approaches to estimate the cost and benefits of interventions and services to build on the data from the earlier period?  New econometric models are being developed to estimate the benefits and costs to local and central government to inform Government decisions on early interventions.  An evidence base for investment holds considerable potential to assist strategic decision making on competing policies and programmes.  We only have so much money available and can only fund certain things.  New research is emerging based on these econometric models which can help us to carefully select investments that could make a significant difference not only to the outcomes for children but to the public purse also.<\/p><p>The renowned Washington State Institute for Public Policy has created a model for the United States and my colleague, Professor Michael Little, from Darlington in the United Kingdom is working with the institute to create a model for Europe.  They are developing a way to estimate the cost of a particular service, for example, a reading programme or a reduction in class size and the economic benefits to the child, the local agency and the state.  They provide an analysis which suggests policy options for the Legislature.  The institute informed the early learning strategy of the governor of the State of Washington, whom the Minister met with me some time back when that state produced the ground-breaking early years strategy.  Since Ireland is setting out to publish its first national early years strategy, this could be a prime opportunity to take the lead throughout Europe to develop a model for current and future legislators in order that we can improve outcomes for children with smart, targeted and modest sums of investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600037#LL00800","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1362585300,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister back to the House and commend her for her ongoing work in this area.  There is a large body of international research.  I do not wish to rehash what everyone has said because we are all singing from the same hymn sheet.  We all recognise the importance of investing in early childhood care and education and that this makes economic sense in the long run.  Child poverty is a growing concern, with the rate currently standing at 19.7%.  We know that growing up in such an environment has a long-lasting effect on children and the effects often persist from one generation to the next.<\/p> <p>Early care and education can help to reduce child poverty.  It will have a beneficial effect on the child's development, allowing them to engage as fully as possible in the education system and to reach their potential so they can enter the workforce and secure a rewarding and well-paid job.  Where child care is affordable and accessible, it enables parents to access employment, education and training which will improve the situation of both parents and children.<\/p><p>The recent publication of the Mangan report has given us reasons to focus on some relevant points regarding child poverty.  Ireland is the only OECD country with an above average child-cash benefit transfer but an average child poverty rate.  On the other hand, Denmark, Iceland, France and Spain spend twice as much on their services, including early care and education, as on income supports.  Their child poverty rates are between one third and two thirds of the OECD average.  In monetary terms, we appear to be spending much money on our children but are not getting the outcomes we should.<\/p><p>Child care in Ireland remains a significant cost for families.  Among OECD countries, we are second only to Switzerland for child care costs.  A recent survey by Barnardos, the National Women's Council of Ireland, OPEN and Start Strong showed that these costs are having a serious effect on household budgets and on the ability of parents to take up employment.  The provision of the free preschool year for all children has been a great development with 60,000 children availing of the scheme.  The Minister is working towards the provision of a second free preschool year for all children, which I welcome.  The recently published statistics on child poverty and child care costs emphasise the need for this second year.<\/p><p>My first experience with early intervention was with my 15 year old son when he was three years of age.  At the time we were not aware that he had an intellectual disability.  We were told then we needed to attend an early intervention parenting course.  I reluctantly dragged my husband with me where for eight weeks we were told about OWL, observing, watching and listening to our child.  At the time I noticed that all the children on this programme had intellectual disabilities.  When I asked my husband did he think our son had one, he said not at all.  We thought every parent was brought along to these sessions.<\/p><p>Eventually, when our son was diagnosed and required early intervention for speech therapy, I believed he was going to have a great life ahead.  However, when he reached four years of age, we had to take him for a private psychological assessment because the waiting lists were long.  We were also told to enrol him at a different service provider for his education because of his abilities.  I received a telephone call at work to tell me he did not qualify for any more early intervention because he was attending that service.  The problem was the service provider did not have the therapy programmes we needed.  For the next 13 years, he did not receive speech or physiotherapy services.  Some are lucky that they can afford to pay for private services.  I see parents spending every cent of their children's allowance and other care grants to provide private physiotherapy for their children.<\/p><p>On the recommendation of a psychological report last year, we changed our son's school.  Once again, he was eligible for various interventions.  I thought this was brilliant and that we would get the services we should have got when he was three.  Within a month he was assessed for physiotherapy and occupational therapy.  Unfortunately, he has spent the last several months in a wheelchair which could have been avoided if he had access to these services at three years of age.  As well as this, when he was assessed, we were informed there was a year and a half long waiting list for the services.  By then, he will be 17 and over age for child services so he will have to access adult services.  Again, he will slip through the net.  On top of all this, both therapists, who are excellent, went off on maternity leave at the same time and were not replaced for the whole year.  Why is someone denied physiotherapy or speech therapy because the therapist is out on maternity leave?  I understand priority cases were dealt with but to every mother her child is a priority.  The services should be in place for everyone.<\/p><p>Early intervention sounds wonderful.  Through my personal example, I hope I have shown how when it comes down to the nitty-gritty many people can fall through the net.  There is much to be done in the area of disability and I would welcome the opportunity to meet with the Minister to discuss it further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600037#LL00900","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362585900,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to the Seanad and, like others have said, I know she has her finger on the pulse when it comes to the importance of investing in early intervention in child care and learning.  Many other Members spoke about the studies that support investment in this area.  The Minister will recall when she was in the Seanad in 2011, I did a study on early school-leaving.  One key conclusion to reduce early school-leaving was to invest in the early years zero to seven age group.  Another conclusion was to set up a special Department with a focus on this area which this Government has done.<\/p><p>All the evidence points to the benefits we can gain from early intervention.  When we ask how we can reduce crime and impact on challenging behaviours such as autism, ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, early school-leaving and unemployment, all of the evidence points to investing early in child care.  As part of my study, I visited Mountjoy Prison with John Lonergan who identified two male and two female prisoners for me to interview.  What struck me was so many of our inmates have ADHD but it is not understood.  As well as providing for the early years, we must provide for the carers and educators to be trained to deal with the symptoms of challenging behaviour from children in their early years.  I was a primary school teacher myself.<\/p> <p>I worked with infants from four to seven years of age for a number of years both here and abroad, and I also worked in teacher education.  I suggest it is critical for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to link in with the Minister for Education and Skills and with the teacher education colleges so that the early years strategy is understood and the privileged role those working with young children have in identifying behaviours and ways of assisting is noticed and developed.  There is evidence to support this suggestion.  In her paper on the role of early childhood education and care, Noreen Hayes talks about evidence from countries with low levels of child poverty.  She suggests more success is experienced when macroeconomic and social policies are closely aligned and when there is an integrated approach that places children at the centre of child poverty strategies.  We are familiar with this approach and we always speak about child-centred policy.  I found it interesting to read in her paper that Sweden's per capita GDP is lower than that of the US and comparable to that of the UK, yet comparisons of child poverty show that of the countries surveyed, the US has the second highest level, the UK has the fourth highest level and Sweden has the lowest level.  <\/p><p>We must look at the countries that are succeeding in this area.  I like the recommendation made by Ms Hayes that we move away from targeted measures and towards a universal early childhood education and care policy, such as the early childhood care and education scheme.  We are aware that subsidising early childhood services will make them more accessible and affordable for poorer families, but in the context of the times we are in and in the context of the squeezed middle, we need universal services more than ever.  Last week, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, was here in the House, and we know there is talk of reducing child benefit.  However, I strongly recommended to her that the moneys saved should be put into structures that will benefit everybody.  It should not just go towards providing an extra \u20ac35 to individuals.  How much of a difference can a person make to his or her life in a week with \u20ac35 compared to having free access to early childhood care or after-school care?  Youth centres and creative centres for young people should also be supported.<\/p><p>I would appreciate an indication from the Chair when I have one minute left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600038#MM00200","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362586500,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The Senator is actually a minute over time.

To sum up, the evidence supports the Minister and she is on the right track.  However, throughout the country we have better provision in some areas than others, particularly with regard to developing the creativity of young people.  For example, in Dublin we have the Ark, the creative writing centre Fighting Words, and Imaginosity, and in Limerick we have the Learning Hub.  These provide a parallel creative system for children that the education system does not always develop.  I ask the Minister to be open to proposals in this area.  I am developing a proposal currently for a young creator centre that will help children develop their creativity, particularly at second level, in an exam-based system that often beats the creativity out of them.  I am knocking our second level system, but suggesting we need more, because our young people are our future and the more we invest in them, the stronger the nation we will have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600039#NN00300","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1362586500,"counter":265,"content":"<p>At this stage of the debate, everybody has said everything one would wish to say.  We are all singing from the same hymn sheet and there is no need to repeat what has been said.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  She always has a smile on her face, has been a fantastic Minister and has worked very hard on behalf of our children.  I thank her for that.<\/p><p>  Nobody can overestimate the importance of early intervention, which is vital for our children.  I have come across a number of adults who cannot read or write, which is very sad in this day and age.  The reason is that when they were young and in school, there was no help for them.  Unfortunately, because they were that bit slower or could not keep up with the rest, they were put to the back of the class and left there.  As a result, they did not learn to read or write.  This situation shows the importance of early intervention; their situation could have been avoided had the services been available.<\/p><p>  I particularly wanted to speak in this debate about the HSE services plan.  We got a briefing on our HSE services plan in Kerry last Monday.  In discussing that plan we spoke about the reconfiguration of children's disability therapy services.  I am not speaking against the plan, but it proposes to amalgamate the Brothers of Charity and Enable Ireland and other services and to have them all working from the one centre.  However, no extra resources are to be provided.  It is proposed to bring into the net all those children who are left out and not getting the services currently and to expand and grow on that.  This is great news and hopefully it will happen.  However, I am concerned that the services for existing children will be diminished due to the fact that no extra resources are to be provided.<\/p><p>  The Brothers of Charity in Killarney also run a fantastic preschool for children with all sorts of disabilities.  The benefits to the children who go through that preschool are untold, as is the work put in by those working there.  However, the facility is not set up to take any older children with wheelchairs.  I believe this will be a problem in the long run.  I would welcome the Minister's opinion on this and on whether we will be able to put more resources into this campaign.  Otherwise, what is there for the children currently will be reduced.  The staff will remain at the same level, but if more children come into the system, the staff will have to spread themselves more thinly on the ground.<\/p><p>  Senator Zappone spoke about cashflow services schemes.  Today, at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, a presentation was given on poverty in Ireland and we were told of the significant number of children encountering poverty in Ireland.  Yesterday, I spoke on the Order of Business about the mobility allowance, which is to be abolished in four months' time, although I understand we are considering an alternative scheme.  One cannot underestimate the value of a monetary payment to these people.  It allows them to provide their own transport to take their children in wheelchairs to early intervention services, to speech and language therapy and whatever other services they need.  It is not always so easy to have a bus or van, such as a Vantastic van, <i>in situ<\/i> to transport children at the right time.  It is all about timing.  How can we tell these people they must be at a certain place at 3 p.m. or 11 a.m.?  This will not work in rural Ireland.  The best solution is for parents to continue doing what they are doing by providing their own transport and using the mobility allowance to maintain and buy vehicles in which they can transport their children.  I understand this issue does not come within this Minister's remit but, as Senator Zappone said, one cannot beat having a woman at the Cabinet table.  Perhaps it is sexist to say that.  However, I know how women react to the position of children with disabilities and I hope the Minister will put a good case forward for maintaining a monetary payment for people providing transport for children, particularly those with disabilities, to enable them to continue availing of the services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600039#NN00400","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1362587100,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their wide range of statements on the future of early intervention.  There is a widely shared view that a new emphasis on early intervention is needed as a matter of critical importance.  Senator Barrett and others reminded us that this discussion is taking place in a difficult economic context.  There was a shared focus on the part of a number of speakers on the importance of effective intervention.  Money used to be thrown at interventions in a variety of ways without any evaluation of their effectiveness.  I think the point is that we need to examine what is the most effective intervention.  It is clear from studies that have been done in Dublin that some interventions do not work as well as others.<\/p><p>While I accept that we have to make sure we move towards a more research-based emphasis on intervention, I do not think everything can be measured.  Senator Leyden spoke about the value of having a happy childhood and being loved.  Clearly, the quality of love and affection given to children - these are basic things every child needs - is not something that can be subjected to a strict measurement.  There is overwhelming evidence that if we do not invest more in early intervention, the cost in terms of the poor prognosis for the children who do not benefit from it will be quite high.<\/p><p>A number of Senators spoke about the issue of disability, for which the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is responsible.  Of course the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has a role to play in this regard.  We are working closely with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Special Education to improve the provision of supports throughout the continuum of a child's life.  As Senator Moran pointed out, we need to ensure the transitions work better for children with disabilities.  It is appalling that when some children move from one service to another, they almost have to start at the end of the queue in order to have direct supports provided to them.  We need much more integration than that.  It should not be happening.  It is disturbing to hear the stories we have heard today about disability services in the early years.  It highlights how much we need to do in this area to ensure services are provided as early as they are needed.  They should not be always provided on the basis of diagnosis.  We want to see services provided throughout the early years.<\/p><p>Senator Reilly mentioned the waiting list in Cavan.  Obviously, it is totally damaging for a child who is on the autism spectrum to have to wait 25 months.  If the Senator sends me details of the cases in question, I will take them up with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  We will examine precisely what is happening.  A number of other Senators, including Senator Moloney, expressed concern about the provision of disability services.  There is room for more cross-departmental work in this regard.  I assure the House that these matters are being examined.  Detailed interdepartmental work is being done to improve the situation.  There is no question about the fact that it is very urgent.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout asked about the allocation of grants to non-governmental organisations.  The reality is that the circumstances of those organisations will not change.  There is approximately \u20ac100 million in the budget for non-governmental organisations.  Following the establishment of the new child and family agency, there will be greater co-ordination between the work of the organisations being funded and the priorities of the agency and the Government.  I think that is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600040#OO00100","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1362587100,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Yes, absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600040#OO00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1362587100,"counter":268,"content":"<p>We need more integration and more co-ordination.  I am aware of a particular town where a variety of services are not in contact with each other or even aware of each other's existence.  I have had several such experiences in the past two years.  It was clear from the child death report, which mentioned a family that was dealt with by 14 different agencies, that there is a need for co-ordination.  I do not think there is a need for any kind of \"chilling effect\" on these organisations.  We want a good partnership between the organisations we are funding and the priorities of the new agency.  That is the reality of the current situation.  It is the right thing to do as well.  There is no need for concern.  The new reality involves more co-ordination and more engagement between statutory and voluntary bodies.  The goal of the new agency is to facilitate such integration.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden spoke about parenting and about the past failures of the State.  Her point about the need for more engagement with parents is important in the context of early intervention.  It is increasingly emerging from the studies that we need to work with families and parents, rather than merely taking the children for a number of hours each day or week.  There is scope for us to do more work with parents than we are doing at present.  It would be good to see more parental engagement in the course of the universal preschool year.  That involves the provision of resources, staff time and training.  It is happening but it is not as universal as I would like it to be.  Many of our centres are working very well with parents. A substantial number of parenting courses are taking place throughout the country.  The Senator also mentioned the cutbacks in youth funding.  I want to try to preserve front-line services.  There has been some misunderstanding about the amounts that are involved.  I am in discussions with the youth organisations, including the City of Dublin Youth Services Board, on the matter.<\/p><p>I agree with the other points that were made about trying to keep the focus on the front line.  A number of Senators, including Senator Barrett, asked whether there should be a focus on direct cash payments or on early investment.  Some speakers suggested we should focus on both.  We need to have a discussion on this matter.  Ideally, one would do both.  A number of Senators mentioned the child poverty statistics in this context.  The current rate of absolute poverty is approximately 9.5% and the current rate of consistent poverty is approximately 18.9%.  We will publish some research on this tomorrow.  As far as the Government is concerned, the best way to help these families is to create jobs.  The best way out of poverty is to be able to access work and employment.  That is why we have to keep a focus on job creation.  International evidence suggests that the kind of investment in early childhood about which we are talking today is a great support to the families which are most at risk.<\/p><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan spoke about the need to work with preschools on physical activity.  It is a very good point.  We need to think about the quality of the experiences of children who have been in these services for a year or two.  I refer to their experiences at every level, including emotionally and physically.  There is a need for us to consider the kinds of interventions we are making.<\/p><p>Senator Zappone asked about the increasing use of the more sophisticated evidence base that is coming from Washington, for example.  I mentioned the research work that has been done there.  I believe we should move in that direction.  I am a big fan of that kind of research because it is the best way to convince all areas of government.  It needs to be much more integrated into our budgetary strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600040#OO00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1362587100,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600040#OO00400","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1362587100,"counter":270,"content":"<p>That is why today's debate is really important.  We need much greater public awareness and policy awareness about the kind of research that is emerging and can save Governments money.  It is clear that if we work with young children, particularly those who are most at risk, in an effective manner, they will not go down the path of getting into trouble with addictions or dropping out of school, a problem that was mentioned by Senator Healy Eames.  While this research is very convincing, it is difficult at a time of economic challenge to put in place the resources in that would make a difference to such children.  If we do not provide those resources, however, the cost to the children in question will be much greater.  As Senator Keane said, there are savings to be made if we approach this in the right way.  I think that is the message from today.<\/p><p>I welcome this debate.  We need to continue it, particularly in the context of the budgetary discussions later in the year.  We must ascertain how we can move towards the kinds of services we need and how we can get the funding for them.  Obviously, that will have to be done on an incremental basis.<\/p> <p>It does need to be rigorously evaluated, but it is possible for us to identify immediately the quality aspects we need to improve in the provision of early years education.  With a relatively little financial input, we could make quite a difference to the outcomes for vulnerable children.  Equally, we have the debate about whether something should be universal or selective.  I was very pleased to be able to maintain the universal aspect, as Senator Terry Leyden noted, of the preschool year.  The ideal would be to have a second preschool year.  There would be staff training issues connected to this, as well as quality issues which the early years strategy group is examining.  <\/p><p>Senator Katherine Zappone asked me about whether the early years strategy would be able to suggest a model for the services integrating and working well together.  The best place for that to be happen would be through the Child and Family Support Agency.  The agency will be examining the linkages needed between the early years sector and services under the agency in the same way as we need to integrate youth services.  We need a seamless integration of all of these services.  There has been fragmentation.  Parents and early years services can be helped by working with the Child and Family Support Agency which I am sure will address that issue when the report is finalised around June or July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600040#OO00500","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Seanad Electoral Reform Bill 2013: Order for Second Stage","time":1362587700,"counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600041#PP00200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1362587700,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Bill entitled an Act to provide for free and fair elections to Seanad \u00c9ireann wherein the franchise is extended to all people who are over eighteen and legally in resident in Ireland and to all people who are Irish citizens; to alter the method that graduates of an Irish Institute of Higher Education use to elect members of the\r\nSeanad; to provide for the conduct of elections to Seanad \u00c9ireann and to amend the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Acts 1937 to 2006, the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Acts 1947 to 2006; to amend the Electoral Acts 1992 to 2012; to amend the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 1938 and to provide for related matters.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1362587700,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I move: \"That Second Stage be taken now.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600041#PP00400","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1362587700,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Seanad Electoral Reform Bill 2013: Second Stage","time":1362587700,"counter":276,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600041#PP00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1362587700,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<br \/>I am not advancing this Bill because I wish to preserve the Seanad in the face of extinction by way of referendum; rather, I advance it because I wish to offer something better and something we have never had, namely, a truly democratic Chamber that would draw the citizens of the Republic closer to the heart of the parliamentary process.

That involves keeping this undemocratic and dysfunctional Upper Chamber or abolishing it completely.  Most citizens to whom I speak would like a third choice - reform.  If Members allow this Bill to pass Second Stage, there will be a viable alternative which can be amended on Committee Stage to be presented at the time of the referendum.  We will be giving the people a choice.<\/p><p>  While the democratic deficit at the heart of the Seanad was my principal motive in campaigning for change, other compelling reasons for reform have been become clearer to me in the two years since I was honoured with election.  In short, not only is the Seanad, as constituted, undemocratic, it is also ineffective.  What are the problems?  In the first instance, it is clear that Parliament collectively consistently fails in its duty to hold the Executive branch of government to account.  The recent economic meltdown provides the best example of the consequences of this political failure.  It has long been my position that the principal responsibility for the collapse does not lie on the shoulders of the bankers or real estate developers whose actions, while generally irresponsible and sometimes unethical, were, however, rational exercises of financial self-interest.<\/p> <p>Elected parliamentarians and Ministers and the professional regulators who were appointed by and answered to them failed to exercise their responsibility to rein in the excesses of these sectors.  This was sometimes due to unhealthily close connections between politicians and those in the banking and building sectors.  More often, however, it was less sinister in nature and was due to either a lack of economic expertise or, in the case of some of the more financially literate Members of Parliament, the silencing effect of the party whip.<\/p><p> This failure is not some theoretical abstraction, it has real and tragic consequences.  Some 100,000 of our children emigrate each year as a result of bad governance and poor and inadequate Oireachtas oversight of the activities of Government.  Others are languishing on hospital trolleys or waiting lists or have had their social supports withdrawn.  How could parliamentary reform have prevented these problems?  How could the expertise of parliamentarians been used to overcome bureaucratic inertia and stasis?  If good, innovative and well-thought-out legislation such as the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill 2012, which was put forward by Senator Colm Burke and which was designed to address an important but, in scope, limited problem, cannot even traverse the whip system because civil servants did not approve of it, how can parliamentary oversight of the actions of Ministers and officials in the macroeconomic sphere ever succeed?<\/p><p> The Seanad Electoral Reform Bill 2013 is primarily a pragmatic attempt to democratise the Seanad within the constraints of Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann.  While I firmly believe that our Constitution requires far-reaching change - particularly in so far as it pertains to both Houses and to the way in which Ministers are appointed to Government - I accept that we in this House are not able to effect such change.  To believe otherwise is fantasy.  We must work within the Constitution and this means that certain things are constitutionally non-negotiable.  In the first instance, the Taoiseach retains his right to nominate 11 Members of this House.  We cannot touch this right without amending the Constitution.  It is a little undemocratic but it is not entirely unprecedented internationally.  In Italy, bonus seats are given to the most successful party in elections.  This can combat gridlock and - as has abundantly been the case in the current Seanad - allows for other, non-political expertise to be introduced into the corridors of Parliament.  In the second instance, the panels, including the university panels, cannot be abolished.  Finally, the vote must be postal.<\/p><p> The Bill addresses the democratic deficit definitively.  We propose that all electors - in Seanad elections these people will be defined as all citizens of our Republic and also those who are legally resident within the jurisdiction of the Republic and who already allowed to vote in local elections - will have the opportunity to vote in respect of one panel.  When they present themselves at polling stations on the day of a general election, these individuals will be given a D\u00e1il ballot paper and also one Seanad electoral panel ballot paper of their choice.<\/p><p> The old university panels posed something of a challenge to us in framing this legislation.  The elitist limitation of voting rights to graduates generally but even more so to the graduates of only two universities, namely, Trinity College and the National University of Ireland, NUI, has been a frequent and appropriate source of criticism of the current Seanad.  I am the first member of my family who would have had a vote in Seanad elections.  I include in that my grand-uncles, who served time in Frongoch and Pentonville, as guests of his then Majesty, for their role in our struggle for independence.  The seventh amendment to Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann allowed for the extension of this right to other graduates.  However, that amendment was never legislated for nor acted upon.  The Bill before the House provides the long overdue legislative correction to extend voting rights to three smaller, two-seat legislative constituencies.  Those outside who are looking at this debate and who may think the Bill an exercise in self-preservation should note that in this dispensation I would not have been elected to the Seanad because I came third in the three-seat constituency and Senators Mullen and Quinn would, therefore, have been the sole NUI representatives.<\/p><p> Under the Bill, the nomination process would be thoroughly democratised.  Any citizen of our Republic would be eligible to stand for any panel, although nominations to the third-level panels would be constitutionally limited to graduates of the relevant institutions.  Nomination would require the signed agreement of 1,000 citizens.  Thus, the filtering effect of the parties and of the rather bizarre nominating bodies system would be ended.  The people would nominate and the people would elect.  No one else would be involved.  It is simple.<\/p><p> Two other provisions of the Bill have been flagged by some as being controversial.  These are the extension of the franchise to Irish citizens abroad and the enfranchisement of non-citizens who are legally resident in our Republic.  With respect to voting rights for Irish citizens abroad, it should be noted that this is not some radical, internationally unprecedented departure.  A total of 115 countries recognise such rights for their citizens.  The countries to which I refer include the United States and many of our EU neighbours.  In the case of countries such as the US, citizens living abroad have absolutely full voting rights.  In the case of other countries such as Italy, limitations apply and citizens living abroad are only able to cast their votes in respect of a number of seats.  It must be remembered that if the Bill were accepted, we would be joining the ranks of the limited.  The proposal is, therefore, not that radical.  We are only extending voting rights to Seanad elections, not to D\u00e1il or Presidential elections.  Disquiet to the effect that this is representation without taxation has been expressed.  The actions of successive Oireachtais have ensured that not only have many citizens here lost the right to pay taxes because they lost their jobs but also that hundreds of thousands of others who would love to work and pay taxes right here in this Republic have had that opportunity dashed from their hands as a result of forced emigration.  Denying them the right to vote would be absurd.<\/p><p> There is also concern that our domestic politics might somehow be malfeasantly subverted by the highly organised and orchestrated registration of large numbers of tenuously Irish, passport-eligible Americans or others.  This is not really plausible.  Not only would possession of a passport be necessary, formal registration on the register of electors at any embassy or consular office would also be required.  In addition, the arithmetic does not stack up.  In large national panels, the effects of such manipulation would, in truth, be minimal.  Similarly, the Bill extends the right to legally resident non-Irish citizens who live in the Republic.  This is not as controversial as has been portrayed because these residents - and contributors to our society - are already registered and recognised as electors in local elections.  As such, they already contribute indirectly to the election of 43 Senators who are elected to this House by the local representatives for whom these residents can vote.<\/p><p> Why should colleagues vote for the Bill?  The principal reason is that there has been widespread and long-held near unanimity that the Seanad <i>status quo<\/i>is not acceptable.  The latter is mainly due to the democratic deficit which lies at the core of an institution that was deliberately crafted by its creators to minimise the input of ordinary citizens.  Thus, it is not only functionally undemocratic but it is also, at its core, philosophically undemocratic.  Nothing could illustrate this dysfunction better than the discordance between the overwhelming support I have received on a personal level from most Senators in recent days in respect of the Bill and the real possibility that they may be constrained from voting for something they actually believe would benefit our country.<\/p><p> Many people have asked me about the brains behind the drafting of this legislation.  In that context, Shane Conneely deserves the bulk of the credit because he has worked tirelessly on the Bill in recent weeks and months.  He was assisted in his work by a young law student, Aoife Casey, who is present in the Gallery.  We also received research support from Aoife O'Toole and Eibhlin Mullarney.  Those to whom I refer form the coalition of mostly unpaid interns who work as my assistants.  I thank them for their work.  I also wish to thank the Minister for his attention and I look forward to his acceptance of this democracy-enhancing Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600041#PP00700","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362588300,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Senator Crown, on this very professionally drafted Bill.  When I read it, I suspected that fine legal minds were behind its production.  I am glad the Senator referred to the work done by those to whom he referred because when he used the word \"We\" in framing the Bill, I was afraid people might have thought I was involved in its drafting.  Although I would have taken great pride from such involvement, the legislation which emerged might have been slightly different.<\/p><p>It is important that we should take the Bill as a first step and that we should use it to move on.  Last week I indicated to the Minister that it is quite possible to have a Seanad Bill which can then be amended.  The Government acted like a dog in the manger, however, removed the relevant legislation and stated that it had something better to offer.  After all, the differences involved were distinctly marginal.  The differences are not marginal with the Government or, indeed, with the Minister, Deputy Hogan, whose views on the matter are fairly widely well known.  There is a huge amount of prejudice in respect of this matter.  The Government has prejudged it and in an act of quite extraordinary political cynicism - and for no other reason - the Taoiseach of this country has decided to offer up this second Chamber of the Oireachtas as a blood sacrifice in respect of the follies and mistakes of the Lower House.<\/p> <p>I remind the Minister that we had nothing to do with the parlous situation into which this country was dragged by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, despite the warnings from myself and many other people in this Chamber that the country was going down the road to ruin.  It is cynical and hypocritical.  It is an indication of the standard of morals which the Minister's Government has that he would purport this to be a reform to abolish Seanad \u00c9ireann.  He knows perfectly well because he has been around this place a long time, that there has been report after report.  I have spent 25 years since I was elected trying to get this House reformed because good though it is, it could be better.  It was corrupted, deliberately and specifically by the Minister's party, by the Labour Party and by Fianna F\u00e1il, in their own small-minded interests.  I well remember the days when the Minister's party and the rest of them used to stand over the Senators and tell them what names to mark so do not talk to me about the corruption or the removal from reality of Seanad \u00c9ireann because the finger prints of every Government are all over it.<\/p><p> Time after time, I have sat on committees to reform the Seanad.  All-party groups have signed up to them and time and time again, including this very session of Seanad \u00c9ireann, I have tabled, as the first item under my name, the passage of those very proposals for reform that all the Government parties agreed.  How much hypocrisy are the Irish people expected to take?  I want an assurance that there will be fairness and truth in the referendum and the Referendum Commission because the Government has a bad record on that one.  I do not want to hear any lies or any false statements.  Perhaps leading members of the Government are almost as innumerate as I am but that does not excuse the untruths they told about the cost of this House.<\/p><p> I commend Senator Crown because he has proposed a root and branch reform.  I think it splendid that we involve people outside this country, our own emigrants, who were left out by the political circumstances.  That is something that needs to be done and it is commendable.  People should be able to vote from abroad.  I accept that rationalisation of the university seats is long overdue but they must be kept.  I will defend them to the death because I am fed up and tired of what people say about them.  Another bleary-eyed academic in today's newspaper says that it impugns the democracy, that we are the least democratic seats.  We are the most democratic.  I have an electorate of 65,000 and I think Senator Crown has 120,000.  It is a bit better than the 227 who voted in the last by-election on the panel system.  I am not impugning any of the Members.  In fact, I think the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, owes an apology to the marvellous people, the wonderful and most stellar group of Taoiseach's nominees who have ever graced this House.  To deride this House as corrupt and rubbish in that way is an insult to those Members, all of whom have performed brilliantly.  They are the best I have ever come across in this entire House.  What an insult was paid to them.<\/p><p> We need an efficient Seanad and no hypocrisy.  We should not be ashamed of the remuneration we receive.  Instead of &#8364;24,000, the person writing in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>suggested &#8364;10,000, less than half the minimum wage.  He suggested we should get rid of our personal assistants, the people who behave so marvellously for us.  We would be utterly neutered and the House would be a laughing stock.  What nonsense comes out of academe.  <\/p><p> There have been Bills and rumours of Bills all over this House.  There have been solo runs predicted here, there and yon, with people included and excluded.  I say to fellow Senators to get your act together if you want to save this House.  Let us get behind a Bill.  If this is the Bill it has to be, then so be it.  Let us vote for it.  Do not extinguish a voice.  I would not have been allowed a voice.  The Minister's party would not have allowed me a voice in the Oireachtas of this great republic.  I would have been excluded.  People like me never would have had a chance.  However, I got my own way in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600042#QQ00200","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362588900,"counter":281,"content":"<p>The Senator must conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600043#RR00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1362588900,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Yeats got in and said that we were no petty people.

Despite numerous reports over the years, we have not succeeded in achieving all-party agreement on substantive reform of the Seanad.  There have been eight reports on Seanad reform since 1943, the most recent in 2004.  None led to programmes of radical reform.  It is fair to say, therefore, that the political system to date has not embraced wholesale change of the House.  In fairness to Senator Crown and the efforts of others before him, it is difficult to achieve consensus where there can be a variety of views on complex and multifaceted issues.<\/p><p>The programme for Government included a commitment to holding a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad.  This is a difficult and major reform proposal by the Government and, of course, there will be different views as to whether it is the correct approach.  The referendum on the Seanad is a continuation of that reforming agenda.  Ultimately, it is an issue that should and will be decided by the people.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly indicated his intention to proceed with this referendum.  Indeed, earlier today, he confirmed the Government's commitment to the referendum being held in this coming autumn.  In the Programme for Government: Annual Report 2013, launched by the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste this morning, it is confirmed that preparations for the referendum are under way and that Government has approved the drafting of a referendum Bill, which will be published in the next session.  In that context it would be difficult to accept this Bill when the Government has decided to put a different proposal to the people.  Against that background, I do not propose to conduct a forensic analysis of Senator Crown's Bill but I commend him on putting forward some very interesting proposals on reforming this House and extending its franchise.<\/p><p>The Government has committed to a radical overhaul of the way Irish politics and Government work.  The programme for Government outlined an ambitious programme for political reform.  The record of the progress that has been made to date is there for everyone to see in the programme report published today by the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste.  The Government has already introduced and implemented new political funding legislation which includes an effective ban on corporate political donations.  We have provided for a reduction in the number of Members of the D\u00e1il.  At the next general election, political parties will be required to select at least 30% women and 30% men candidates or face losing half their State funding.  Seven years from the general election where this provision first applies, this will rise to 40%.  We have set a time limit of six months on the holding of by-elections.  We have brought into effect reduced spending limits at presidential elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600043#RR00400","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1362588900,"counter":284,"content":"<p>More hypocrisy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600043#RR00500","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1362588900,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Four referendums have already been held in the lifetime of this Government.

Work has commenced on the further development of these proposals.  It is also hoped to have the necessary referendum in the autumn of 2013.<\/p><p>In the meantime, the work of the Constitutional Convention will proceed over the coming year, examining a range of issues, including the D\u00e1il electoral system and giving citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections at Irish embassies or otherwise.  The Taoiseach indicated at the inaugural meeting of the convention that the Government would respond in a timely and considered manner to the recommendations of the convention.  The Government has, in fact, made a formal commitment to giving a public response, through the Houses of the Oireachtas, to each recommendation from the convention within four months of receiving it.  If the Government accepts a recommendation that the Constitution should be amended, the Government response will include a timeframe for the holding of the necessary referendum.  On that basis, we can envisage possibly one, two or more referendums in the autumn.  It is clear, therefore, that this Government is committed to change and to real reform.  The results to date are clear to see, as is the ambition for further reform over the lifetime of this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600043#RR00600","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1362589500,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire.  I also enthusiastically endorse the efforts of my friend and colleague, Senator Crown, in putting forward a very meaningful proposal on Seanad reform and on Seanad electoral reform.  One of the downsides of this initiative is that on the face of it, it is a very complex Bill.  I would have preferred it to be more simple in its execution.  I have no difficulty whatsoever with its approach.  The attempt is to widen the franchise to include the citizens of Ireland and to increase the university representation.  I have never understood why successive Governments have failed to act on the 1979 referendum, which would have extended the university franchise to all those who are third level graduates as a result of the development of our education system over the past 30 years.<\/p><p>  The response from the Minister was predictable.  The Government has set sail on a course, led by the Taoiseach, to abolish this House.  It is interesting that a meeting was held last week between the Labour Party Senators and the Labour Party leader, the T\u00e1naiste, Deputy Gilmore.  Although I was not a fly on the wall, inevitably in politics - and particularly in this House, which is a like hothouse - things emerged.  When we were in government, they emerged from Fianna F\u00e1il parliamentary party meetings on a regular basis.  I notice the same tradition continues with the parliamentary party meetings of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  My understanding is, although I could stand corrected, that the T\u00e1naiste's opening remarks were: &quot;Your jobs are gone, boys and girls.&quot;  So much for putting it to the people to give them a choice in this.  The Government is quite determined that it wants to get rid of this House.  <\/p><p>  It is all very well for the Minister to talk about reform.  When one looks at what he is trumpeting in terms of reform, what will it do to enact a more effective Legislature?  What, for example, is the relevance of a reduction in State funding to a more effective form of government?  I heard nothing whatsoever in the part in which he referred to the Government being committed to a radical overhaul of the way Irish politics and government work.  I have heard nothing whatsoever about any attempt to dilute what is effectively the most centralised form of government in Europe outside of Stalinism.  That is what we have in this country and it has been emphasised as a result of the last general election.  This Government enjoys an unprecedented majority.  The Executive can bring forward proposals to the D\u00e1il to rubber-stamp Government policy, and it does so on a regular basis.  The Minister can talk about having all the debates in the world.  I am not a bit surprised some Deputies do not bother turning up for debates when Government proposals are introduced, because there is no chance they will be changed.  <\/p><p>  Is there any suggestion in these reform proposals of improving, enhancing or strengthening the role of the committee system, which is the norm in many European democracies?  If a decision has to be made in Brussels, an Irish Minister can make the decision because he or she knows it will be rubber-stamped by the D\u00e1il.  However, a Danish Minister cannot do so and must go back to the relevant house committee to put the proposal before the representatives of the people.  Why can this House not be used for that purpose?<\/p><p>  Most people are anti-politics and anti-politicians and the sentiment may now be towards abolition.  The Referendum Commission will be legally and constitutionally obliged to put forward the two sides of the argument and the information will be sent to every house in this country.  No other party, of which I am aware, outside of the Government parties is committed to the abolition of this House.  Parties may have differing views on how the House should proceed but Fianna F\u00e1il, Sinn F\u00e9in and the vast majority of the Independents would not support abolition.  Indeed, even within the Labour Party and the Fine Gael parliamentary parties, there are people who are opposed to abolition.  <\/p><p>  I had better not give his name in case I get it wrong, but last year an academic who has a track record of analysing and assessing politics in this country, including elections and referendums, stated in, I think, <i>The Irish Times<\/i> that no referendum has ever been passed in this country in the absence of political consensus.  It has only been when the political establishment has coalesced in the interests of the country as it saw them that referendums have been passed.  <\/p><p>  The Taoiseach and the Government may think they will have an easy ride with regard to how this House will proceed in the future and that it is only a matter of putting out a referendum Bill, which, according to Senator Crown, will cost the country &#8364;19 million.  It is time another canard was nailed.  The cost of this House is between &#8364;8 million and &#8364;9 million.  I understand the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform said the abolition of the Seanad, if it happens, will not be a cost-saving exercise because the money will be deployed into an as yet unstated reform agenda.  This was an opportunity for that Minister to talk about reform in the electoral context but there was no reference at all to the plan B in the event of the Seanad being abolished.  <\/p><p>  I welcome this opportunity to put a number of items on the record.  I compliment Senator Crown on the Bill, which in normal circumstances would have a fair wind behind it, but I am afraid sentiment on the other side of the House is totally opposed to his thinking in this regard.  However, that should not in any way diminish the efforts he has made, which I fully support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600044#SS00150","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1362589500,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I welcome the debate on Seanad reform - in fact, we should have a debate on it every week because some members of the public do not know what the Seanad does.

We will have a referendum and it will be up to the people whether we have a Seanad but it is up to us to inform the people so that they make an informed decision.<\/p><p>I commend Senator Crown on the work he has put into the Bill.  The Minister said there were eight reports on the Seanad but I thought there were 12 reports, all of which are worthy documents in their own right.  Senators Zappone and Quinn published a comprehensive document last summer which proposed a range of measures to transform the Seanad without the need for a constitutional change.  <\/p><p>We will have a referendum, but I would like to see a &quot;preferendum&quot; with the options of &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Change&quot;.  A recent and extensive Oireachtas report on the subject published by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in 2003 remains a practical framework from which significant reform could be implemented.  As is noted in this consultation paper, all 11 reports advocated reform and concluded the same thing.  The fundamental problem with the Seanad in its present guise is the electoral system.  We all recognise that and we want it broadened out.  Senator Crown's Bill does that - I will go through the system outlined in it later - but I do not think it is the way to do it.  It is over-politicised at the moment and we all agree it should be changed, but how we do so is the issue.<\/p><p>In regard to the panels or constituencies, the system outlined in the Bill is a bit cumbersome.  It would be easy enough for anyone to get 1,000 signatures if he or she stood outside a church after Mass.  The terminology used in the descriptions of the panels is very broad.  In addition, if signatures were not verified before the vote, one could end up with the disqualification of Senators and half the Seanad disqualified.  There is nothing in this Bill to provide for returning officers to verify one in four signatures.<\/p> <p>If there are 40,000 signatures on each panel and there are five panels that will be equal to 200,000 signatures and 14 days must elapse from the last signature until the date closes.  That places a huge onus on the returning officer.  <\/p><p>The panels are too broad and there is a strange type of language used.  The term &quot;literature&quot; was used.  Does that refer to anybody who can read a book?  Does it refer to teaching?  Nearly all of the adult population has done some type of work during their lives and could claim to have &quot;laboured&quot;.  The panels, as described, are so broad one wonders why have them at all.  Why not leave it open like the EU elections?  Why not have X number of constituencies rather than panels?  A panel system can be good but it lacks definition in the legislation.<\/p><p>There could be verification problems with certificates of attestation and achievement.  How will it be done?  Who will verify certificates of achievement?  We all know how easy it is to duplicate and photocopy certificates.  All achievements must be certified, authenticated and verified but the means of doing so has not been verified in the Bill.  There is a great onus on the returning officer to do this work.  He or she could do it but the scheme is unworkable.<\/p><p>Section 28 states that polls for the Seanad must be held on the same day as the D\u00e1il in order to save money.  I would prefer if it was held on the same day as EU elections.  No reference has been made to posters.

I believe that we need a re-imagined Seanad.  We need a Seanad that is not hopelessly compromised by political patronage and a massive democratic deficit.  Does simply abolishing the Seanad necessarily increase democracy?  In my view it does not.  If political failure lies at the heart of Ireland's economic collapse, and if we are in a climate of a changing Ireland and a socio-political moment when reform seem possible, a re-imagined Seanad to enhance democracy and expert law-making opens exciting possibilities.<\/p><p>Reform of the Seanad must be coupled with a radical reform of the D\u00e1il and its procedures which though promised we have yet to see realised.  I passionately believe that we need a re-imagined Seanad that incorporates the principles of democracy, inclusive representativeness and expertise.  I, too, along with Senator Quinn and others, have worked on the issue for a long time with extraordinary detail, robust political science research and expert legal advice.  Our proposals can be grouped according to four prime building blocks.<\/p><p>First, we can reform the Seanad radically through legislation.  We do not require a referendum to do so.  Our carefully crafted Bill is almost completed.  Second, we can increase substantially Ireland's democratic governance by providing a one person, one vote system for 43 of the 60 Seanad seats.  Third, a reform of the candidate selection and electoral system for Seanad seats can increase non-mainstream and marginalised voices being represented in Irish democracy.  It can also increase professional and sectoral expertise being brought to the scrutiny of Irish law-making.  Fourth, the Seanad's remit and its ways of conducting business can be changed so that it becomes more effective and fills current gaps in the legislative process.<\/p><p>I have some questions to ask my Seanad colleagues.

Is that not what the Government has done with the recent referendum on children's rights?  Is that not what the Government is doing with regard to a number of prime policy areas?<\/p><p>When it comes to one of the most critical issues of all, the overall governance of the State, I am left with the following question.  Would my colleagues, especially the Fine Gael and Labour Party Senators, please ask the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste why this undue haste?  There has been no consultation with the people, including the current members of the Seanad.  The Government has flatly refused, with absolutely no rationale, to put the issue into the Constitutional Convention.  As we are all aware, not one of the many reports published on the role of the Seanad have called for its abolition.  The reports have all called for its reform.  <\/p><p>The Government wants to hold a referendum to abolish the Seanad without plans for a genuine and radical reform of the D\u00e1il.  The D\u00e1il is a fusion of the Executive and the Legislature with the practices of the Whip system and the guillotine.  The Government says that we will have a radically reformed committee system that will ensure that proper checks and balances happen without a Seanad.  Can the people expect that enhanced committees can do the job?   Committees are constituted by elected representatives from local constituencies.  Can the people expect that, in this context, Deputies will be capable of shedding their political views, party affiliations and electoral concerns for the purpose of making the right law for all of the people?<\/p><p>Senator Crown's Bill puts the issue of Seanad reform to the House and that is a good thing.  It incorporates the democratic principle of one person, one vote for the seats that can be chosen within the limitations of the Constitution which is also a good thing.  There is no adequate rationale for the current party-political control of Seanad candidacy and electoral process for the 43 panel seats.<\/p><p>The Bill also simplifies the process of becoming a candidate for a panel on foot of a petition signed by 1,000 people who attest to the person's suitability to run for a particular panel.  Senator Crown has stated that his rationale for the simplification of the process is to open up candidacy to anyone.  It is critical to open up candidacy but it should not be done at the expense of expertise or the potential for greater inclusiveness in representation.<\/p><p>In the Bill the bar for the determination of the candidate's requisite knowledge of relevance to the particular panel is set very low, too low.  It considerably reduces the potential for the Seanad to be peopled by experts within the sectors or constituencies of the panels.  The measure would reduce the potential for a distinctive legislative scrutiny provided by Senators.  There is no stated rationale contained in the Bill, or in any research that underpinned the Bill, to abolish the role of nominating bodies.  We should change how candidates are nominated to stand for the panels by initiating a dramatic expansion of the nominating bodies.  If a Bill were to modernise the criteria whereby an organisation could become a nominating body it would open up Seanad \u00c9ireann to civil society.  A couple of weeks ago I hosted, along with some of my Independent colleagues, a public meeting for civil society and arts organisations which might be interested in becoming nominating bodies.  Representatives of more than 60 organisations showed up and they demonstrated significant enthusiasm for the possibility that this provided them to influence the political process.  The potential involvement of these organisations could allow non-mainstream, minority and marginalised voices to become part of Seanad \u00c9ireann.<\/p> <p> I must raise another question about the risk in Senator John Crown's scheme that non-resident Irish passport holders could swamp the voters list in all constituencies.  While it might be an appropriate policy objective to entitle non-resident Irish citizens a vote, is the Senator casting the net too wide?<\/p><p>I raise two more issues to raise.  First, has Senator John Crown missed an opportunity, already signalled by Senator C\u00e1it Keane, to include gender quotas in legislation to reform the Seanad?  We are exploring how this could be done, thereby incorporating a mechanism that would promote inclusive representation.<\/p><p>Second, Senator John Crown's effort to legislate for the 1979 constitutional amendment to extend the electorate for the university seats does not<\/p><p>appear to be fair, nor would it reduce the charge of elitism.  Why not have one six seat constituency in which all graduates of third level colleges could vote?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600045#TT01700","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362590700,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Because it would be completely unmanageable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600046#UU00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1362590700,"counter":307,"content":"<p>It is my considered opinion that the Upper House, the Seanad, should be reformed in the interests of the governance of the State.

The article by Mr. Eoin O'Malley of DCU in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i> in which he proposes radical reform of the Seanad has a great deal of merit to it.  It reminds me of a debate in which Mr. Michael McDowell and I spoke some months ago when we were both on the same side in favour of reform.  Mr. McDowell summed it up by saying we should cut it down, pay them less but keep the Seanad in a very different format.  That is the debate we will have more of, which I welcome coming up to the referendum.<\/p><p>  Senator Katherine Zappone identified various flaws in Senator John Crown's Bill.  I do not want to dwell on them, but section 4 provides that no person should be a candidate in a D\u00e1il election and also a Seanad election.  I wonder about the constitutionality of restricting candidacy in that way and would be concerned about that particular element of the Bill.  <\/p><p>  There are issues that can be raised, but in general it is welcome that we have the opportunity to debate this question of reform through legislation because it is one that will come back into focus if the referendum is not passed.  There must be a reflection on that issue too on the Government side.<\/p><p>  On the 90th anniversary of the Seanad in December I referred Members of the House to a wonderful paper which presented extensive research on the Seanad.  It was produced by the senior counsel and Fianna F\u00e1il councillor, Mr. Jim O'Callaghan, who wrote about the history of the Seanad.  The key message is that throughout the 90 years of the Seanad there have been endless calls for abolition and debates on retention.  As we are aware, Fianna F\u00e1il abolished the Seanad in 1936 after the Seanad had voted down a Government Bill to restrict the wearing of uniforms.  However, following the abolition of the Seanad, there was an extensive debate on the merits of a bicameral, as opposed to a unicameral, system.  As a result of that debate, public opinion appeared to change to the extent that a second House was provided for in the 1937 Constitution, with a somewhat different format.  Since the reconstitution of the Seanad, there have been numerous calls for abolition.<\/p><p>  The Seanad has a strong history in a number of respects, particularly in terms of Committee Stage debates on Bills.  Strong and thoughtful debates have taken place in the House, the great merit being that Senators on both sides can contribute.  They do not have to be specialists or spokespersons on a particular area, but they can contribute their expertise on particular provisions of a Bill.  We can all recall very good examples of such debates.<\/p><p>  The Seanad has a strong history of introducing Private Members' Bills.  This Private Members' debate is being held in that context.  We have seen Senator Feargal Quinn's Bill on construction contracts being brought before the House, while I have introduced two Bills, one on female genital mutilation and the other on humanist weddings, which were subsequently supported by different Governments.  <\/p><p>  The Seanad has a strong history of introducing and debating issues not considered to any great extent in the D\u00e1il.  If the referendum is defeated, the call for reform will become unarguable.  I hope we will see radical reform, both in the method of election and the working structures of the Seanad, reforms that could be introduced through legislation and without further constitutional change.<\/p><p>  Dr. Elaine Byrne suggested some years ago that a physical sign of the Seanad, the Seanad casket and signatures, should be put on permanent public display, perhaps in Leinster House.  I believe they are still in the Royal Irish Academy.  I have raised that issue previously in the House and the Minister might take it on board, if nothing else as a memory of the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600046#UU02100","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1362590700,"counter":324,"content":"<p>While the Minister is welcome, I must admit this is a Bill I support.  We should support it and I urge everybody in the House to give it serious consideration.<\/p><p>I have been a Member of the House for 20 years and viewed the very good work done in this Seanad.  When we consider the number of times it has corrected and amended legislation, it would be a shame to abolish it.<\/p><p>I do not agree with those who say there have been many calls for abolition.  I have not heard any such call.  They come out of the blue and they are not right.  If anything, this is a power grab by the D\u00e1il to have more authority.  We need a second opinion which is essential in respect of any item of legislation.  Owing to the current party system, we find ourselves in a situation where the parties elected to the D\u00e1il agree a programme for Government behind the scenes to the extent that individual Members do not have an opportunity to do anything.  <\/p><p>I support Senator John Crown in introducing the Bill, a number of aspects of which would bring many benefits to the political system.  In response to Senator C\u00e1it Keane and others, if changes take place, we should make sure they are made on Committee Stage.  There may be some aspects that could be improved, but if we accept the Bill, it will benefit the political system and our democracy.<\/p> <p>What is so good about the legislation is that it will offer citizens a choice which is not a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" to the Seanad but a third choice, one of reform.  Senator John Crown has written about the matter this week and what he wrote was very interesting.  He wrote, \"Senators who vote for the Bill are not necessarily opposing Seanad abolition, rather, they are enhancing the choice facing the citizenry in the referendum.\"  We must remember that fact.  As public representatives, Senators are facilitating the ability to make different choices.  Surely, that is the very minimum a public representative can do.  Many of the proposals in the Bill are the sorts of things people have been calling for.  Similar proposals have been made in the recently published document we talked about tonight; open it, do not close it.  As Senator Crown says, the process of candidate selection should be democratised and any citizen should be allowed to contest Seanad elections through a process of popular nomination.  Candidates will require the signatures of 1,000 citizens on their nomination papers.  There has been some criticism of that and, if it is not the correct approach, it can be changed easily on Committee Stage.  Candidates would not need the backing of a party and the right to elect candidates to the university panels would be extended to graduates of the University of Limerick, Dublin City University and the institutes of technology.<\/p><p>These are straightforward, sensible proposals within the limits of the Constitution.  Voting rights would be extended to allow a wider variety of voices to be heard.  Real world opinions and expertise from different voices are exactly what we need, in particular those from the business and voluntary sectors.  I have a fear that there are too many voices here that come from limited sectors of society.  We need politicians who can see the country from a national point of view.  We talk about innovation and the smart economy but elected officials with concrete ideas to improve our society are either stifled by the need to look after local constituents or by the current party-political system.  Senator John Crown has often referred to the fact that many Senators refer to &quot;their constituencies&quot; meaning the D\u00e1il constituency in which they live notwithstanding that their Seanad constituency is the panel that elected them.  We need representation of communities that are not regionally based.  A reformed Seanad could provide for this to an even greater extent in the future.  The reforms contained in the Bill would enable the Seanad to fulfil the role envisaged by the designers of the Constitution.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has arrived and is very welcome.  It is the second day in a row she has attended.  She is getting very fond of us.  I wish her party was as fond of us.<\/p><p>The concept of creating panels as conceived on the drafting of the Constitution originally was sound.  The mistake that was made was to give the right to elect Members solely to party politicians.  It has weakened the system.  If Senator John Crown's Bill is passed, it will allow the voices of all citizens to be heard through new voting rights.  We must hear the voices of groups, including minorities and the diaspora.  The Seanad could be a more gender-balanced Chamber than the D\u00e1il.  A reformed Seanad would truly represent our society and be composed of a diverse range of professionals and experts.  It would have the ability to more deeply scrutinise and improve legislation.  It would be able to reject poor legislation or legislation which improperly encroached on citizens' rights.  The public will own the House if it has a vote.  A system whereby they would acquire such a vote would work very well.  What we set out to achieve in 1937 was not to challenge the D\u00e1il, create a second D\u00e1il or seek further powers.  We do not need further powers.  The original concept was that the bicameral system was more useful than a unicameral one.  It provides a second opinion and view of all legislation as it comes through.  It is still the case.<\/p><p>The Seanad provides oversight on every Bill.  During my years as a Member, thousands of amendments have been made to numerous Bills in the Seanad.  A large number of Bills have been initiated in the House.  To abolish the Seanad removes the ability to do that.  Many enactments have been improved no end in the Seanad and it would be a great shame to do away with its oversight.  We should learn from the mistakes of the Celtic tiger and realise we need more oversight of our systems, not less.  It would be a great mistake to do that.  The Seanad has been made an easy scapegoat for political parties ahead of a general election.  We need a more mature attitude.  The Seanad has often been marginalised as successive Governments have wanted to curtail its ability to place a check on the Government.  To pander to populism and abolish the Seanad will simply weaken the ability of the Oireachtas to hold the Government to account.  We need a reformed alternative.  One must not forget that the Seanad has the power to initiate legislation.  Senator Bacik referred to my Construction Contracts Bill which we hope will become law next month.  It aims to improve conditions for business and subcontractors in general.  I think of other Bills as introduced by Senator Bacik and others.  They have become law or are becoming law.  Whether they are enacted as initiated or changed, we must not forget that Members of the Oireachtas sit as legislators and are not here just to grandstand or gain newspaper column inches.  I welcome the provision in the Bill that the Seanad be dissolved at the same time as the D\u00e1il, which makes a great deal of sense.<\/p><p>The Seanad is far from perfect.  It should be reformed and modernised, but the current talk of shutting it down is a mere political smokescreen and a distraction from the very real financial and economic difficulties faced by ordinary citizens.  The debate on political reform should not be focused entirely on the Seanad but on how the Oireachtas as a whole can be improved and whether Government can be made more accountable and transparent.  In general, citizens do not have a right to vote for the Seanad and do not, therefore, feel any ownership of the House.  The public will own the Seanad if it has that vote and that voice.  I do not seek a stronger Seanad, which I do not consider that we need.  I seek a Seanad that will perform better.  To do so, the public will have to own it.  Senator Crown has shown us one system of ownership for citizens.<\/p><p>Our goal as legislators is to improve the lives of citizens.  Removing a layer of protection from citizens by abolishing the Seanad is not the way forward.  We need desperately to have greater oversight not less.  We must move away from the spin that currently permeates all levels of our political system.  Anyone can see that a lack of oversight over Government decisions is a recipe for disaster.  Government cannot be free to introduce whatever legislation it likes and expect it to be passed.  Having debates on such legislation in the House is well worthwhile.  We need a reformed Seanad that can increase the effectiveness of the Oireachtas as a whole.  Cross-party support for the Bill would be a great step in the reform process.  Merely by passing the Bill, Senators would show that they want to enable the public to have greater choices as to the future of the Seanad.  That is particularly pro-democratic.  I am glad that a fellow Senator is demonstrating by introducing this Bill that the Seanad is taking the future into its own hands.  It is worthy of support.  I urge Members to support it.  If there are changes to take place, they can be made on Committee Stage.  I congratulate Senator Crown for introducing the Bill.  Members should ensure that they provide him with the support that he deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600046#UU02200","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362591300,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to the House.

I look forward with keen interest to the publication of further legislation on Seanad reform by Senator Feargal Quinn, Senator Katherine Zappone and others.<\/p><p>I was in the Citywest Hotel, Dublin, in September 2009 when the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, who was then the leader of Fine Gael in opposition, announced to a hushed audience his proposal to abolish the Seanad.  I was at the Glenties summer school two or three months earlier when he announced his view of what the Seanad could be and how its role could be expanded and enhanced.  I was at the meeting of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party - and this is why I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, has left - in June 2009 when, as part of our document on what we termed &quot;new politics&quot;, we provided a strong, dynamic blueprint for a new, improved, enhanced and democratised Seanad.<\/p> <p>I want to reflect on that policy because it provided a roadmap to this and any future Seanad.  We favoured the election of approximately half of the Members of Seanad \u00c9ireann directly by the public, an election to take place on the same day as the election for the European Parliament, an extension of voting rights to all university and third level college graduates, and as far as I recall, an enhancement of the panel system.  It was a very well worked-out document.  That is why I was so surprised when three or four months later we did not just do a U-turn but an absolute about turn and decided that our policy was now in favour of abolishing Seanad \u00c9ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600047#VV00200","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362591900,"counter":328,"content":"<p>For shame.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600048#WW00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1362591900,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I will not comment.<\/p><p>I look forward to participating in this crucial debate over the next few months.  I do not know of any country or society which has found that less democracy was better than more.  I do not know of any houses of parliament which have found that reducing the number of participants, of those asking questions, resulted in better politics.  As we said yesterday in discussing another Bill, the public seeks better politics.<\/p><p>The shallow debate about the cost of politics and politicians is quickly forgotten when people reflect on what politics is.  It involves representing the people, decision-making, investigating, bringing forward ideas and suggestions.  This House has played a huge and historically proud role in that tradition and can do so again.  If real political reform was as simple as scrapping Seanad \u00c9ireann it could and would have been done a long time ago.<\/p><p>We do need better politics and we need to start in the House occupied by 166 elected Members, namely, D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.  We spoke about the promises made in the recent general election and how we have to fulfil those commitments.  To the best of my knowledge many parties promised that the D\u00e1il would be reduced by 20 or 30 people, not eight.  We have quickly forgotten that.  We promised in the programme for Government - we get very excited about it regarding it as a latter day Bible - that D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann would sit four days a week.  One Friday per month is what I call fraudulent Friday, when no votes can be taken, no questions can be asked, a simple quorum is required and people go merrily home at 12 o'clock.  God help us if that is D\u00e1il or political reform.<\/p><p>With this Bill and that of Senator Zappone and others on the agenda, I look forward over the next few months to a real debate about political reform because it is truly important that we examine how this country is run.  It is particularly important that we examine the role of elected persons in this or the other House.  We are arriving at a dangerous situation where elected Members of the D\u00e1il, who are not members of the Government, are entirely irrelevant.  They have no say.  This situation has become even more serious because the role of Minister who is not a member of the all-powerful economic management council within the Cabinet is also very reduced.  That needs to be examined from a constitutional perspective.  Deep and lengthy questions are needed on politics and reform.<\/p><p>This afternoon Senator Crown made his pitch and presentation.  I have not examined the Bill in the detail that I perhaps should have done because I received a copy of it only yesterday.  I have ideological difficulties with the idea of voting rights for emigrants.  Maybe I am an old-fashioned traditionalist but I still find it difficult to grapple with the old phrase of &quot;no representation without taxation&quot;.  All of this can be debated and teased out and I look forward to that debate.<\/p><p>The Constitutional Convention was mentioned.  That is the other part of the new Bible of political correctness.  It is absolutely politically insulting that a constitutional convention can be tasked with discussing the silly question of whether 16 year olds should be allowed to vote but it is not allowed to reflect on whether there should be a second Chamber of Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600048#WW00300","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1362591900,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.

This country suffers from a national democratic deficit unparalleled in the Western world.  Consider this, only 2% of the laws passed in Ireland every year are debated and scrutinised by the D\u00e1il and Seanad.  The other 98% are made by way of EU regulations, directives and statutory instruments brought into effect by Ministers and Ministers of State and by the EU without any consideration by this House.  If one were to think of a country in which only 2% of its laws were scrutinised by the parliament one would say the UN should be brought in.  Any country with that level of democratic deficit would be worthy of EU intervention.<\/p><p>Deputy Emmet Stagg said that the scrutiny of statutory instruments does not happen.  Last August for the first time Ireland brought in organ transplant legislation.  How was that done?  Does anyone remember it coming before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children?  Does anyone remember it coming before the D\u00e1il or in here?  No one remembers that because it did not happen.  The Minister for Health came back from his holidays last August and signed an EU directive into law bringing into effect 64 pages of legislation on organ transplantation.<\/p> <p>All the organ donation organisations and those involved in that sector have serious concerns about the way that was done yet it was not debated here.  Does that reflect a country that suffers from a democratic deficit?  It most certainly does.  The power rests, as we all know, in the hands of a few.  It is time that democracy was restored to the people who were elected by the citizens of the country.  <\/p><p>Some 184 years ago Daniel O'Connell, the Great Emancipator, ensured that Catholics got the right to vote.  Some 95 years ago the franchise was extended to women and 45 years ago Nationalists marched in Derry for one person, one vote.  There are 1.8 million people living in the North and 800,000 Irish passport holders living overseas, which represents 36% of those entitled to be Irish citizens under Articles 2o and 3o of our Constitution, yet we do not give them a vote.  Of the 33 countries that are members of the Council of Europe only four do not give votes to their citizens overseas.  We are in great company with Cyprus, Malta and Greece.  Of the 196 countries in the world 115 give votes to their citizens overseas, but we do not do that.  We have a diaspora of 70 million.  We have passport holders living overseas, who number the combined populations of the cities of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Galway and Limerick, to whom we do not give a vote.  Why do we not give a vote to the 46,500 citizens who emigrated last year who are concerned about what is happening at home in terms of them deciding to come back home?<\/p><p>In Portugal 20% of the voters live outside the state yet they are all entitled to vote in their elections.  Only four seats are ring-fenced for them, yet they have an entitlement to vote.  I do not consider that to be practical here.  I do not think the political establishment would allow one seat in the D\u00e1il Chamber to be voted on by one person who is an Irish citizen living overseas or living in the North.  In France 12 Senate seats are given to those representing citizens overseas but we will not do that here.  <\/p><p>I commend Senator Crown and his legal team, including Shane and the others, on bringing forward this Bill.  The fact that the Minister did not even address the Bill shows the contempt of the Government and why we need reform of the political system, of the D\u00e1il and the Seanad.  He as good as said: &quot;we are getting rid of you and I am not even going to look at this Bill.&quot;  As the Members of the Government parties opposite and the Government Deputies in the other House would know, the contempt shown by Cabinet Ministers towards the D\u00e1il, towards the democratic system, is there for all to see because it is a rubber stamp exercise.  The Cabinet holds the power.  It brings forward the legislation.  The TD's job is to get elected in order that he or she can rubberstamp legislation.  We need reform of the entire democratic system.

At times it has resembled animals trying to avoid the slaughter.  However, tonight's debate brought about by Senator Crown's Seanad Electoral Reform Bill provides us as legislators with a tangible Bill for discussion.  First, it is important to place on record my congratulations and appreciation for Senator Crown's rather solo run to bring us this Bill before the Chamber this evening.  During his campaign and contributions since arriving here he has always stated his belief that the Seanad needed reform and that he was intending to attempt to instigate that reform.  He has followed up on his words by actions and I thank him for that.

I am not a politician at heart nor am I a political scientist.  I would like to think my comments in the House this evening and in general reflect the public's feelings on a given issue.  <\/p><p>It is my contention that the Seanad struggles to be a meaningful Upper House due to the stranglehold the political parties have on it due to the electoral system.  The current process ensures that the Government of the day will have a cosy and safe majority and the remainder of the other seats will be awarded to other political parties.  To borrow the President, Michael D. Higgins's words &quot;independence of mind&quot; tends to be a rarity in this Chamber, usually the preserve of the university Senators and it has been extended during this Seanad to the Taoiseach's nominees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600049#XX01000","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1362592500,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600049#XX01100","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1362592500,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Under Senator Crown's Bill every citizen entitled to vote in local elections will be entitled to a Seanad vote.  This undoubtedly would break the hold to some extent that the political establishment has on the Seanad's membership.  Also worth noting is a clause that ensures that Seanad elections will occur on the same day as the D\u00e1il polling day.  I welcome this.  By extension, it will also stop people running for both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This would lessen the unsavoury and widespread practice by political parties of treating the Upper House as either a Montessori or kindergarten for future D\u00e1il candidates or as a nice retirement home for failed D\u00e1il candidates or party loyalists.<\/p><p>The proposal in the Bill to extend the electoral franchise to Irish citizens living abroad for Seanad elections is one I strongly support and welcome.  I am sure that would be welcomed by anybody who has a friend, a niece or a child who has had the bad luck to have to emigrate in the past five years.  I remind Members that during the height of the recession 110 people per day were leaving our shores seeking employment abroad.  I do not have the exact numbers.  We have a diaspora of 70 million, but if we think of the past seven years and the many people who did not want to leave Ireland and had to leave, surely, for starters, they deserve a vote.   I would also remind Members that it is not easy for a person who is abroad to vote.  One has to leave the job one hopefully has in Boston, Chicago or Abu Dhabi and find the consulate or embassy and register to vote.<\/p> <p>Then on polling day, one must reregister and place one's vote.  It is not just a question of going online and clicking \"pick\".  It is not an easy thing to do but I welcome the fact that it is stretched across the world to our diaspora.  It is funny that we dream up things like The Gathering and we expect those abroad to support it.  Why not therefore give these people a vote?<\/p><p>The new system envisaged in the Bill to nominate candidates is to be welcomed and should ensure that it is easier for people to contest a Seanad election if they wish.  Thankfully, it would bring an end to the undemocratic situation whereby fewer than 2,000 people decide the outcome of the panel elections, which amount to 43 seats in this Chamber.  The ending of the practice of nominating bodies for these panels is no bad thing to my mind.  <\/p><p>I have heard Senator Crown explain in media interviews earlier this week that to remove the Taoiseach's nominees or the university Senators from the make-up of the Seanad would require a constitutional referendum.  I can accept this point despite my reservations about both panels, as I know there is little public appetite for referendums due largely to the huge cost associated with running them.<\/p><p>Given that the electoral system is freer and less under the control of the political parties, it might not necessarily be a bad thing and may help to avoid legislative stalemates.  I suggest it might make this reform pill easier to swallow for the political parties.  Where I differ strongly from Senator Crown is in his proposals for the structure of university seats.  This Bill, if passed, would see the creation of three university panels - a Trinity panel, a National University of Ireland panel and a panel for other higher institutions - each consisting of two seats.  I would like to encourage Senator Crown, when he speaks later, to explain his rationale at to why Trinity is afforded two seats.  Trinity is one institution so I need to hear why it deserves two seats while the other universities and institutes of technology are lumped into two panels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600049#XX01200","speaker":"1169","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362593100,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Simply a matter of quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600050#YY00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1362593100,"counter":349,"content":"<p>This Bill is meant to be about reform and making this Chamber more reflective of Irish society.

Could we move Dublin City University and University of Limerick graduates into Senator Crown's proposed Trinity panel?  These are only meant to be alternative ideas.<\/p><p>As I said at the outset, I strongly welcome and support this Bill.

Senator Bradford set a good example for all other Government Senators that maybe it is an evening to begin discussion and debate, and bring our opinions while not being swayed by politics.

I wish to commend Senator Crown for tabling this Bill which my party will support, despite the fact that we have difficulties with some of its aspects.  I understand the constitutional constraints under which the Senator was working in terms of what provisions and changes could be allowed for in the context of tabling such legislation.  If I had a blank canvas with which to reform the Seanad I would do so constitutionally.  I would have used the opportunity of the Constitutional Convention, which is the best place.  It includes citizens who have been appointed and independently selected by the State to examine a range of constitutional reform issues.  It is a source of deep regret that the Seanad was not one of those issues.<\/p><p>The previous contributor spoke about a journey, but I am not quite sure what journey we are on.  The problem is that the Taoiseach and both parties in power have decided that they want to abolish the Seanad.  It looks like they will press ahead with a referendum sometime this year.  The simple proposition to the people will be &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to keep this House as it is.  <\/p><p>I do not think there are many in the State who would want to keep this House as it is.  Everyone I have spoken to says they are in favour of reforming the Seanad.  They want a second Chamber that is more democratic, has more powers, can act to provide greater checks and balances against the D\u00e1il, and can scrutinise EU legislation and any amount of ideas that are out there.  However, I have not heard a single person say that they would like this House to be kept as it is.  Everybody accepts that there are defects and that it does need to be reformed.  <\/p><p>There is a lot of talk about more ideas, reports and publications but we have had any amount of reports on Seanad reform.  There have been good reports, good analyses and good discussions.  Senator Norris spoke about some contributions he has made and I am sure that over the years many pieces of legislation and reports were brought before this House.  The simple reality is, however, that they were all ignored by the political establishment at the time.  No party in government has ever dealt with the thorny issue of Seanad reform.  They have all abdicated their responsibilities. <\/p><p>The same people who failed to properly reform the Seanad are now saying that we should abolish it.  The people who failed in their duties to put forward proper, meaningful and democratic reforms are now saying that the solution is abolition.  Abolition is not reform, however.  If we abolish this House we will lose 60 Senators in the context of all the other measures the Government is putting in place when it talks about political reform.<\/p><p>We had a discussion recently with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, on political reform, which means fewer councillors, councils and TDs together with the abolition of the Seanad.  It is all subtraction and there is no real attempt to deal with the profound changes that are necessary in this country. <\/p><p>Even before we looked at the issue of abolishing the Seanad or reducing the number of TDs, the simple reality is that in this State far too much power lies with the Executive.  What is the real role of a backbench TD?  People may say that Senators do not do a hell of a lot of work and they ask what is the point in having Senators to scrutinise legislation, while others often value the contributions of Senators.  We do not do anything differently to TDs when we scrutinise legislation on all Stages.  We do not have powers on financial measures that come before us but we can scrutinise legislation as well as TDs do.<\/p><p>The real changes that need to be made, however, are not being made.  We need to deal with a democratic deficit in this country.  We have had an economic catastrophe with profound social and economic change.  We have also had a lack of oversight, scrutiny and regulation in other sectors, including banking.  However, the Government does not deal with any of that.  There has not been a single piece of legislation brought through the D\u00e1il or the Seanad that deals with banking regulation or changing what happened there.  It is zero, zilch yet we will have legislation to abolish this House.  The price that is now being put on democracy is to reduce numbers and save money.  They say we will save a few bob by abolishing the Seanad and getting rid of councils, councillors and a number of TDs, and then everything will be all right.  Of course, everything will not be all right because the fundamental changes which need to be made are not being made.  <\/p><p>Senator O'Donnell seems to be very much opposed to the idea of the Irish diaspora voting in elections, given her response to some of the previous contributions.

I congratulate the people who worked with him on bringing the Bill before the House.  We have had some excellent Bills before the House in the history of the Seanad but, unfortunately, I am unable to support Senator Crown this evening.<\/p><p>  Let us consider the definition of a senate.  I mean no disrespect to any Member.  A senate is an assembly or council of citizens having the highest deliberative functions in government, especially a legislative assembly of a state or nation.  Many countries have an assembly called a senate composed of senators who may be elected, appointed or have inherited a title or gained membership by other methods, depending on the country.  Modern senates typically serve as a chamber of sober second thought and consider legislation passed by a lower house.  The word senate is derived from the Latin word <i>senatus<\/i> which comes from <i>senex<\/i>, which means an old man.  I mean no disrespect to the people of this House.  The important phrase is &quot;sober second thought&quot;.  We have had some excellent debate in the House on Bills we have passed.  We have spent a good deal more time legislating than the Lower House and we have put through some excellent amendments for the Minister of State, who is listening.  This Bill is here.  We will have a referendum to abolish the Seanad.  If there was a referendum to get rid of any part of the body politic, whether the local councils or the D\u00e1il, it would be gone because politics does not have a good name in the country.  That is the fault of politicians over the years and because of the way politics was used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600051#ZZ00600","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1362593700,"counter":362,"content":"<p>It is not the fault of the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600051#ZZ00700","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1362593700,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I am coming to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600051#ZZ00800","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1362593700,"counter":364,"content":"<p>No interruptions, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600051#ZZ00900","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1362593700,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Crown and I do not believe the Seanad should be blamed for what happened or used as a fall guy to try to make politics look fair again.

I ran on the agricultural panel and local authority councillors knew who I was because I had met them over the years.  In other words, it would become a local election again.  A person from Kilkenny would support a candidate from Kilkenny and another person would support the person from Donegal.  That part of the legislation is flawed.  It means one must register to vote.  Senator Crown said that people nominate and people elect.  I cannot agree with a situation whereby one must register to vote on a panel.  If I arrived at a polling booth, what would happen?  I would get my general election ballot for the D\u00e1il.  Then I would have to tell the returning officer that I have decided to vote on the agricultural panel on the given day.

Let us consider the Order Paper.  Some two thirds of the items were put down by Members and only one third by the Government.  We need more scrutiny and checks and balances, especially given what happened to the country between 2008 and 2010.  It was not the fault of Senators or D\u00e1il backbenchers - yesterday, we discussed getting rid of or abolishing eight D\u00e1il backbench seats - it was the permanent Government and the Civil Service.  I have never seen a Government so under-the-thumb of the Civil Service as this one.  It has not called the bankers or bank regulators to account.  It is blaming the Seanad for the \u20ac64 billion that walked out of Government Buildings.  There was not one Senator within miles of it when that transaction took place and it is time the Government came to explain what occurred and took measures to deal with it.<\/p><p>Over the weekend, the Chief Justice drew attention to the added problem of a four-year waiting list to have legislation scrutinised by the Supreme Court.  We have put down more than 300 amendments on personal insolvency for the Minister to consider.  We have reached amendment No. 65 on the Taxi Regulation Bill.  This is what we do every day.  We are doing the Irish economy and society a considerable benefit by painstakingly going through Bills and spotting the errors.  No one has a monopoly on wisdom, least of all a Government with a 40 seat D\u00e1il majority heavily dominated by the Executive and controlled by the permanent government.  We need checks and balances.  We need to bring in the expertise of this House.  I learn something every day from the people here.  I cannot imagine how the Taoiseach and T\u00e1naiste believe that anyone here is expendable or should be removed.  It is appalling that the Taoiseach and T\u00e1naiste should go to the people seeking to abolish an arm of government whose job it is to assess how the Taoiseach and T\u00e1naiste are performing.

Why has he gone sour on this House?  Why will he not come here and tell us what is on the charge sheet?  What did we do that has moved him to want to abolish this House?  I do not know.  It is very difficult to respond to somebody who decided without debate or consultation that this House should no longer exist.  <\/p><p>Let us remind the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste of precedent.  The result of the abolition of Grattan's Parliament was misery for decades afterwards.  This House is not perfect - neither was Grattan's Parliament - but abolishing Houses of Parliament does not do much good for democracy because power goes elsewhere to people who are unaccountable.  The abolition of Stormont meant we had to make significant efforts, through former President Clinton and former Prime Minister Blair, to secure the restoration of that Parliament.  I am proud of how well it is working.  The former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, played a role in that regard also.  Countries which abolish democratic assemblies, remove scrutiny and show no respect for parliament are going nowhere.<\/p><p>I am surprised and disappointed by the attitude of the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste towards this House which is an asset as we try to rebuild a country that is bankrupt because of faults in the senior Civil Service, bank regulation and dreadful bankers.

However, that is not what we have.<\/p><p>The Government's stance is very clear - we will have a referendum.  I understand the legislation will be brought before us next month and that we will have a referendum in the autumn - in October or November.  The Government's stance is that it will canvass for the abolition of the Seanad and that if the people decide they want to retain it, there will be plenty of time at that stage to deal with the issue of reform.  Personally, I do not agree with that principle.  We should put before the people what we believe in and what a new Seanad should contain.<\/p><p>The major part of the contents of the reports on Seanad reform deals with how the Seanad is elected.  If the people decide to retain the Seanad, we must deal, first, with how the Seanad is elected.  The Bill proposes that the people should have a say.  I agree totally with the principle that the people should elect the Members of Seanad \u00c9ireann.  The Seanad has been classified as an elitist Chamber, mainly because of how Members are elected.  I believe strongly in the institutions of the State.  Since I entered politics many moons ago, it has always been my opinion that Members should protect and support them and that remains my opinion.<\/p><p>I appeal to Senator John Crown not to divide on this matter tonight.

Part of what I learned there in the brief time I was there is that while one does not get 100% of what one seeks, one gets 80% or 90% through the system in place there, where everyone sits around the table to work out the way forward.  This was clearly demonstrated in these Houses in the first and second weeks of January when the Joint Committee on Health listened to different interest groups putting forward their views for or against the need for legislation to deal with the judgment in the \"X\" case.

It is 11 years since I first made a submission on the issue and I am sure Senators David Norris and Feargal Quinn could go even further back.<\/p><p>The problem with the Seanad has never been Senators.

I will never understand it.  If the people are asked to vote &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;, they will bury the Seanad because of the actions of the Taoiseach and the Minister rather than as a result of any of actions of the Members of this House which are never covered by the media.

It is a good initiative.  The detail of the Bill is not important at this stage, as it can be debated and amended.  The principle is absolutely first class, as is the motivation behind it.  When the recession loomed in 2008, many Members of this House said democracy would be the first casualty of the economic recession.  We are now seeing this happen, unfortunately.  It has been said many times in this House that the Lower House is crying out for reform.  The Government made a commitment in that regard, but its decision to reduce by eight the number of Deputies does not constitute reform.  In the same way, its local government proposals do not constitute reform.  When I say Ministers prefer not to be held to account, I do not confine my accusations to the Government because the same applied when we were in office.  Ministers feel uncomfortable when they are put on the spot for the policies they are pursuing.  In many instances, they are not able to deal with such queries.  The less accountable they are, the happier they are and the happier the bureaucracy is also.  It makes it easier for the permanent government to influence those who are serving in the transient Government.  The control exerted in the Lower House through the rigid application of the Whip and on the Order of Business means that the number of Members of that House could be reduced substantially.  If the D\u00e1il were left to the members of the Government and a handful of others, the same results and outputs would be achieved.  If one speaks to Senators, Deputies and Ministers of State about the Government, they will readily admit they have no power and very little influence in particular areas.  Members of the Cabinet are now saying the same because power has become concentrated in a small elite group - three teachers and a former trade union official - known as the Economic Management Council which is taking decisions that the Constitution provides should be taken by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600053#BBB00500","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1362594900,"counter":402,"content":"<p>That is ridiculous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600053#BBB00600","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1362594900,"counter":403,"content":"<p>What does that have to do with the reform of the Seanad?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600053#BBB00700","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1362594900,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I do not say this lightly, but I am genuinely concerned about the tendency towards totalitarianism in this state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600053#BBB00800","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1362594900,"counter":405,"content":"<p>The Senator is absolutely right for once.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600053#BBB00900","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1362594900,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I really think this drift needs to be arrested and many are speaking about it.

I request that she clarify the legal position on planning conditions otherwise known as enurement clauses which are imposed by some local authorities and have the effect of restricting the sale of a dwelling house for a period of time.  A significant number of people in my constituency in places such as Kinvara, Ballindereen, Athenry, Loughrea and Craughwell have had such clauses attached to their planning applications.  The clauses specify that applicants must come from the area in which they are seeking permission to build; that use of the proposed house is restricted to the applicant and the applicant's family, heirs, executors and administrators; that persons must be involved in agricultural or related activities; and that the applicants must satisfy a housing need stipulation.<\/p><p>Very often enurement clauses can last for a period of seven or ten years.  However, the draconian effect of such clauses can be clearly seen in what Galway County Council did in 2007 when it decided that a 15 year enurement clause would attach to all planning permissions granted in Connemara.  While I accept that the purpose of an enurement clause is to enable the planning authority to grant permission for residential developments in controlled areas, these clauses are, in effect, controlling to whom the property owner may sell a property.  In the circumstances, we must acknowledge that this is essentially a discriminatory practice.  Enurement clauses appear to be in breach of  the right to property, as outlined in chapter 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the free movement of people and other relevant EU legal measures.<\/p><p>We must be very careful about breaching people's rights, in particular, their constitutional rights.  It is essential that we implement practical national measures in order that citizens can rely on them and be allowed to enjoy the full benefits of their property rights.  With this in mind, there must be some flexibility with regard to these clauses.  We must be mindful that these are different times from those during the boom when these clauses were first introduced.  People have become unemployed and need to move house to follow employment opportunities.  Some are in negative equity and seeking to limit their losses.  At best, the people concerned are prevented from selling their houses in the wider marketplace and, at worst, these clauses are preventing people from moving on with their lives.  This is a very important issue, on which I would appreciate a response regarding the plans the Government may have to address the legal anomalies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600054#CCC00900","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1362595500,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The sustainable rural housing guidelines for planning authorities which were published in April 2005 are designed to achieve a balance between a good planning framework for rural housing and the local housing needs of those who are part of or have links with local rural communities.  The guidelines elaborate on and consolidate the approach on rural housing in the national spatial strategy 2002-20 which, <i>inter alia<\/i>, promotes sustainable rural settlement as a key component of delivering more balanced regional development.<\/p><p>  Section 39 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that a condition attached to a grant of planning permission for a house may specify that the house must be occupied by persons of a particular class or description, that is, an occupancy condition, with provision to that effect to be incorporated in an agreement under section 47 of the Act.  The guidelines set out how planning authorities should frame their development plan policies for the different types of rural areas within the development plan area such as rural areas close to large towns and cities or those suffering from population decline.  The guidelines make it clear that occupancy conditions are only appropriate in certain cases such as permissions being granted in areas close to the larger cities and towns which are under strong pressure for urban-generated development and permissions being granted to a permanent resident in an area in which there is an over-concentration of holiday or second-home development.  The conditions also normally specify that planning authorities can give consent to the occupation of the dwelling by a different person with the same category of need as the applicant.  <\/p><p>  The approach set out in the sustainable rural housing guidelines for planning authorities on the use of occupancy or residency clauses remains valid.

A slightly anomaly exists because mortgage companies or banking institutions which repossess houses appear to be completely oblivious to any inurement clauses and they seem to have free rein to resell the homes in question.

There appears to be an inequitable application of the law in this regard.  I would appreciate it if some further developments were forthcoming in this area and if some of the policies relating to inurement clauses could be reconsidered in light of current circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600054#CCC01100","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","time":1362596100,"counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600055#DDD00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1362596100,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I am trying to obtain information in respect of a premises that is going to be available in Gorey, County Wexford.

I thank Senator Michael D'Arcy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the position in respect of the future use of the school building that is currently used to accommodate the newly established post-primary school in Gorey, pending the provision of permanent accommodation for that school.<\/p><p>The Senator may find it helpful if I set out the context within which decisions relating to meeting the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years are made.  Total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 by 2018 - more than 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary level - and will continue to grow up to at least 2024 at post-primary level.  Given such substantial and welcome population growth, we will have a much-increased enrolment at all levels of education.  The latter is expected to continue in the medium term.  It is vital, therefore, that there is sufficient school accommodation to cope with these pupil enrolments.  In order to meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the Department must establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.<\/p><p>The five-year plan announced in March 2012 outlines the major school projects that are due to proceed to construction over the duration of the plan, including the new 1,000-pupil post-primary school for Gorey.  This represents a major advance in how the school building programme is publicised and provides certainty to patrons and school communities concerning the major school building projects that the Department is in a position to progress.  Those schools included in the five-year plan now know when their projects will proceed to construction.  This will facilitate schools in planning to meet the educational needs of children in their areas.<\/p><p>The new permanent post-primary school building in Gorey is currently under construction.  Due, however, to the immediate demand for additional post-primary school places in the town, it was necessary to establish the new school in a temporary location pending the construction of the permanent building.  The new school opened in September 2011 and provides accommodation for up to 300 pupils.  The design of the building lends itself to conversion to a permanent primary school in the future if required.  In addition, the specialist accommodation, which is of a temporary nature, could potentially be relocated to another post-primary school facility if required.  The most recent projections produced by the Department of Education and Skills in respect of the Gorey area forecast an increase in demand at primary level in the coming years.  A decision on the future use of the building in question, currently occupied by the temporary post-primary school, will be taken when construction of the new school is completed and will be considered in the context of how best to meet future education demand in the area.<\/p><p>I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600055#DDD00300","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1362596100,"counter":432,"content":"<p>So the politburo is alive and well.

One such regulation is EU Regulation 181\/2011, which deals with the issue of disability access to public transport, specifically, coaches and buses and so forth.  To be frank, if this issue had been dealt with by previous Governments, when new equipment was bought over the past couple of decades, we would have a far more accessible bus network now.  I travel on Bus \u00c9ireann.  There is nothing as bad as seeing a wheelchair-user trying to navigate the steps of a bus in this day and age.  Improvements should have been made in the period of the Celtic tiger.<\/p><p>I have raised on numerous occasions in this House the fact that there is no wheelchair lift in Ennis railway station, even though in excess of \u20ac100 million was spent on building the western rail corridor which is not being used to the degree any of us would like it to be used.  I have been looking for a wheelchair lift to be installed in Ennis railway station since this Government took office. <\/p><p>The Minister of State is a very sincere Minister and is one of the more proactive junior Ministers.  I know he has made significant headway with initiatives such as the Leap card and the digital signage showing real time traffic information but access for those with a disability needs to be improved.  These issues are covered by legislation in the United States, for example, where access is regarded as a right.  This attitude has not percolated through to Europe, as yet.  I suspect there is an attempt at EU level to try to introduce that type of scenario.  Obviously, I am more cognisant than anyone else of the dire economic circumstances in which the country finds itself.  I have to say to those with disabilities that just like every other group in society they have to be patient and realistic in what can be achieved.  However, where it is possible to spend money, there is an onus of responsibility to ensure it is spent.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the provision of certain basic facilities, such as a lift in Ennis railway station.  No more than Senator D'Arcy, I thank the Acting Chairman for her indulgence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600056#EEE00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1362596700,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Senator Conway is a gentleman whom I know well.

I will keep the Senator informed of developments in that regard.  The matter has been raised previously in the House.  I assure the Senator that I will be in touch with him.<\/p><p>I refer to the principal issue raised by Senator Conway.  Regulation (EU) 181\/2011, which came into effect on 1 March 2013, provides for a minimum set of rights for passengers travelling on bus and coach services within the European Union.  The regulation applies in the main to regular services.  These are services provided at specified intervals along specified routes with passengers being picked up and set down at predetermined stopping points, where the boarding or alighting point of the passengers is situated in the territory of a member state.  Some rights are also prescribed for occasional or non-scheduled services<\/p><p>Besides the general passenger rights available under the EU regulation, disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility have specified rights when using regular bus and coach services, in order to allow them to enjoy the same possibilities to travel and to have the same rights as other people, including: the right to access to transport for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility at no additional cost; the right to special assistance; and the right to compensation for loss of or damage to mobility equipment.<\/p><p>With regard to the right to special assistance under Article 13 of the EU regulation, in the case of long-distance regular services, those services exceeding 250 km, carriers and terminal management bodies must provide, within their respective areas of competence, assistance free of charge to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.<\/p><p>Disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility must notify the carrier about their specific needs, at the latest 36 hours before the assistance is needed.  They must present themselves at the designated point of the bus terminal at the agreed time before the departure time.  This cannot be more than 60 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time.  <\/p><p>The regulation provides for member states to apply an exemption for domestic regular services over 250 km from certain aspects of the EU regulation, including significant elements of the chapter relating to the rights of persons with reduced mobility.  In addition, for services of lesser distance than 250 km, an exemption can be sought under the EU regulation with regard to disability awareness training for drivers and other personnel, for a period of time.<\/p><p>My Department last year consulted directly with stakeholders on the application of the EU regulation, which included both consumer groups and the bus and coach industry.  From the responses received there was broad support for full application of the EU regulation which would promote a better service for people with disabilities and reduced mobility.  Therefore, no exemptions will be applied to the application of the EU regulations in the State.  Following consultation between my Department and the Department for Regional Development in Northern Ireland, there is a common understanding between the authority in Northern Ireland and the Department that the full suite of rights under the EU regulation should apply to cross-Border bus and coach services from 1 March 2013.<\/p><p>Under Article 25 of the EU regulation there is an obligation on all carriers and terminal managing bodies to ensure that passengers, including people with disability and reduced mobility, are provided with appropriate and comprehensible information concerning their rights under the EU regulation.  At the request of a disabled person or person with reduced mobility, the information must be provided, where feasible, in an accessible format.  It is envisaged that the National Transport Authority, NTA, will be designated as the national enforcement body for the purposes of the EU regulation.  The NTA will have responsibility for administration of a system of complaints and enforcement with regard to compliance with the EU regulation.  I intend making regulations in this regard soon.  Comprehensive information concerning the full extent of the EU regulation is being made available on my Department's website.  It is intended that all bus and coach operators will be contacted directly concerning their responsibilities in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013030600056#EEE00500","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1362596700,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the detailed, comprehensive and positive reply, as always.
