There are about five pages of response, containing very helpful information.  The problem is that I have just received the answers now and the witnesses are due to appear before the committee in a few minutes.

By way of information, if members have not had an opportunity, the Data Protection Commission made a determination and there is an option, if the Oireachtas or the Committee of Public Accounts wishes, to appeal that decision.  The recommendation is to accept the decision and that there be no appeal.  The procedures that they highlighted have been improved in the meantime.<\/p> <p>  The next item is statement of accounts received from the last meeting.  There is one statement of accounts, which is from Sport Ireland.  It is a clear audit opinion.

Everybody has agreed to this.  When the representatives have their opening statement made, they will be free to attend their other meetings.  If something arises during the course of the day that is relevant to the Medical Council, we can send a letter to the witnesses seeking a subsequent response in writing.<\/p><p>The witnesses at this meeting have all made themselves available at short notice.  I am thankful for their assistance in this regard.<\/p><p>I remind everybody to turn off all mobile phones.  That means turning them to airplane mode because merely putting them on silent is not enough; it will interfere with the recording of the proceedings.<\/p><p>I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 indicating that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee members clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol that has been circulated.  <\/p><p>Viewers should note that since this controversy arose a number of weeks ago, on 2 May, this is the seventh meeting in the Oireachtas on the matter.  The Joint Committee on Health held three meetings, on 2 May, 9 May and 16 May.  The Committee of Public Accounts held meetings on 10 May and yesterday, 16 May, and it is holding one today, 17 May.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach held a meeting on 8 May with the State Claims Agency.  That amounts to seven meetings.  In the course of those seven meetings, we have heard from seven people from the Department of Health, 15 from the HSE, including those at today's meeting, four people from the State Claims Agency, two from the Medical Council, and one from National Cancer Registry Ireland.  Yesterday, we were joined by Ms Vicky Phelan, Mr. Stephen Teap, and Mr. Cian O'Carroll.  Therefore, 32 people have been present at the seven meetings since 2 May.  We know we put enormous pressure on the witnesses.  Many people have had to attend multiple meetings and we recognise they have other work to do dealing with this issue, but the work of Oireachtas committees is very important to the public interest.  People want to hear these matters spoken about and dealt with here.  I acknowledge the discussions will move to another forum in due course but I wanted to put on record the number of meetings in case people were interested.<\/p><p>I ask Mr. Prasifka to make his opening statement.  He will be free to attend his other meeting afterwards.  If issues arise during the course of the meeting relevant to the Medical Council we can send any questions to it in writing for a response thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#L00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526544000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman very much for inviting us and for his consideration of our other commitments.  It is the last meeting in the five-year term of the Medical Council.  I will not read the opening statement but simply refer to a few highlights.  The Medical Council was established under the Medical Practitioners Act.  We operate under that legislation.  We are the regulator of medical practitioners.  That is our exclusive remit.<br\/><br\/>I want to touch on two of our particular statutory responsibilities that are relevant to the work of the committee.  The first is that we are responsible for giving the practitioners professional guidance.  The practice has been that each council, during its term, will revise and update the guide to professional conduct and ethics.  This council fulfilled that responsibility two years ago by issuing the eighth edition of the guide.  The guide deals specifically with the issue of open disclosure.  The provisions on open disclosure were arrived at by the ethics committee.  I am here with the chairman of that committee.  The provisions on open disclosure were arrived at following a complete consultation with all relevant parties.  It takes place in the context of an ethical guide that views medical care not as something delivered passively to a patient but as something in respect of which the patient is a full participant.  The relationship is really a partnership between the patient and doctor.  The particular provisions on open disclosure, which were significantly updated and expanded upon in the previous guide, are well worth noting.  The ethics guide states: <\/p><blockquote>Open disclosure is supported within a culture of candour.  You have a duty to promote and support this culture and to support colleagues whose actions are investigated following an adverse event. If you are responsible for conducting such investigations, you should make sure they are carried out quickly, recognising that this is a stressful time for all concerned.<\/blockquote> <p>I simply refer the committee to our provisions on open disclosure.<br\/><br\/>We have another very important role, that is, to handle complaints that are made against doctors.  There were certain questions that were put to us about how that is done.  The Medical Practitioners Act is very explicit and sets out very precise procedures that must be followed when complaints are made.  The practitioner who is subject to a complaint is entitled to full constitutional protections.  There are very elaborate procedures put in place.  All matters are put before the practitioner, who has a full opportunity to deal with whatever complaints are made.  The investigation is a confidential investigation under the Act.  The sanctions, at their most severe, can include an erasure and someone being taken off the register, and they can also include a suspension, whereby one is taken off the register for a period of time.  There is also censure, admonishment and advice.  Also, conditions can be put on a practitioner's ability to practice.  These can include updating their skills, reporting to a mentor and engaging in supervised practice until the medical practitioner believes the problem has been remedied.  What I must emphasise to the committee is that it is extremely important that we, as the regulator in this area, never prejudge any issue.  We cannot come before the committee and say a doctor in a certain circumstance would receive a certain outcome.  We cannot talk about individual cases but what we can do is expand upon the general principles that are in the ethics guide.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman again for inviting us.  I also thank him for recognising our particular circumstances today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka"},{"type":"speech","time":1526544000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Prasifka.

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Tony Holohan, chief medical officer.<br\/><br\/>I know the committee had the privilege of hearing at first hand from Ms Vicky Phelan and Mr. Stephen Teap last night.  Their brave testimony over recent days, and that of other women and families, has raised profound questions for the way the national cervical screening programme, and the health service generally, engages with people.  They have been willing to speak publicly about deeply personal matters.  In doing so, they have drawn attention to their experience in the hope that this will lead to change.  At the very heart of that change must be how the health service engages with individuals when things go wrong.<br\/><br\/>The CervicalCheck programme was established to help prevent cervical cancer.  Before it was introduced we were not making any impact on cervical cancer but following its introduction we are seeing a steady reduction each year.  However, every time a cervical cancer is not prevented it is a tragedy.  That is compounded when women who have been diagnosed with cancer are not properly informed of the results of a subsequent audit.  I would particularly like to acknowledge the powerful and deeply generous nature of the advice given when a woman who has such a painful experience encourages others to continue to participate in the programme in the interests of their health.<br\/><br\/>These powerful testimonies place on all of us a responsibility to act to address weaknesses while sustaining the national cervical cancer screening programme in the interests of current and future generations of Irish women.  The Department is committed to discharging its particular responsibility to take the necessary steps, in association with the Health Service Executive, HSE, health professionals and others, to restore the trust of women in the CervicalCheck programme and, indeed, in our health service more generally.<br\/><br\/>Last week, the Government commissioned a leading UK expert, Dr. Gabriel Scally, to conduct an inquiry to establish the facts and to review all aspects of CervicalCheck.  We are determined to do everything we can to assist Dr. Scally in his inquiries so that we can all find out what happened, and why it happened, to make sure that we have a robust cancer screening programme for women, and that lessons are learned for the future.<br\/><br\/>However, the focus needs to be on the women most affected as well as the CervicalCheck programme.  On Friday last, the Government agreed a comprehensive package of health and social care measures to support the 209 women and their families who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer and whose audit result differed from their original smear test.  The Government has committed to ensuring that these women and their families are supported to the fullest extent possible.  The HSE nationally and locally is implementing these support arrangements and will be in a position to update the committee.<br\/><br\/>The health and social care measures include a discretionary medical card for each woman affected, or their next of kin in cases where the woman has sadly died, so that they can all avail of health services, including medicines provided under the medical card scheme, free of charge; out-of-pocket medical costs incurred, including the cost of any medicines which have been prescribed by their treating clinician; primary care supports, including counselling for the women affected and counselling for the immediate family members of these women, including bereavement counselling, where needed; and other health and social care supports, including travel costs and child-minding.<br\/><br\/>An international clinical expert review panel is also being established.  The main purpose of the panel is to provide women with facts and independent expert assessment of those facts.  The panel&rsquo;s findings will also contribute to the overall independent assessment of the quality of the CervicalCheck programme.<br\/><br\/>The review will consider in depth all cases of invasive cervical cancer in Ireland since CervicalCheck was established.  Women who developed cancer and who were screened by CervicalCheck will be identified and their screening histories will be examined.  The expert panel will review the cases of those women who have had previous screening tests prior to their diagnosis and undertake a re-examination of cytology tests.  Where the expert panel opinion of cytology results differs from the original results provided by CervicalCheck, the panel will endeavour to determine, wherever possible, any failures to prevent cancer or to intervene at an earlier stage.  The panel will prepare individual reports for those affected, setting out the facts and their independent assessment.<br\/><br\/>The Government has also announced that the State Claims Agency is advancing a new initiative aimed at expediting resolution of the nine outstanding legal cases in a sensitive manner utilising mediation wherever possible.<br\/><br\/>In addition, last week, the Minister for Health received Government approval to provide in law for mandatory open disclosure, through the forthcoming patient safety Bill, in respect of serious patient safety incidents such as these.  The Bill will also provide for mandatory reporting of these serious events to the appropriate regulatory authority, such as the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  Policy on open disclosure has been informed by a number of elements, including the experiences of other comparable countries and the Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality, the Madden report.<br\/><br\/>The open disclosure provisions brought forward last year were based on the principles set out in the Madden report.  These proposals were also subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Health.  This legislation has since been enacted, following the passage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, and regulations flowing from it are due to be brought forward shortly.  This approach is intended to help create a positive climate for open disclosure and to support the HSE&rsquo;s national policy on open disclosure.<br\/><br\/>At no time has the Department of Health viewed open disclosure as something which clinicians or health service staff should regard as optional.  It is quite clear that there is an expectation that patients should be told about any incidents regarding their care that may have occurred.  This is clearly the standard expected in the HSE&rsquo;s national policy on open disclosure<i><\/i>and the requirements of the Medical Council for doctors, as we have just heard.<br\/><br\/>Like many health services internationally, we are seeking to achieve a health service where the relationship with patients is open, honest, listening and supportive.  While progress in introducing such an approach has been made, this should be the everyday ethos of the health service.  In this context, it is recognised that there are a number of very serious incidents where it is appropriate to introduce a requirement in law for mandatory open disclosure.  That is why provisions for mandatory open disclosure will be incorporated into the forthcoming patient safety Bill, which will also provide for mandatory reporting of serious patient safety incidents to HIQA and others.  The drafting of the patient safety Bill is being undertaken as a matter of priority within the Department.<br\/><br\/>The Department recognises the overriding importance of patient safety and quality in the delivery of health services and the need to ensure that all that can be done to prevent harm and error is done.  The Department established the National Patient Safety Office 18 months ago and a range of important initiatives are under way on which we will be happy to provide further details.  For example, the general scheme of the patient safety (licensing) Bill, which was approved by Government in December 2017 and referred to the Oireachtas, will ensure the need for all hospitals to have strong clinical governance and patient safety operating frameworks in place in order to be granted and maintain a licence to provide health services.<br\/><br\/>On Tuesday, the Department published records relating to the CervicalCheck clinical audit.  The information submitted by the HSE in regard to this audit in 2016 provided the Department with an understanding that this was a retrospective clinical audit undertaken for quality assurance and learning purposes and that CervicalCheck had a clear objective to provide results to consultants in order to allow for direct communication with the women concerned.  Both clinical audit and communication of the results of clinical audit to women were seen by the Department to be very worthy and valuable undertakings by the CervicalCheck programme.  Clinical audit is an important means by which standards are maintained and advances made in healthcare.<br\/><br\/>I believe that a reasonable approach was taken by the Department at the time based upon the information available to it.  There are two ways of looking at issues - based upon the information available at the time or with hindsight.  Of course, had the subsequent widespread non-disclosure been escalated by CervicalCheck within the HSE and raised with the Department, this would have triggered a major concern and a much different attitude but based upon the information we had, we viewed the initiative taken to communicate audit findings to women in a positive light.<br\/><br\/>Let me be clear.  The Department did not know about widespread non-disclosure of audit results.  This has been confirmed by the HSE.  Had we done so, that would have been escalated immediately.  When we did become aware in April 2018, we immediately escalated the issue and worked with the HSE to put in place a serious incident management team to manage the response.<\/p><p> The widespread and still unfolding distress caused by the non-disclosure of the clinical audit results to the women concerned demands serious reflection.  The Scally inquiry provides us with a mechanism to get an objective basis for introducing improvements where these can be identified.  Those improvements will be introduced.  However, some areas for improvement can already be recognised.  As I set out last week, we will work with the HSE to review its open disclosure policy and the implementation of same in light of the experience to date.  We will incorporate within the drafting of the patient safety Bill a mechanism to develop and introduce national standards for clinical audit.  These standards will ensure that open disclosure, including roles and responsibilities for such disclosure, are fully addressed in advance of the commencement of an audit.  As the CervicalCheck experience shows, it is important to anticipate the issues that will arise for the disclosure of clinical audit findings before commencing the process.  The clinical audit standards to be introduced under the patient safety Bill should also entail a responsibility to record the fact that open disclosure has taken place.<\/p><p> I look forward to the recommendations produced by the Scally inquiry.  The inquiry will produce an interim report at the start of June and a final report by the end of that month.  The Department's role will be subject to detailed scrutiny by the inquiry.  The committee can be assured that we will provide full support and co-operation and address any learning and recommendation as a matter of priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526544000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Breslin.

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting with my colleagues.<\/p> <p>  At the Joint Committee on Health yesterday, I acknowledged and apologised for the confusion and alarm caused regarding the CervicalCheck programme as a result of the failure to communicate with the women affected.  For the record of this committee, I wish to restate this acknowledgement and apology.  The failures, particularly those related to the non-disclosure of essential information, have ultimately impacted on every female in Ireland as well as women's families, spouses and children.  Irrespective of the original well-intentioned undertaking by the CervicalCheck programme to conduct an audit of invasive cervical cancers and communicate the results to the patients affected, the organisation - in that respect, I mean both the HSE and CervicalCheck - failed by any measure.<\/p> <p>  I have listened to the words of the many brave individuals who have spoken publicly about their situations over the past numbers of weeks, including Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap at this committee yesterday.  I reassure them that I am listening intently.  Vicky Phelan commented yesterday that she was there to see change.  I reassure her, the other families involved in this and the women of Ireland that I am determined that we will take on board all the lessons learned from this unacceptable chain of events.  Together with my colleagues, we will work to bring about the changes with a view to ensuring that this does not happen again.<\/p> <p>  CervicalCheck is vital to women's health and we must clearly understand the mistakes that have been made and how we can learn from these and restore confidence in this life-saving public health programme.  That will involve working closely with the Government and the Department of Health in order to put in place all necessary improvements in terms of governance and accountability.  Many of these aspects were covered in the testimony of Vicky and Stephen last night.<\/p> <p>  In the short time that I have been interim director general, I have asked for a full record search and a full chronology of events to be compiled.  That exercise in detail is now under way.  It will involve conducting a forensic and extensive review of emails and is preparation, not just for the work of the inquiries made by Dr. Scally, but for any subsequent inquiry.<\/p> <p>  Last week, the HSE provided a number of briefing notes at short notice to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have submitted them again to this committee.  Regrettably, there was not sufficient opportunity at last week's meeting to provide appropriate context and interpretation of these briefing notes.  I have brought colleagues to this meeting who will be prepared to answer any question on the details of the notes.  The notes were also discussed in some detail yesterday by the Joint Committee on Health.  It is fair to say that the language in all the briefing notes is very functional and somewhat lacking in empathy for the women who were to be communicated to.  At that time, the intent of the CervicalCheck programme was that all treating clinicians would be given individual audit findings for their patients so that these in turn could be communicated to the women concerned in line with the then guidelines.<\/p> <p>  A key element within the March 2016 briefing was the assurance it gave that there was no systemic quality issue of concern with the programme.  This is the most important element of any audit from a cancer prevention and effectiveness perspective, namely, to provide assurance that there is nothing systematically happening in the screening programme and its operations that would lead to it operating outside of internationally acceptable quality parameters, for example, the European guidelines.  However, this is an aspect that will be examined very closely by the Scally review and, indeed, informed by the work of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.<\/p> <p>  The process involved sending audit results to treating clinicians in order that these results could be communicated to the women concerned in line with the relevant guidelines.  The CervicalCheck programme had commenced sending letters to treating clinicians in February 2016.  All individuals briefed on it expected that the women affected would be receiving information from their treating clinicians on the result of the audit findings pertinent to their cases.<\/p> <p>  The subject matter of the March 2016 briefing was to provide a snapshot of the process to date and to escalate a particular issue at hand.  The issue concerned one laboratory - Quest Diagnostics - that challenged the CervicalCheck programme's communications process with treating clinicians and, as part of its contract, invoked a dispute resolution process.  CervicalCheck and the National Screening Service requested support to resolve it.  I have been advised in my new role that this is why \"Pause all letters\" was listed as a next step in the briefing.  At that point, it was believed to be imperative that CervicalCheck and the National Screening Service resolve this issue so as to ensure the former had solid legal footing to continue with its work in sending audit findings to treating clinicians for onward disclosure to the women concerned, within the guidelines set out.  If CervicalCheck had continued sending letters without the assurance that it had legal cover to do so, it could have created subsequent legal issues for the operation of the programme, in addition to any potential risk for any woman seeking redress, where the laboratory could claim its legal rights and entitlements had been infringed by the process.  This is why \"Await advice of solicitors\" was one of the next steps outlined in the briefing note from March 2016.<\/p> <p>  CervicalCheck was supported in resolving the dispute with Quest Diagnostics and the process of issuing letters to treating clinicians recommenced in June 2016.  During the time it took to resolve the dispute, CervicalCheck was preparing individual letters for each patient case history to send to treating clinicians.  The briefing note of March 2016 reads: \"The specific issue is that there is now a batch\/accumulation of clinical audit case reports that have been completed.\"  It was understood by those who were briefed that these case reports needed to be converted into individual letters in respect of each patient concerned.  Correspondence demonstrates that this work was happening at the time.  This correspondence will be made available to the scoping inquiry in full detail.<\/p> <p>  CervicalCheck explained in the briefings how the audit and communications process was complex, multilayered and resource intensive.  They made clear to those being briefed that each communication needed to be specific to the individual and checked and rechecked for accuracy relating to the specifics of each patient, and the logistics of sending these communications needed to be carefully thought through so as to mitigate any risk relating to the manner, mode, content and logistics of that communication.  This is why \"Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks\" was set out as a next step in the briefing note.  It is important to note that CervicalCheck issued the majority of the correspondence - approximately 200 letters - during July and August 2016.<\/p> <p>  We need to be realistic in an assessment of the communication process.  The CervicalCheck programme did not effectively close out the issues that were subsequently encountered regarding the breakdown in the process of treating clinicians discussing audit findings with their patients.  Indeed, it is not clear to me that the staff within the programme were aware of the scale of the difficulty in terms of the proportion of women who had not been communicated with.<\/p> <p>  It is also important in our consideration of the programme that we look at some key facts.  Most women's smear test results are accurately reported.  Every year, some 270,000 smears are undertaken.  For women who have received a normal result, the chance of going on to have cancer by their next smear test three years later is less than 1%.<\/p><p>Since 2008, the programme has provided 3 million cervical screenings to more than 1 million women, and has detected in excess of 50,000 high grade precancerous changes in women, reducing their risk of cervical cancer by 90%.  These were women without any symptoms who, without the screening programme, would not have known that they had precancerous changes.  Latest figures, which are very welcome, show that the incidence of cancer in Ireland has reduced by 7% in the period 2010 to 2015.  This means that fewer women have developed cancer and hundreds of lives have been saved.<\/p><p> Can I take the opportunity, in moving towards closure, to say a few words in support of our national audit programme?  The process of clinical audit is about measuring the quality of care against relevant standards and best professional practice.  It encompasses the requirement to identify any factors causing suboptimal delivery of care, either at an individual patient level or more widely, and allows the necessary remedial actions to be identified and taken.  In light of the controversy over the CervicalCheck audit, we must ensure that healthcare professionals are not discouraged from taking part in clinical audit.  We need to foster an open culture which supports clinicians and encourages learning, and that must be part of our ethos.<\/p><p> At this point it might also be useful for me to say a word or two about accountability.  To me, personally, accountability is the obligation for an organisation or individual to account for its, his or her activities, to accept responsibility for them, and to disclose the results in a transparent manner.  As interim director general, it might be useful to outline how I see myself discharging these duties against the obligation to be accountable to the Minister and more generally.  As part of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013, which established the directorate as the governing body of the HSE, the directorate is accountable to the Minister for the performance of its functions and those of the HSE.  As the interim director general, I account to the Minister, on behalf of the directorate, through the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  It is important that we foster a culture of openness and transparency and of personal and organisational accountability in doing so.<\/p><p> The process and procedures for how the CervicalCheck programme intended to communicate the results of the audit to patients was developed at that time with the best of intentions and with a view to ensuring that women would receive the results of the audit, consistent with policy and best practice as set out in the 2015 open disclosure national policy and informed by wider best practice for the disclosure of cancer screening audit results.  The failure, and it is a collective failure, was on ensuring effective follow-through with these good intentions.  In common parlance, we did not adequately close the loop.  While the results of the audit were communicated to the relevant clinicians, the arrangements thereafter appear to have broken down.  The outcome was that a large proportion of women were not told about either the audit itself or the results for them as individuals.  The impact of this failure, as I have said, has been profound both for every single woman affected and their families.  This caused significant levels of fear and anxiety for the wider population of women living in Ireland and it has, sadly, undermined public confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.<\/p><p> I would like to conclude my opening statement with the following pledges.  First and number one, we will move swiftly and with compassion to provide effective support packages to the women and families who require that  support.  We will do that with the minimum of fuss and bureaucracy and with empathy.  Contact started yesterday with those affected, and we will conclude that in the next few days.  We will provide, through each community healthcare organisation, a single point of contact to make access as easy as possible for those affected.<\/p><p> Second, we will fully, transparently and openly co-operate with the Scally inquiry, the international expert panel review and any subsequent inquiries.  Third, I am aware of the testimony given by both Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap yesterday to this committee.  If there is a requirement to hold individuals to account on a personal basis, we will do so.  In that respect, the Scally inquiry and subsequent inquiries will be important for the independence of their views and to allow due process and fair procedures to be followed.  We will learn lessons from recent weeks, not least the ability to say sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526544000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Before I call the various speakers, I wish to raise one issue with Mr. Breslin concerning his opening statement and the one topic of open disclosure.

Across the board, all countries are moving increasingly towards the type of relationship that Bill Prasifka outlined as the model that we want to implement.  Change does take some time to embed within a professional organisation.  The policy that has been there since 2013, and evidence was given last week on some audits about how well it has been implemented, has made significant difference to how doctors and clinicians approach patients, but we have not got it 100% there and there is a lot of work still to do.  The work that was done in last year's civil liability Bill was to create the type of supportive environment for everybody involved in that disclosure to feel that they could do it without a consequence for doing it, to be able to admit, say what went wrong and deal with the consequence of that, but without the very act of telling somebody being used against them.  That was an important thing to address what is a fear among the medical profession in different countries, which is a medico-legal fear that something will subsequently come against them in terms of their professional legal standing.  We dealt with that last year.<\/p> <p>  The next bit that we are going to deal with is in respect of serious events, because there are a range of issues that arise within the health services which are routine, which do not involve harm, but which are sufficient in terms of being an incident to require attention for the future.  In respect of serious incidents, we will now have a position in place where it is mandatory and it is required under law that that happen.  That will be a further step forward in making sure that, in cases such as this, it does happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1526544000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I cannot accept that answer as I do not think it is adequate.  Mr. Breslin specifically said, in relation to open disclosure, that the matter was dealt with last year by way of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, to which I am sure he was referring.  This committee has been dealing with this issue and the State Claims Agency for quite a considerable period.  I will display on the screen the letter that we received from the HSE on 8 February 2018 specifically dealing with open disclosure.  I will read one paragraph from the letter because I do not believe that the matter has been dealt with at all by the Department.  I refer to PAC No. 1075B, dated 8 February 2018.  There was a substantial document from the HSE about open disclosure with which Mr. Breslin will be familiar.  Let us look at near the end of the last page of the letter from the HSE that deals with legislation.  The letter was written to the committee on 8 February of this year.  The letter reads, &quot;One of the main barriers to open disclosure identified in the independent evaluation of the national programme is fear of litigation.&quot;  Mr. Breslin has just said that and he said that he had dealt with that.  The letter continues:<\/p><blockquote>This is a barrier which is identified in many international studies.  This has now been addressed in part 4 of the Civil Liability Amendment Act 2017 which provides protective provisions for staff when they engage in open disclosure in that the disclosure and any apology provided cannot be used as an admission of liability in a court of law.  This will have a significant impact when commenced [I emphasise that the last two words are &quot;when commenced&quot;.] in relation to increasing the confidence of staff when engaging in open disclosure discussions with patients\/service users.<\/blockquote> <p>This committee received the letter on 8 February.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health immediately after we received the letter, on 27 February, asking when section 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 would be commenced, and if the Minister would make a statement on the matter.  Part 4 of the Act is headed &quot;Open Disclosure of Patient Safety Incidents&quot;.  Therefore, we are talking about Part 4 of the Act.  The reply to my parliamentary question reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment ) Act 2017 which provides for the voluntary open disclosure of patient safety incidents was signed into law in November 2017.<br \/><br \/>Work has commenced on the drafting of Regulations to accompany Part 4 of the Act.  Consultation with the various stakeholders including the Health Service Executive, HIQA and the Regulators is underway.  It is intended to commence Part 4 in the near future.<\/blockquote><p>More than three months ago, we were told it was intended to commence Part 4 in the near future.  Those provisions on open disclosure that the Secretary General referred to in the Act, passed by the Oireachtas on 22 November 2017, have not commenced.  This week, the Minister stated in the D&aacute;il during the debate on this topic, &ldquo;The legislation to provide for a voluntary approach to open disclosure has been enacted following the passage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 and regulations flowing from it are due to be brought forward shortly.&rdquo;  The Secretary General's said here today, &ldquo;This legislation has since been enacted, following the passage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, and regulations flowing from it are due to be brought forward shortly.&rdquo;  Six months after legislation was passed, the Department of Health has not brought forward the regulations to commence the legislation which was passed by the Oireachtas on 22 November 2017.<\/p><p> Will the Department take me through the steps of who is working on this and at what stage of preparation are these regulations?  Without these regulations, we have no open disclosure.  The HSE has my sympathy being caught in this bind.  It has had a national policy of open disclosure from 2013 but it cannot implement it because the Department has not given it the legislative framework to do so.  The Secretary General stated today that is why provisions for mandatory open disclosure will be incorporated into the forthcoming patient safety Bill.  How about implementing the legislation we passed six months ago?  The Department should not talk to us about what it is going to do in the future when it is sitting on legislation for six months which it has not yet implemented.  The HSE and the clinicians are in a bind and are no better off with the passage of this legislation.  Why has there been a delay?  As Chairman of this committee, I have been on this case with letters, parliamentary questions, opening statements and Minister's statements.  They say it is all going to be done in the near future and shortly.  Who in the Department has been working actively on these regulations to allow open disclosure to have any effect?  How close is the Department to having this matter concluded?  It is wishful thinking to be talking about the next batch of legislation when Department has not implemented the last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#O00600","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526544000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>We are going to do both.

We heard reference earlier to the 2016 guidelines.  The obligation on each individual medical practitioner is set out clearly and unambiguously and makes it clear their absolute obligation regarding open disclosure.  What we are seeking to do is to reinforce both the implementation of that and the open disclosure policy of the HSE with something we know will tackle the pervasive culture which exists internationally in terms of fear of litigation.  This will help to support the creation of the right kind of space.  We want to ensure that when things go wrong, rather than retreating from patients, doctors will support patients actively through that without fear that an apology and engaging with patients will create risks for them.<\/p> <p>  Our experience has been of patient safety incidents.  These have been written up and described by us in the Department.  We found that at that very moment of harm, doctors, sometimes through fear, step away from patients at the very moment they need help and support.  Accordingly, trust and confidence in the service and practitioner is lost.  The purpose of this is to create and maintain that safe space.  Open disclosure is not the ticking of a box or the filling of a form.  It is supporting a patient through a journey of beginning to understand what happened, maintenance of confidence in that service and beginning to adjust to what in some situations could be life-altering or life-limiting findings.  It cannot be just a tick-box culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526544000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I understand that is the process involved.

For a lot of people in this room the witnesses have failed in that duty.  Some of the information we did not get and stuff that was not said last week at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts shows a clear lack of duty of candour.  I will put all my questions very respectfully, but I am very angry at some people in this room.  I am sure most of them will have seen the hearing yesterday when we heard from Vicky and Stephen.  We heard from Vicky's legal representative as well.  He talked about a co-ordinated, premeditated, orchestrated strategy to minimise the volume of women who would be informed of the results of their smear.  That is what happened, in my view.<\/p> <p>  When I heard the two Accounting Officers read their opening statements today, I heard a lot of hollow words from both of them.  Mr. Connaghan said that if there is a requirement to hold people to account on the basis of their individual performances, this will be done.  There is such a requirement and some of those people are in this room.  We will put those questions to them today.  There are people in this room who have questions to answer, who have failed those women, and we have a duty to put the questions to them.  We will do so robustly and fairly but we do so with anger as well.  We are representing those women and also the husbands and partners of women who passed away because of this scandal.<\/p> <p>  In terms of duty of candour, we also requested information which was delivered to the committee late last night.

We received the information about an hour before the meeting was due to commence and we had to suspend the meeting for an hour before we could proceed because of that.  I want to register my disappointment at that.  It is a practice that happened before Mr. Connaghan's time.  We have always expressed our frustration and hoped the practice would stop.  I respectfully request that in future we get the information as quickly as possible to allow us to do our job.<\/p> <p>  Part of the correspondence we got was a minute of a meeting of the CervicalCheck lead colposcopists group on 1 September 2017.  Have the witnesses got that minute in front of them?  Mr Connaghan has.  This was a meeting of what I imagine is the steering group of the CervicalCheck programme.  There were a lot of clinicians there and Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly was there too.  There was a very lengthy discussion about whether women should know.  The minutes state that there was a general consensus that CervicalCheck should let women know prospectively about the process around the time of diagnosis.  It talked about a perception that putting the onus on the clinicians to initiate the conversation was not correct and caused a deal of concern and negative feeling towards the programme on the part of clinicians.  One of the clinicians who was there was Dr. Kevin Hickey, a consultant to Vicky Phelan.  He had previously raised concerns with Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly about informing the patients in cases he had dealt with.  He had been told he should inform only three of the ten patients.  When he asked Dr. Flannelly about this, she said a balance needed to be struck in deciding who needs a formal communication of the outcome of the audit and that the possibility of resultant harm was crucial.  This is what angers and frustrates me.  The response from Dr. Flannelly and the decision that was made at this meeting were astounding.<\/p><p>Dr. Flannelly spoke about producing an information leaflet.  That was the response.  An information leaflet was to be the big solution.

I will be more specific for Mr. Breslin before he comes back in.  <\/p><p>Last week we had a very lengthy discussion on what information the Department had.  While I put my points robustly, fairly and respectfully, I am very angry with the Chief Medical Officer about the fact that we sat here for one and a half hours last week when we had a very lengthy discussion with Mr. Breslin on what information the Department knew about the memos.  There were three memos.  It is not just the memos that were known to the Chief Medical Officer and the Department; there were also seven meetings at which the Department had been represented and not once did the Chief Medical Officer inform this committee that he was aware of the memos or that he had sat in at those meetings.  This was in dereliction of his duty.  I will return to the issue of the Chief Medical Officer shortly, but Mr. Breslin was obviously not made aware either.  Not only was the Minister not made aware, Mr. Breslin was also not made aware.  The memo, referred to in the opening statement, reads:<\/p><blockquote>Pause all letters.<br \/><br \/>Await the advice of solicitors. <\/blockquote> <p>[I imagine that was with regard to the dispute with the laboratory]<\/p><blockquote>Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks. <\/blockquote> <p>[The risks to the HSE]<\/p><blockquote>Continue to prepare reactive communications response for a media headline that &lsquo;screening did not diagnose my cancer&rsquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>That was the context and there were subsequent memos and meetings.

We did not have the specific memos in our documentation that we had pulled together at that stage.  The explanation is the absolute commitment that has been under way on the part of all of the officials in the Department to trying to respond to the immediate issues.  I have put in place a separate process, one that does not involve those officials, to go through the emails within the Department to establish exactly what we knew.  When I sat in at the previous committee meeting, I gave an immediate undertaking because the director general of the HSE had referred to a specific memo from March 2016 that the director general indicated had gone to the Department.  I double checked to see where that memo would have come into the Department.  I was told by the HSE about it.

I am asking what was done in 2016 and subsequently, when there was not just knowledge of the memos but meetings were being held to discuss the strategy to be put in place to give discretion to consultants to reduce the \"volume\" of dispatch.  The memo also stated: \"Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks\".  They were concerned that some of the women would go to the media.  When Mr. Breslin was before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health last week, he said, \"...the judgment made was that it was not, within the gamut of issues being managed across the health service, of sufficient scale.\"   Despite this, the memo referred to concern about the scale and volumes involved.

I had not seen that memo in two years.  I was seeing it for the first time in two years in the same way as the Deputy was seeing it when it was brought to the committee.  What those memos show over that time period, as the Secretary General has set out, was the progression of the issuing of letters over a period of time, with the clear intention of that information being shared with patients.  I would have understood that in the following way.  That was a clinical audit arrangement.  Clinical audit as part of cervical screening only happens in a minority of countries in Europe.

This is like a big jigsaw with the amount of information coming through.  This will be a very difficult day for all the witnesses.  It will probably be one of the most difficult days in their careers, and certainly the most difficult day they will spend here.  I think we will be here for many hours.  I have so many questions and I will not leave here until I have asked them all.  I ask the witnesses to be conscious that their own management across the country and the Minister for Health are watching them.  I expect that we will get answers that are direct, straight and honest.  I agree with the opening sentiments of my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, on information not being provided previously and on the manner in which information was provided to us today.<\/p><p>Vicky Phelan has just tweeted about the drip drip of information, \"This has been the gameplan since the #CervicalCheckScandal broke. Drip feed inflammatory documents fo try to water down the effect of the cover up.\"  These are Vicky Phelan's words at 9.38 a.m. this morning.  She says to me to \"Please take them to task on this and demand answers\".  She says that the documents are to try to water down the effect of the cover up.  I thought that should be read into the record.<\/p><p> I want to start by saying something to the acting director general.  I thought yesterday that we had found somebody who would act in a manner of candour and in a certain way to get information.  I genuinely did but I am concerned about his statement today and how it differentiates from the statement yesterday.  I will tell him why.  At the end of the first document, in point 3, he says \"If there is a requirement to hold individuals to account on a personal basis we will do so.  In that respect the Scally Inquiry and subsequent inquiries will be important\".  It changes today and starts adding in the information relating to Vicky, Stephen and so on.  I would have thought the testimony Mr. Connaghan heard yesterday would have elevated this.  He is aware of the testimony.  Being aware of it is not good enough for me.  This is a live issue.  There are people in Mr. Connaghan's organisation who are responsible for this.  Some of them may sit among us.  When Stephen sat in either Mr. Connaghan's or Mr. McCallion's seat yesterday, he said he did not understand how they were still in place and how they were not stood down because of the impact their management and decision-making had on women in this country.  I think Mr. Connaghan has an opportunity.  We are public representatives but I have gone beyond the politics of this.<\/p><p> I will never forget yesterday's testimony for the rest of my life.  I cried through it.  She said she would not stop over her dead body.  They want and need accountability.  Stephen was very clear on this.  They represent society.  They do not just represent themselves but society.  They go beyond.  They are better representatives than us.  The Irish political system has let these people down.  It is a stain on all our houses.  It is a stain on my party, on Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Independents and Social Democrats.  It does not matter who one is - it is a stain on us all.  There will be the Scally inquiry and I am entirely behind that.  There will be a commission of investigation, as I have said all along.  This is a live issue and there is a huge amount of pressure and responsibility on Mr. Connaghan's shoulders to deal with this issue in an ongoing way.  He will have to make decisions based on the evidence he has heard and the knowledge he has.<\/p><p> I know what is going on in the HSE.  Across the HSE are phone calls, meetings, people going in for cover, verifications of documents, verifications of whether people replied or not.  In the last three or four weeks, most people in this room and many outside of it have been doing all the work except this.  This has been it for the HSE - arse-covering.  That is what is happening.  The responsibility is with Mr. Connaghan.  Our faith has to be with him to deal with this as a live issue.  Bear in mind what Stephen and Vicky said last night, not what we are saying.  We will have questions and will pull out more information.  Please do that because I have not seen it yet.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, is watching this as well and I would ask Simon, who is a very good person, to bear in mind what I just said.  I asked witnesses here yesterday why Mr. Liam Woods and Mr. Patrick Lynch were not able to come.  In fairness to Mr. Woods, he is here.  Mr. Patrick Lynch, on the organisational chart, is the national director for quality assurance and verification.  That is risk and quality assurance.  He was working on Monday.

This is the difficulty I have and this is why I am struggling to get my head around it.  There is a communications strategy in place and the whole purpose of the communications strategy is to try to protect the efficacy of the CervicalCheck programme in the event that women who are taking legal action go public and there are headlines, as per the memorandum.

It did not reach Mr. Breslin.  It did not reach anyone in political circles, for example, the Minister or members of Government.

There is a reference in the March document to the communications strategy being developed between CervicalCheck and the media within the HSE.  I will have to double-check the details because it could be the October document, but one of the questions we asked about was the nature of the public relations interaction between the HSE and the Department of Health.  Our question on that point was answered for today.  That was on the back of the reference in the memorandum to the communications department within the HSE being involved in the drafting of the media strategy.  The answer we have received today is that the HSE has a national director of communications &ndash; the relevant official is before the committee today.  The answer stated that the relevant person in 2016 was Mr. Paul Connors and that Mr. Connors was not involved in discussions on media as per the comment in the memorandums received.  Furthermore, the response stated that he had no knowledge of the matter until 12.50 p.m. on Wednesday, 25 April this year.  Perhaps Mr. Connors can answer this question about the communications division of the HSE.  Who was involved in 2016 in drafting or in discussions around the communications strategy that might be needed if there was an adverse fall-out from this?

Also part of the communications strategy would have been that the people would have had media preparation.  That would be a normal part.  Right across my functions, I have got policy priority programmes in relation to sexual health and child health, and I will make sure that all those people have media training.<\/p> <p>  We have issues arising in relation to preparation.  Our HIV and sexual health leader will have media training.  Not everybody in the organisation at a senior level - Dr. Connors, for example - will be aware of all the media training that I will do with my colleagues when there are significant issues that need to be discussed in public so as to communicate them.  For this particular work, there was, as the Deputy rightly said, an acknowledgement that there was a risk in relation to the effectiveness of the programme and it was putting in place a series of mechanisms to ensure they would be prepared when that inevitably happened.  The shocking, horrendous thing here is that it happened and we did not realise that the issue was going to be that the women were not informed.

Three options were given for informing women and I will return to these.  There was certainly no intention to inform the families of women who had passed away.  That is explicit in the documentation we have and it was attached to their medical files.  In terms of other women, the approach was to inform them of the audit if it was considered appropriate, to do so at the appropriate time, and to ascertain whether it could do more harm than good to inform them.  I presume this means if it would do more harm than good to the women rather than the organisation.  There were, therefore, three different strands for informing women.  In my opinion, there was never an intention to inform every woman because none of the documentation I have seen suggests that was the case.  I will address many of these issues to Mr. Gleeson when I make my second contribution.  It is astonishing that there is a lack of communication between senior management and middle management across all the organisation and people were not  informed.  That is not a coincidence.

With regard to the reliability of any individual test, depending on which literature one reads, it could fail between 10% and 40% of the time.  For one test that is the failure rate.  The success of a programme depends not on reading one smear but on going back three years later, three years later again and three or five years later again, depending on the age of the patient.  It is a cumulative safety net that goes in under the patient.  I agree that one test on its own is okay, but the benefit accumulates the more tests one has.<\/p><p> If we look at the international literature on this, in countries that have advanced screening programmes, many cancers will develop in women who have been appropriately screened.

I remember feeling a sense of concern as to whether they were telling me that there could be some issue that they found as a result of the audits they had done and that there were quite so many.  Within that, I was assured that the results were sound, as Mr. Connaghan and some of my colleagues have answered, and there was nothing within the data within the audit that suggested there was any systemic issue of concern within those findings.

That was resolved within three months so that concern was over.  The final thing from my perspective, which had been escalated to me for me to support in addressing, was to ensure that the historical letters that they had, of which the vast majority were sent over a two-month period in 2016, were actually sent.  The programme assured me then, and the evidence demonstrates that the programme did this, that as new cases were coming in and as the audit findings were being produced, that it would continue to send letters on an ongoing basis, on a scale of about four to six per month.

The witness referred to a memorandum seeking to disclose, yet this is a memorandum that used language referring to preparing reactive communications for media headlines that \"screening did not diagnose my cancer\".

She calmly put her position that screening did not diagnose her cancer.<\/p> <p>  In many of their opening contributions, members of the committee prefaced their remarks by stating how angry they were coming to the meeting this morning.  I am willing to bet that their anger is not just the result of this hearing but of cumulative hearings with the HSE and the Department of Health in which we have dealt with issues such as the Grace case, and the former director general appeared before the committee to deal with that, and how a communication problem exists.  It is an ongoing thing.  It is not just this case.  In my two years in the Oireachtas I have never encountered another section of Government that finds communicating so difficult.  Mr. Breslin stated that the women who have gone public have drawn attention to their experience in the hope of change.  He probably also heard Vicky Phelan say in her concluding remarks last night that in the past few weeks, they have not seen evidence that there is a culture that indicates a willingness to change.<\/p><p>In fact, she said she would not have been here, that she would have been at home with her two kids, if she thought there was a willingness to change.  Again, I go back to the fact that the witnesses are saying these people's evidence is being very brave, but they came before the committee last night and said they do not believe the HSE and they do not see that willingness.  There is therefore obviously some disconnect.  I keep going back to the people impacted because they, not any of us, are the people living with this.  There are people within a management structure who have the self-awareness that people should be notified or, more worryingly, the self-awareness that people should not be notified.  How is the HSE going to assuage people's fears that there is no willingness to change?

However, this goes to the root of the problem.  It was a reverse process.  They had to reach out.  There was no one picking up the phone to them, and it was disingenuous to say there had been contact.  Dr. O'Keeffe herself said they had to reach out.

I was reflecting on both the March memo and the October memo, at the end of page 2 of which it is stated to me that there is a legal case proceeding at that particular time and &quot;In addition, four letters from legal representatives of women seeking copies of all medical records have been received.&quot;  It is clear, by the way, across all these memos that CervicalCheck has always furnished women with their medical records whenever they have requested them.  The memo goes on to say:<\/p><blockquote>Two of these requests relate to women recently diagnosed, with the programme only having just initiated the cancer audit process in these cases.  Two women have directly enquired informally about their diagnosis and have been informed of the cancer audit process and that any review findings will be communicated to their consultant doctors.<\/blockquote> <p>Therefore, to answer the initial part of the Deputy's question, it is clear that the clinical director of CervicalCheck did reach out and directly talk to women, so the answer there is not a zero.<br\/><br\/>To respond to the other part of the Deputy's question regarding the methodology that CervicalCheck chose at the time, it had these audit findings.  It stated in February that these audit findings could provide information to women as to why their cancers were not prevented and information on the effectiveness and limitations of screening.  In March they said to me that the gist of the situation is that the programme has information on the woman's screening history that may be of benefit to her and which they believe should be disclosed.  In April, they said this represented six and a half years of screening and that the process which had been evolving then clearly underscored the need to offer women an opportunity to learn about the audit and to choose to know the result.  The July information for healthcare professionals that all members have been furnished with says this.  I know there are queries about the letters and I would love to be able to get to those questions, but the information note to healthcare professionals states:<\/p><blockquote>Where the review outcome suggests that the abnormality was not detected on a cytology or histology test or that, under treatment, a colposcopy might have been a factor, at the appropriate time, please inform the woman that a cervical cancer audit process exists, that her history has been reviewed and that she can be informed of the outcome if she so wishes.<\/blockquote> <p>There are two things here.  There is how CervicalCheck actually went about that process and whether it was the right process.  The view at the time was that the consulting clinician was the person who was best placed to be able to give that information to the woman.  We might have some questions about that and the processes and procedures CervicalCheck put around it.  The abject failure here, which is the tragedy we are all observing and what we are hearing, is that it did not effectively happen in the end.  Not all of the consultants heeded that particular advice - some of them did, but the vast majority did not - and told the woman that a review had been done of her case and gave her the opportunity, if she so wished, to learn about the outcomes of the review.  That did not happen, and that is the awful thing we face right now because the reality is that cervical cancer is a reality in all our lives.  No screening programme in the world can stop all cervical cancer cases from happening, and the awful thing is that if we continue with our screening programme, we will have more stories in time about women whose cancers were not prevented by cervical screening.  That is a tragedy and a travesty.  We can try to improve it with HPV testing, but it is a reality.  The thing going forward is that what the CervicalCheck programme intended to happen needs to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#NN00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1526544000,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Very finally-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#NN00700","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1526544000,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Finally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#NN00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1526544000,"counter":677,"content":"<p>-----following on from Dr. Holohan's appearance at yesterday's health committee meeting, he said in his statement that it was fair and reasonable not to tell women about incorrect smear tests in 2016.

We had two of the bereaved mothers as part of the maternity strategy, which is approved by Government, we have had patient involvement in our cancer strategy, and it has overhauled completely the attitude of our cancer services.  We have a patient experience survey.  It is happening for the second time this month throughout our hospital system, and we are one of the few countries in the world in this regard.  We have patient safety statements now which require each hospital, for maternity services first and now for hospital services generally, to publish information about safety each month in order that people can see this and to create transparency and visibility.  We have built in the Department of Health a national patient safety office.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, brought those proposals to Cabinet in late 2015 to give what we call a patient safety surveillance function.  One of the things we uncovered as part of the work we have done in recent years is that different parts of our system knew difference pieces of information about safety and we did not join up that information to create a common understanding.  The work we are doing seeks to do that.<\/p> <p>  However, I absolutely accept that that is not enough to respond to any of the harms and bereavements that have occurred for some of the patients about whom the Deputy has spoken.  It will all be cold comfort to them.  Culture change is difficult, but our experience is that working with patients in these situations - and working with them directly, as opposed to through the media - is the best means of ensuring their objective, which is to have their terrible experiences fully and directly inform the work we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#NN01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526544000,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Sending the information through the media is half the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#OO00100","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526544000,"counter":684,"content":"<p>We are absolutely prepared to engaged with them.

Essentially, it is part of a communications strategy to divert attention away from the real problem.  All we hear from her and others in that regard is that screening is not 100% accurate.  Everybody in this room accepts that and that is not the issue.  The issue is that women were not informed when CervicalCheck was informed of wrong smear test results.  They were not given information that they should have been given.  Dr. O'Keeffe knows that this is this issue, as I do.  She has raised the two cases in which people did contact CervicalCheck about their smear test results and were not given information directly.  They were told that the information would be given to their consultants.  The consultants were given the responsibility of deciding whether they should tell the patients.  We know that some did and that some did not.  The facts are that no woman received information directly from CervicalCheck and that that was a failing on the part of the programme.<\/p> <p>  I want to put a question to Mr. Connaghan.

Will the Deputy now let me explain why I did not believe it should be escalated?  When we look at the escalation of issues broadly related to patient safety, there are categories that we use.  The top category and the most significant involves a situation where we have information on a service which is still open and into which patients are still going and which is not safe.  That is the most significant issue that might require an intervention and there have been such examples.  The next most significant involves a situation where something comes to light and where we know that patients have been through a service, harm has occurred, they have been exposed in some way to something and a lookback needs to be conducted in order that those patients can be identified and some service offered to them to try to remediate what has happened.  The next level would be where something else has happened, but it is an individual case in which we do not believe there are wider risks to the public.  However, the merits of the case are also something that consider by way of escalation.  In the particular case we had potential for something to become a matter of reporting.

Mr. Connaghan saw what transpired there.  If that has not told him a lot, I do not know what will.  The difference between Mr. Gleeson and Dr. O'Keeffe is that Mr. Gleeson said \"sorry\".  He apologised.  I hate to say this to Dr. O'Keeffe but I do not believe that anyone watching this would have confidence that she did her job properly.  She said that she \"assumed\", she used the word \"think\", and said that there was a reliance on the staff.  I presume Mr. Gleeson is part of that.  We saw the State Claims Agency cases coming through.  For over two and a quarter years, as the Chair has outlined, Dr. O'Keeffe did not once probe it.  For me, that is at the absolute nub of what is going on here.<\/p> <p>  Let me explain something to Dr. O'Keeffe.  We are politicians.  We are not clinicians.  Some of us have medically-orientated qualifications - I refer to my colleague on the left.  If there was an iota of a mention of this issue in anything to do with the Department of Health, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, would be out of a job.  Deputy Leo Varadkar would probably not be Taoiseach.  That is the likelihood of where we would end up.  This is transfixing the nation.  People are absolutely appalled and disgusted.  Pick whatever word one chooses.<\/p> <p>  For over two and a quarter years, or whatever timeframe one desires, there was a catastrophic failure in CervicalCheck at management level, and possibly at other levels, and Dr. O'Keeffe has not even said sorry.  She has not apologised.  It is not good enough to say that she assumed.  It not good enough to say that she relied on legal cases.  It should have been probed.  It should have been dealt with.  It should have been a monthly issue and an issue that was constantly referred to on and on and on again. <\/p> <p>  I have gone through all the documentation, probably more than most.  I could write a book on it.  I have so many documents now that I am in information overload.  There is no way I can see any justification for this.  There is no way in which Vicky, Stephen and the others can get any comfort from anything that Dr. O'Keeffe has said or from any of the processes that were in place.  In respect of Mr. Gleeson, I am wondering how this makes him feel.  Dr. O'Keeffe feels that she has been let down.  I do not know what way that makes Mr. Gleeson feel.  He works for her obviously.  Does he feel that he has let her down?  In fairness, at least he apologised.

The Deputy is correct in that respect.  If I may just comment, some of what is being said here is a more general issue for the profession.  In general terms the profession itself has espoused and continues to espouse its commitment to the values of openness, honesty and open disclosure.  Perhaps not every single member of the profession has fully discharged those obligations appropriately.  I am not making a judgment in respect of this.  It is very important that the profession, on its own and in its own standing, finds means to make clear to the public its commitment to those values because, independent of the roles of the HSE and the Department of Health, very significant societal charges are being made in a broad sense about the values ascribed to open disclosure, trust and honest on the part of individual medical practitioners.

The important point is that these are all women who have or have had cervical cancer.

The issue that then emerged was that there were a number of women in the National Cancer Registry with whom the CervicalCheck programme had not made contact.  That is the group for which we have taken the data from the National Cancer Registry.  We are matching them through with the screening programme and it will come up with a number which will be much lower than 1,600, which is the total.  We had a discussion with the Department without knowing the final number.  We will probably be asking the new review team to prioritise the women in question in order that they will be contacted first to make them aware.  All that is being said is that they have had cervical cancer, were in contact with the screening programme and have smears that need to be audited as a result.  It is not making a conclusion as to whether there was a difficulty.  They will be the next priority once we know who they are.

Depending on the life or the time of the screening programme, when we make international comparisons, it must be taken into consideration, for example, if something has been started fairly recently or if it has been running for 20 years.  There are differences in the detection rates and the downstream recording of high-grade versus low-grade incidences.  Doing international comparisons purely on statistics around laboratories needs to be treated with a little bit of caution.  This is why the faculty we are constructing to provide advice in that regard, the review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, will also be important because we need to compare not just within Ireland but also against international best practice.

The issue was not the audit process but the communication of the results of that audit process to women.

Dr. O'Keeffe said the communication with the stakeholders and patients was being appropriately managed at this time.  At that stage in October, is it fair to say that Dr. Holohan and Dr. O'Keeffe were of the opinion that this was being addressed, women were going to be informed through their clinicians and that was the instruction that was given?

There is one last thing before Deputy O'Connell comes in.  We have had all this talk about open disclosure and I am back to it again.  We are utterly sceptical of the issue of open disclosure.  Mr. Gleeson relies mainly on his belief that there was a policy of open disclosure which he assumed everyone was following and he had no reason to believe otherwise.  I go back to the first letter I read out today - to the last paragraph of that letter from the HSE to us on 8 February.  It is a full eight pages on open disclosure and where we are from the beginning to the end.  The last paragraph is on moving forward.  I will read this out for Mr. Connaghan.  It is the last paragraph of the whole letter of 8 February to the committee from the HSE, Committee of Public Accounts document reference No. 1075.  The paragraph states that work continues in relation to the matters set out in the letter with priorities for 2018 set as the roll-out of the programme to GPs and practice staff - we are talking about open disclosure; the development of guidelines for national screening services and for pharmacies; the development of open disclosure for healthcare acquired infections; a review of the national documents; the development of an open disclosure e-learning programme; and the further development of an open disclosure performance management tool for services.  As such, the HSE told us in February that a priority for moving forward for 2018 was the development of guidelines in respect of open disclosure for national screening services.<\/p> <p>  It is clear the HSE knew earlier this year that open disclosure was not working.  The HSE wrote to this committee to tell us a priority for 2018 was the development of guidelines for national screening services on open disclosure.  When I read that as the official response from the HSE to the committee a couple of months ago, I must seriously discount everything I am hearing about people's belief that open disclosure was operating.  The HSE itself did not believe it.  Months later and as early as this year, it said a priority for 2018 was to develop guidelines.  That implies clearly that not only was open disclosure not happening, but the HSE was only in the process of developing guidelines in relation to the national screening programme.  Witnesses will understand that view given what was provided to us in writing and which was, I think, a fair, accurate and honest assessment.  This was written before any of the recent controversy arose and in the calm light of day to be helpful to the Committee of Public Accounts and to reflect accurately the HSE's position to the committee at our request.  When we hear that it was presumed that everyone was following open disclosure, we have to note that the HSE did not believe people were doing that because it said it was only going to implement a policy on that for this year.  I am not really asking Mr. Connaghan to comment.  It is self-evident.  There is a lot on Mr. Connaghan's plate as interim Director General.  Will he take it on board?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051700002#AAA00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526544000,"counter":1196,"content":"<p>I can only comment using an assumption when I guess that what we have is the original standard national policy document that lays out broad principles of what we should be doing around open disclosure.  Naturally, as one goes through the implementation of all of this, one gets questions which arise from all aspects of the service.  It could be the ambulance service, disinfection services or anything else.  As one goes through the implementation of a programme like that, one will typically write individual, tailored documents for parts of the programme.  This is a natural development of the roll-out of that policy.  We will need to reconsider where we go on that now.  We are heading towards legislation on it.

We have not got that but I have requested it.  It is key here.  There are many key things here but this is one of them.  At the outset of an audit, one should know what its purpose is and what one will do with the data when one has it.  I do not like to repeat myself, but we spoke yesterday about the NICE guidelines which many healthcare professionals work towards.  One of the core elements of clinical audit involves six ways to serve patients better.  I argue that we need to look at the methodology paper to see if there was ever a plan that this would seek to serve patients better.  Without seeing it, it seems obvious that it never mentioned the patient, but I might be wrong.<\/p> <p>  Is it fair to say that if Dr. O'Keeffe had not made decisions based on her feelings or made assumptions based on information received, we would not be where we are today?

Around all of the elements of open disclosure, for example, they spoke to colleagues internationally who are doing this and they looked at our own policies and people who advise in relation to that.  Throughout all of that process, one could certainly look back and say we were all looking at it through rose-tinted glasses, but if one looks at the October briefing, it gave evidence of open disclosure happening.  There was certainly an expectation and I feel quite strongly that the documentation there demonstrates that there was a clear intent.  If there had been any suggestion to me at any point of that process throughout 2016 that there might be an issue, the documentation makes it very clear that I would absolutely have done something about it.  If that had been raised with me at any point in 2017, I would have dealt with it as I did when it was escalated to me in February 2016.
