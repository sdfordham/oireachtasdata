I know of two cases.  One is a very sad case as a person who owned land died and the land passed back to the mother; she is now in a nursing home.  She transferred the land approximately one year before she went into the nursing home but the process takes into account any land transferred within five years.  The person who inherited the land has paid the full whack of inheritance tax but was not entitled to agricultural relief.  That person is also now paying the full whack for nursing home charges.<\/p> <p>In the second case, the father died and the mother got 50% of the farm while the sons got the other 50%.  She developed an illness where she had to be admitted to a nursing home.  They are paying &euro;2,500 per month in nursing home charges.  There is no way the land is even earning that kind of money but they are required to pay that &euro;2,500 per month.  It is in this context I raise the matter.<\/p> <p>I have an email from the Department of Health on this issue dated 28 June 2016, believe it or not.  I understood there would be some reform in the matter.  I know there was a proposal from the Irish Farmers Association to apply the same rules that concern agricultural relief - in other words, there would be a devaluing of land by 90% and taking into account full value of the dwelling house.  I am not sure what progress has been made and it is in that context I have raised this morning's matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#A00700","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his continued interest, assistance and guidance.  I look forward to working closely with him on the matter, one of many in the health area in which he has a particular expertise and interest.  As I come to terms with getting on top of my brief, I look forward to working with the Senator more closely.<\/p> <p>The nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, provides financial support towards the cost of long-term residential care services in nursing homes and ensures that long-term nursing home care is accessible to everyone assessed as needing it.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means, while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p> <p>Under the scheme, an applicant will contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of any assets per annum.  The State will then pay the balance of the cost of care.  It is Government policy, as the Senator is aware, to encourage orderly succession arrangements for farms, and this is also endorsed by farming organisations.  The Revenue Commissioners have a number of schemes in place designed to protect the value of a transferred family farm, such as tax relief schemes relating to capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and stamp duty.  In most cases, early succession arrangements in families should ensure that farm assets are transferred well in advance of five years before nursing home care is required, meaning that a levy on the farm asset is avoided entirely.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that an applicant&rsquo;s principal private residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three-year cap.  The scheme ensures that nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care and contains a number of important safeguards.  For example, where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from the estate.  This is the optional loan element of the scheme.  It is important to note that the scheme already contains provisions for the treatment of income generating assets such as farms.  In an acknowledgment that unexpected health events can occur that prevent early succession arrangements, a farm or relevant business can also qualify for the three-year cap.  This applies where the person has suffered a sudden illness or disability that causes them to need long-term nursing home care; the person or partner was actively engaged in the daily management of the farm until the time of the sudden illness or disability; and a family successor certifies that he or she will continue the management of the farm.<\/p> <p>When the scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that the scheme would be reviewed.  The report of the review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of that review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the scheme.  In a further acknowledgement of the importance of this issue, we have committed in the Programme for a Partnership Government to reviewing the scheme to remove any discrimination against small business and family farms.  An interdepartmental and agency working group has been established to progress many of the recommendations contained in the review of the scheme, including the examination of the treatment of family farm and business assets.  This examination is ongoing and at an advanced stage.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jim Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important to remember the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation and any changes to the scheme will require legislative implementation.

The case I was referring to is a case of Parkinson's disease, which, as he will be aware, is a gradual illness.  In that case, the person is now being penalised.  The person who is in the nursing home obviously cannot predetermine what illness he or she gets.  The person is now being penalised because of having a particular type of illness because it was regarded in the assessment as a gradual illness rather than a sudden illness.<\/p> <p>My second issue with the current position is that even if one does not give the agricultural relief that is available under the inheritance tax, it is for an indefinite duration that the payments are being made to the nursing homes.  There is no three-year cut-off point whereas there is for everyone else.  It is 7.5% of the assets, but for a maximum of three years.  With farmers and businesses, there is no three-year rule.  It is a severe penalty.  It is in that context that the issue needs review.<\/p> <p>In the other case to which I referred, where the person died with no will made, the property came back to the mother who was then admitted to a nursing home.

Farming families - I come from a rural constituency and am familiar with that particular challenge - and indeed families with small businesses who have worked hard and have paid their contributions along the way to the State suffer a discriminatory practice where the three-year cap is not applied to their assets but it is applied in the case of those with a principal private residences.

A number of young farmers spoke to me recently about the farm relief scheme.  While it is positive and farmers are members of it, at present young farmers are finding it hard to get relief workers.  People are not applying for the vacancies as they arise.  A young farmer, who was going to a wedding one weekend, had to bring back somebody who was much older than he was to milk the cows and carry out different work on the farm.  While I realise there are qualified persons who are registered with the farm relief scheme, there is a shortage of applicants for the vacancies.<\/p> <p>It is a big issue for farmers, especially for the future.  They have to reach their 2020 targets but they are concerned that with the shortage of people, between people not applying and people not responding, there will be a problem in reaching their targets.  What is the Minister of State's opinions on it?  Can incentives be put in place to encourage people to get involved in farming?  After all, one's first reaction is to go back to one's roots.  Many people came from farming backgrounds before they went into other walks of life.

As somebody who is a graduate of the farm apprenticeship scheme, which, at the time, was the hard work scheme, I certainly appreciate the value of having young people trained in the area.<\/p> <p>Human capital is one of the five themes highlighted in Food Wise 2025.  It highlights the need for the attraction, retention and development of skills and talent right along the supply chain.  Investment in people is crucial for the success of Food Wise 2025 and the success of the sector as a whole.  I might add that I had to leave the national economic dialogue to come here to take this Commencement matter and that an afternoon break-out session will be on the agrifood sector addressing all the challenges and that one of the five themes will be human capital.<\/p> <p>The report identifies a number of skills gaps, including lack of advanced financial and business development capabilities, foreign language skills, and capacity to absorb new technologies and processes both at producer and processing levels.  The implementation of the report recommendations on skills and human capital will be crucial if the ambition for the sector in the report is to be achieved.<\/p> <p>Highly skilled and committed people have driven this sector for decades and the agrifood sector is embedded in our culture as a nation.  In a fast changing globalised economy, the premium and advantages to be achieved by applying the most up-to-date skills and techniques, attracting new enthusiastic and trained people and the ongoing development of the skills of those already involved in the sector will allow the sector fulfil Its potential.<\/p> <p>Continuing changes to regulatory and farm compliance requirements have implications for both young farmer education and the lifelong learning requirements of adult farmers.  Likewise rapid advances in the use of information technology, applied software and the use of smart applications is impacting on the farming sector and the education and up-skilling of young and adult farmers.<\/p> <p>In November last year, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine hosted a food and drinks skills workshop.  This proved a useful format for informing stakeholders from the food and beverage sector, trade unions and academics of the skills gaps facing the sector, from factory workers to top executives, and gathering practical ideas of how to address these issues.  A list of recommendations were agreed at the workshop and these were presented to the expert group on skills in December.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, launched the 2017 Report of Future Skills Needs in the Food and Drinks Sector in April.<\/p> <p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine hosted a similar workshop on 6 April, looking at future skills needs and gaps at farm level.  The workshop was held to highlight the skills gaps at farm level, the need to develop a career path for those working on the farm to use this to attract and retain talent for this sector and improve the overall perception of a career in farming.  The workshop was divided into three themes, farm operatives, farmers and farm managers, and the next generation, with speakers from Teagasc, the farm relief services, progressive farmers, both male and female, and the land mobility service.  Representatives from the various farming organisations, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Education and Skills attended the workshop also.  This resulted in a number of recommendations being made.  These recommendations were presented to the Minister, Deputy Creed, at the Food Wise 2025 high-level implementation committee in May and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is currently examining the next steps for these recommendations.<\/p> <p>The recommendations are based on the three themes of the workshop.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Andrew Doyle:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are all aware of the significant shortage of skilled labour on dairy farms, in particular, but also in horticulture.  A solution could be a training model to provide for skills training for farm operatives as well as future farmers.  Common issues identified at the workshop include better communication on career possibilities to young farmers, in particular at secondary school level; skills training needs to adapt to meet new skills gaps and new and different workforce; literacy and language support should be mainstreamed in all training; and the need for continuous professional development as part of career development.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that Irish farms are the bedrock on which this whole multi-billion euro sector rests.  This is something we must never forget and the Minister, Deputy Creed, and I are determined to ensure, together with agencies such as Teagasc, that farming is a viable career opportunity for those who wish to pursue it.  Earlier this month, Teagasc published a farm labour manual to assist farmers who are currently employing or thinking of employing a labour unit for the first time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#B00600","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

A long time ago when I was in secondary school, an official from the old farm apprenticeship board came to the school to give us a talk.  We then went to agricultural college.  County committees of agriculture, which do not exist anymore, awarded scholarships and students were informed about the different career paths and opportunities.  Farming is competing on many levels to attract people to embark on a career in the sector.  Between 60% and 70% of leaving certificate students go on to third level but a stream of other options is available to them, including apprenticeships.  At the end of the day, farming has to be seen as a lifestyle and to be family friendly.  That is why the Senator's comments about the relief service are important.  I worked for a relief service many years ago in New Zealand.  I was sent in to do holiday cover for a weekend, ten days, two or three weeks or to cover someone who was injured.  Such could provide a second income for young people who are trying to come home until their father or mother decides to pass on the farm.  It could be a transitionary arrangement for some people.

Having served with her on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council many years ago, I am well aware of her passion for education.  I wish her well.  We enjoyed a reception in UCD last night where she more than held her own.  Anyone who thinks they will have it easy with her will be surprised.  Indeed, I will bear that in mind as I make my contribution.<\/p><p>When I was thinking about what I would say, I decided to download the speech I made seven weeks ago on this issue when the Minister for Education and Skills was present.  I regret that little has changed since then and that is why I was moved to table this Commencement matter again as we reach the final week of the year in Ballinteer Educate Together national school.  Classes are breaking up today, if they did not do so yesterday.  The case history, with which the Minister of State will be familiar, is long.  I attended the first meeting in 2010 when it was decided that an Educate Together school was needed in the greater Ballinteer-Stepaside area.  We now have two schools, which are bursting at the seams and which have long waiting lists.  One school set up in Stepaside has thankfully moved into excellent accommodation being built by the Department beside Belarmine estate.  However, Ballinteer Educate Together national school is in limbo.  Unfortunately, I regret that its situation is not being helped by the intransigence of the Department and its silence on many issues relating to parents, teachers and the wider school community.  The numbers involved in this school are increasing exponentially.  It is, however, a positive school.<\/p><p>A letter writing campaign was initiated in September.  There was another in May and again a few weeks ago.  The first two campaigns resulted in more than 500 letters to the Department.  The responses received were minor.  I appreciate the Minister's hands are tied on this in certain respects but one or two acknowledgements do not provide answers or relief.  They just increase the frustration.  I will give credit to the new Taoiseach.  When he was contacted earlier this month, his rapid response was welcome, even though he left the detail to the Department.  <\/p><p>Ultimately, the school is coping with two key issues.  There is no end to the planning delays on the site agreed for the permanent school, which is beside St. Tiernan's, a school I know well as a former member of the board of management.  Access issues need to be resolved and parents need to be reassured that the Department is 100% committed to new permanent accommodation for Ballinteer Educate Together national school on the St. Tiernan's site with good agreed access points and all the facilities a modern, progressive, growing school in a populous area requires, which marry well with the needs of the excellent secondary school.<\/p><p>The interim solution is to move the school, which will provide 11 classes in September, <i>en masse<\/i>to the Notre Dame campus where it will collocate with the new Gaelscoil that is moving from Clonskeagh and the remnants of Notre Dame secondary school as it eases out of existence.  That is an unfortunate event but there is nothing we could do as public representatives.  There is huge concern among school management and the principal that they do not know what they are moving into in September.  They had one or two welcome meetings on-site with departmental officials.  I have eight pages of questions that were put to them, which have yet to be answered.  When the intention is to move an entire school to a new facility in such a short time, that adds to the stress and concern and it puts work on people whose job it is not to do this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#C00400","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position on the temporary and permanent accommodation for Ballinteer Educate Together national school.

The school currently has nine mainstream classes, which will increase to 11 mainstream classes in September 2017.  As the Senator will be aware, my Department recently completed the purchase of the Notre Dame campus located on Churchtown Road, Dublin 14.  The campus will be used to facilitate temporary accommodation for the Ballinteer school from September 2017, pending completion of the permanent accommodation for the school at the St. Tiernan's site.

The Department is examining some issues which have been raised following this meeting and will be in touch with the schools again this week in this regard.<\/p><p>I know that there is a long history with this.  In December 2012, as Senator Richmond is aware, outline planning permission to provide a permanent school building for Ballinteer Educate Together national school was submitted to the relevant local authority but was refused on the grounds of site access.  This was appealed by my Department to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but subsequently withdrawn to facilitate submission to the local authority of an amended outline planning permission in 2013, which was also refused on similar grounds.  This decision was appealed by the Department of Education and Skills to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but was refused.  However, the board considered that the matter of assessing alternative means of accessing these lands would benefit from a co-ordinated approach by my Department and the planning authority in the interests of achieving a comprehensive and balanced solution to ongoing access issues on this educational campus.<\/p><p>As the Senator will appreciate, this is a complex planning issue and my Department has approached and met with all of the relevant parties including the council, the schools and third-party landowners with a view to finding an acceptable solution to the access issue.  All aspects are being progressed in close liaison with the local authority and it is imperative that all of this work is done to the satisfaction of the council in order to ensure that a third planning application is successful.

I would ask two things of the Department and would appreciate if the Minister of State could feed them back.  First, that the many letters that were sent nearly a month ago would receive replies.  I have seen the three questions asked and could answer them myself.  It probably would not be the answers that the people writing would want.  To let them go unanswered with one or two acknowledgements of receipt sent out every so often is not good enough in this era, when we expect a level of responsibility from the organs of government.<\/p> <p>Second, I encourage the Minister of State to put pressure on the officials in her Department to work very closely with the principal in question.  A lot of responsibility and extra pressure has been put on one individual, supported by excellent volunteers, during her holiday break to put in place an entire school in a new location in a very short period.  The principal needs a lot more than occasional meetings and one or two kind words.  She needs a lot of help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#D00200","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I will give Senator Richmond a commitment that the letters will be replied to by Department officials.

I congratulate the Minister on his new position.  We are happy in Mayo and in rural Ireland to have somebody at the Cabinet table.  There are huge expectations of the Minister and a lot of issues to be dealt with.  I wish him well in his work.  It is important for us all to work together.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to address the very serious issue arising from the implementation of the 2014-20 Leader programme.  He will know that all is not well in Leader-land.  From 1992 to 2016, the programme was very successfully delivered by local development companies.  He will also be aware that I worked for one of them myself, South-West Mayo Development Company, for many years.<\/p> <p>The current Leader programme was launched on 31 July 2016, and was allocated &euro;220 million to address poverty reduction, social inclusion and the economy of rural areas.  A decision was made by the Minister's Government that the Leader programme would be delivered under the local authorities.  This was in spite of thousands of people gathering in community halls and hotels all over the country to tell it that its decision was wrong and that it was trying to fix something that was not broken.<\/p> <p>A number of issues are now arising as a result of this decision.  First, the level of grant approvals at national level is extremely low although we are now 11 months into the programme.  By way of comparison, I cite a mid-west local action group that, in previous iterations of the programme, at this stage in the process had spent &euro;1.4 million of the grant aid.  Under the current programme the same group has only spent &euro;6,600.  Another group had allocated &euro;1.7 million by this point in the previous programme, yet in the current cycle, no grants have been finalised at this stage because of all the bureaucracy involved.<\/p> <p>The estimated minimum timeline for the promoters seeking grant support from the expression of interest to the grant contract stage is now around nine months.  This is totally unacceptable.  The programme administration workload has trebled, reducing time for front-line staff to support communities and entrepreneurs to engage with the programme.  The Minister's Department is contracting Pobal to audit 100% of the programme expenditure.  This is unprecedented.  The previous administration checks were carried out very effectively by local development companies.  That is evidenced by the low level of ineligible funding in the 2007-13 programme, when it was at only 0.5% and incurred no additional cost.  In reality, the local development companies continue to undertake the checks, passing them on to local authorities who, in turn, pass them on to Pobal for triplicate checks.  The cost of this function may end up becoming very significant.<\/p> <p>There are a couple of actions that the Minister can take.  He can reduce the administration levels by identifying a lead Department to streamline the Leader funding to local development companies.  He must utilise the available option of the simplified cost as well.  It will enable Leader to focus on communities and achievements in the local development strategy.  He must remove the expression of interest above all.  I know there have been attempts to do so but it has not been done.  It adds three months to the application time for promoters and is not working.  The Minister must also remove the additional public procurement requirements, to streamline anything under &euro;100.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Travel and subsistence must be included because, again, there is huge bureaucracy surrounding that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#D00800","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>The Senator has used her four minutes, so Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh is excluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#E00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I have five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#E00300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>No.  The Senator has four.

I look forward to working with them.  This will not be a simple job but, at the same time, I have a role and a part to play.  I have a seat at Cabinet, and whatever I can do for rural Ireland I will be there to do it.  The first problem I inherited when I took over this job was this issue.  I will read out the official response but then I wish to make a few further comments.<\/p> <p>The Leader programme is a key part of the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development and has the capacity to deliver significant outcomes for rural areas.  Leader funding is managed and delivered by local action groups in each of the 28 Leader subregional areas around the country.  The Leader programme funds projects under policy themes related to economic development, enterprise development, social inclusion and the rural environment.  In total, &euro;250 million will be invested in Leader over the period up to 2020, and one of my priorities in my new position will be to ensure that this funding is delivered to the rural communities and businesses that need it.  The programme is co-financed by the European Union to the value of &euro;157 million and is subject to EU regulatory provisions governing rural development funding.  It is important, therefore, that appropriate checks and balances are in place to ensure that the funding is delivered correctly.<\/p> <p>In light of a number of serious issues that arose in the delivery of the previous Leader programme, my Department has made some administrative changes to the programme to safeguard the public funding invested through Leader.  These changes will ensure Ireland's continued sanction by the European Union to deliver the Leader programme.  At the same time, the Government wants to see the Leader programme implemented as efficiently and effectively as possible, and I am aware of concerns regarding some of the administrative procedures related to the programme and the processing of applications.  In this regard, on 17 May last, my predecessor hosted a forum with participants from all of the local action groups and local development companies delivering the Leader programme to explore the issues of concern to them and identify potential solutions aimed at streamlining the current administrative and application procedures.  The forum, which was attended by more than 70 people, was very productive and participants identified a number of areas where they felt procedures could be streamlined and where the burden on project applicants could be reduced.  As a result of the contributions made at the forum, a list of programme modifications has been developed to improve the delivery of the Leader programme and these have been communicated to all the local action groups and local development companies.  In total, I am committed to implementing 31 actions - 31 changes - to improve the administrative procedures relating to the Leader programme.  These actions represent a very comprehensive response to the issues raised and the solutions identified by the participants at the forum.<\/p> <p>The two Senators are correct in that I want to see this Leader funding administered, I want to see the money spent and I want to see it streamlined.  I have given a commitment now that I will monitor this from week to week.  The Senators are quite correct that the funding is in place.  We want to get it out to the areas that need it and to the people who have made the applications.  We have made 31 changes and I am told that these companies are all happier now.  I hope we will now see a big improvement in the roll-out of the number of applications that have been received, but I want to see the roll-out of money, I want to see the money spent and I want to see some of it spent before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#E00700","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>That is a very strong commitment.

Even if we take Cork alone, the original programme was &euro;49 million, it is down now to &euro;13 million and in Mayo we lost out on &euro;9 million.

So far this year five cyclists have died on our roads, including the much loved principal of St. Louis Senior Primary School, Mr. P&aacute;draic Carney.  Last week he died on his way to work at the age of 53.  Earlier this month the international consultancy firm, Copenhagenize, removed Dublin from its index on the world's 20 most friendly cities.  Cycling is increasingly popular in this city.  The explosion of community bike schemes, such as Dublin Bikes and BleeperBikes, have added to that.  Cycling is healthy, inexpensive and environmentally friendly.  We, in Fianna F&aacute;il, believe that this type of sustainable transport needs to be supported properly, which ultimately means more investment.  The UN recommends that 20% of a national transport budget should be allocated to cycling and walking yet this Government spends just 2% of its overall transport spending on them.  We need to ensure that the capital's roads are safe for anyone who wishes to cycle and make cycling deaths a thing of the past.<\/p> <p>I wish to refer to the social media app called Snapchat.  The app allows people to send messages or pictures to each other that disappear after a certain period.  Snapchat has added a new modification called Snap Map.  I ask parents to be vigilant with their teenagers and children who use Snapchat and, more particularly, Snap Map.  Essentially, Snap Map allows users to locate a person on a map in real time.  Snap Map will broadcast one's exact location to anyone on one's list of friends each time one opens the app.  In reality, we know that many users of Snapchat, especially children, will have people on their list of friends who they do not know or have never met in reality.  I am concerned that this new technology may put children in a very vulnerable situation where they inadvertently broadcast their location.  The function clearly has the potential to put children at risk.  I encourage parents to urge their children to use the opt-out option for Snap Map so that their children's welfare is safeguarded and protected. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#G00500","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I would like to raise three issues today.

Second, I wish to refer to the Irish seafood sector, particularly because Seafest 2017 will be launched tonight.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will host a special conference in the Radisson Hotel in Galway tomorrow morning.  I shall attend the conference and I have no doubt that other Senators will also attend.  Third, I want to briefly talk about the Intoxicating Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2017.<\/p> <p>I shall kick off by discussing the Irish seafood export market.  I ask the Leader to organise statements on the Irish seafood exports strategy.  The Irish seafood industry is worth over a phenomenal &euro;1 billion annually; I got the figure from the Department yesterday.  Also, approximately 2,000 registered commercial sea fishing vessels traverse Irish waters and there are 161 seafood processing countries within Ireland.  All of that proves it is a huge sector.  The top five countries that Ireland exports fish to are Nigeria, France, the UK, Spain and Italy.  There is a need for us to home in on the seafood export strategy so I ask the Leader to arrange a debate or statements on the subject.  <\/p> <p>As we all know, the deadline for crucial talks on Stormont is tomorrow.  There are issues with the Irish Sign Language, equality issues in terms of same-sex marriages and other stumbling blocks.  There is also the issue of having a bill of rights for the people of Northern Ireland.  I hope that all of the issues can be overcome.  They are important issues for us in the South and, equally, they should important for us in the North of Ireland.  I wish all parties every success with the talks.

Sinn F&eacute;in tabled a motion that would prevent a situation whereby households would be forced to switch over to a new charging system that would result in dramatic price increases.  We also asked for the retention of bags and labels for anyone who disposed of very little waste.  We did so because we viewed a one-size-fits all per kilo weight charge as impacting on lower income families more severely. <\/p> <p>The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has mentioned in his departmental press release that there had been an increase in waste sent to landfill in the past two years.

It is clear that domestic households cannot be entirely responsible for such a large increase in the volume of landfill waste.  Sinn F&eacute;in's motion contains protections for those on low incomes.  It has all happened in the context of the announcement that bands for charging, rather than a flat rate, will be introduced.  There are many families with large numbers of children, including children in respect of whom additional waste is produced, who are worried about what this will mean for them.  They have been left to rely on competition within the private sector to ensure they will not see an increase in their waste disposal charges.  I urge the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, to re-examine this issue and provide the necessary assurances.

It is an important report which deals with the position and treatment of lone parents in Ireland.  Will the Leader provide time for a debate on it and its concrete recommendations?  Members will be aware of the information emerging on the Bessborough home.  As acknowledged in the report, the State has a poor historical record in the treatment of lone parents and their children.  It is important that this be recognised and that we ensure current policy is serving the best possible outcomes for lone parents and their children.  As we know, we are currently not delivering, given the extraordinary high levels of child poverty among lone parent families.  The report makes concrete recommendations which reference the provision of support, rather than conditionality, in terms of engagement in employment; an extension of eligibility for the jobseeker's transitional payment until a child reaches 18 years of age; access to education; case worker support; monitoring and setting real targets for education completion; a reduction in poverty among lone parent families and, importantly, proposals in respect of the payment of maintenance.  The unfortunate reality in Ireland is that many lone parents live in fear that their payments will be reduced because of the non-receipt of maintenance payments.  We need to move away from this towards an efficient and appropriate State system.  As I said, there are concrete proposals made in this excellent report which has received cross-party support.  I reiterate my request to the Leader to provide time for a debate on the report and the constructive proposals made therein on supporting lone parents and their children and how we might move forward in that regard.<\/p> <p>On the sustainable development goals, a ministerial meeting on the issue is scheduled to take place towards the end of July.

On the anniversary of publication of its school admissions Bill to deal with the baptism barrier, the Labour Party is dependent on the Government to allow Government time to allow the Bill to proceed.  It is not offering a perfect solution in dealing with the baptism barrier, but it would prioritise geography over religion in school admissions.  The Government's Bill is a classic case of bending the knee to powerful interests, including the Catholic Church and the fee-paying school body, in that it completely side-steps the baptism barrier issue and allows the continuation of the right of children of past pupils of fee-paying schools to attend the school attended by their parents.  In its Bill the Labour Party proposes that 10% of the school body be made up of such students, but Fine Gael believes the figure should be set at 25%.  Any rational thinking person would not allow such a provision to be included at all.  It is unbelievable a school would demand that a particular number of children of past pupils be accommodated.  How is a student whose parents did not attend second level education to gain admission to a school?  Such students should not have to compete for a place with a student who has an absolute entitlement through a royal blood line to attend a school.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to discuss the status of the Government's watered down School Admissions Bill and the Labour Party's Bill which was published this day last year and would deal in some way with the baptism barrier?  While it would not do so to the satisfaction of many, it seeks to improve the position by prioritising geography over religion.  This is an issue that affects a huge number of children in the State.  When it comes to vested interests, Fine Gael always bends the knee.  There is no reason the Labour Party's Bill cannot proceed to the next Stage.  I implore the Leader, therefore, to encourage the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to enable us to discuss the matter further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#H00300","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I welcome the announcement made by the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, on free access to cultural and heritage sites for all children under 12 years.

The decision taken by the Health and Safety Authority to cut the budget by 25%, from &euro;384,000 last year to &euro;287,000 this year, is alarming and very hard to fathom when one considers that, so far this year, unfortunately, there have been 13 fatalities in the agriculture sector.  Of the 45 fatalities last year, 16 were in the agriculture sector.  Those of us who grew up on a farm know that it is a great place in which to grow up but a dangerous place in which to work.  As I said, the decision by the Health and Safety Authority is regrettable.

If I do not get this guarantee I will call a vote in the House on it today.  It is a very serious Bill, which has caused extraordinary disarray between the Judiciary and politicians.  It is absolutely outrageous.  It might have been done on the precipice of a wing, in the sense that Fine Gael had nowhere else to go with it and had to commit to it.  It is not coming from a centrality of purpose, at least I do not feel it is, but that is for my argument.  I would like a guarantee from the Leader that it will not be guillotined.  I do not care if it does not come here until September or October or whenever, but whenever it does it should not be guillotined.<\/p><p>Equally as serious, and anybody living on the other side of Longford should listen to this, the former chairman of the Western Development Commission, Mr. Paddy McGuinness, told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs he was resigning because of frustration with Departments, the Government and the commission.  He was not given his enhanced rule.  There were turf wars.  There has been no board in place since February 2014.  He said what is happening is absolutely appalling.  He said in spite of the good work done by the Western Development Commission the region is actually failing and falling further behind and things are not been delivered.<\/p><p>He said the final straw was the handling of an allocation of &euro;2 million in 2015 to develop a pilot strategic regional development office.  We all speak about the development of the west of Ireland.  Here is a man who was the director of the commission and who has resigned.  The moneys were appropriated as capital expenditure.  The proposal did not need nor could use capital expenditure, but over 18 months of representation he failed to have the funds transferred to current expenditure.  As a result, no progress has been made on an exciting initiative, and to date not a cent of the &euro;2 million has been spent.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, is without portfolio but is supposed to have a portfolio for rural Ireland.  I ask that he come to the House and tell us exactly what is going on with the Western Development Commission.  What will happen Mr. Paddy McGuinness?  Who will listen to him?

That is what I have seen over the years.  There is profound shock in north Roscommon and the Boyle area as 7,800 members of the population will be brought into the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  The area has 18 electoral divisions that will go from Roscommon to Sligo-Leitrim, including urban and rural Boyle, Ballyfarnan, Keadue, Cootehall, Crossna, Rushfield and Rockingham.  This will break up and divide our county.  It is against the principle of the commission.  It breaks all the rules. The commission has brought the constituency of Mayo back to one county.

I am aware that under the chairmanship of the Cathaoirleach and with Senator Conway as rapporteur, there was a report completed by a previous Seanad.  I do not know where that report is sitting and it is high time for us to address the matter again.  We had a cross-party Seanad committee on Brexit and we have cross-party arrangements or meetings on various matters.  If there were 14 fatalities in six months - unfortunately, it is an annual pattern - in any other area, we would all be up in arms.  For example, how would we act if the deaths were a result of terrorism?  There would be committee meetings, legislation and action taken.<\/p> <p>Farm Safety Week will be upon us shortly, the Minister will come in and we will all get the opportunity to make statements.  We will pay lip service and when Farm Safety Week ends, we will all appear to move on.  At the same time, there will be 14 fatalities in a six-month period.  We need to address this very important issue and I would like the House to lead on it.  It may follow up the previous report.  Reports are fine but they seem to end up on shelves.  We need an action plan to see what can be done.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher mentioned the farm safety budget and it is disgraceful that it has been cut.  I do not condone the cut but it is not always about money.  The existing budget was not working so perhaps money is being spent in the wrong areas.  Perhaps it is not being spent efficiently and there may be cheaper ways of tackling the problem through awareness campaigns and education.  It is a very important matter.  As I stated, if 14 Irish people were killed by means other than farm accidents, we would hear much more about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#K00900","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I want to raise the issue of Grenfell Tower again.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said this morning that there is no situation in Ireland that is directly comparable to Grenfell.  What does \"directly comparable\" mean?  This morning the chief fire officer of Dublin Fire Brigade said that the local authorities are best placed to carry out building control inspections but that there are no resources within the local authorities to do so.  The reports of inspections by all local authorities of multi-storey units are due by 19 July, with recommendations.  The national directorate for fire and emergency management is charged with the co-ordination of this process.  The directorate was also responsible for the audit of fire safety compliance in Traveller accommodation in the wake of the 2015 Carrickmines fire in which ten people and one unborn child died.<\/p> <p>Never again should this country allow light-touch building regulations or safety self-certification as we did in the time of the boom, much to our disgrace.  We prioritised profits over the safety of families in their homes.

I am concerned about a recent statement issued by the State Examinations Commission to the effect that there is a serious shortage of examination markers or examiners, particularly in mathematics, Irish and language subjects in general.<\/p> <p>In a different life, I was a leaving certificate examiner and most of the people I worked with would have been experienced teachers of the subjects they were examining, as well as being experienced in actual examining, for which they were well trained.  I note that the advertisement for examiners now states that retired and newly-qualified teachers are eagerly sought by the commission.  While I have the absolute height of respect for retired teachers and young teachers who are just out of college, it is worrying that leaving certificate students would not be exposed, in the marking of their papers, to high-quality, experienced examiners.<\/p> <p>The shortage is directly attributable to the very low rates of remuneration for examiners and the huge workload involved.  It is a very serious task.  It involves a number of days at a training conference and around three weeks' work during the summer months.  It is very tough work and it is very poorly paid.<\/p> <p>Our students deserve the best and should be given every chance to succeed and to receive proper marking.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of Education and Skills to make a statement on how this situation has arisen and why it was not forecast.  It seems to have come out of the blue.  The leaving certificate was just finished when this shortage was flagged.

Over a year ago we spoke about this system but we urged the Department to conduct an awareness and information campaign.  We said that it would be important to produce leaflets and to let people know how important it is to reduce the amount of waste produced.  We all understand that landfill sites are filling up.  We also spoke about the possibility of the introduction of a waiver scheme for elderly people, for large families, for families with young babies in nappies and so forth but none of this was mentioned by the Minister.<\/p> <p>This is going to cause trouble.  A lot of people out there are very angry.  I know this from dealing with people in my own constituency.  I note that a notice of motion was unanimously passed by South Dublin County Council against the pay-by-weight system and this is only the start.  The lack of information is appalling.  This was not even mentioned in the past year and now, all of a sudden, we are being told that on 1 July, the new system will become operational.

Senator Ardagh began with the issue of cycling on our streets and, in particular, in our capital city.  I join her in extending our condolences to the families of the people who have been killed and injured on our roads.  I know that the Government has prepared a Bill dealing with minimum passing distances which will come before the House soon.  The Government is committed to investing in cycling as a sustainable alternative to motorised transport.  The Senator is correct that there is a need to spend more on cycling infrastructure to ensure that we have proper networks, similar to those in many other European capitals.  I would be happy to invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter further.<\/p> <p>I share the concerns of Senators Ardagh and Noone about social media and Snapchat in particular.  It is an issue about which we must have a conversation.  Social media can have very harmful effects in terms of putting pressure on young people.  I am happy to have a debate on the issue in this House.<\/p> <p>I must apologise to Senator Boyhan, who I inadvertently omitted yesterday in the context of a response on the Intoxicating Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2017, sponsored by Senator Lawless.  The situation regarding this important legislation is that the Department is working on the Bill.  My office has been in contact with the Department to ensure that the Bill comes back to this House before the summer recess.  I cannot give the Senator a definitive date as to when it will come back but it is being worked on as we speak.  I am anxious to honour the commitment I gave to Senator Lawless regarding the Bill.  It is important that we bring this Bill to a conclusion and that we have it either passed or rejected by the House.<\/p> <p>In fairness to Senator Lawless and to former Senator Imelda Henry, who did a lot of work on the Bill too, this is very important legislation.  It deals not just with the sale of alcohol on Good Friday but is also linked to the wider sale of alcohol Bill.  It is important that we would have that debate concluded before the summer recess.  I assure Senator Boyhan that we are working on it.  We are not trying to thwart the passage of the Bill but are putting pressure on the Department to bring it to a conclusion.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan also made reference to the issue of the Irish seafood sector and the very important festival that is taking place.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is very committed to that sector.  I would be happy to arrange a debate on seafood exports, the seafood sector and the wider maritime area with the Minister as soon as possible.  <\/p> <p>Senators Boyhan, Conway-Walsh, &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Mac Lochlainn and Norris all raised the issue of the talks in the North today and the importance of Acht na Gaeilge.  Those of us who are republicans in this House recognise the importance of an Irish language Act.  While I cannot speak for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, it is important that we would have an Irish language Act in the North of our country.  It should be possible for citizens of Northern Ireland to be educated through Irish, to be able to speak Irish and to be supported in their use of the Irish language, while also respecting other traditions and cultures.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important that we do promote the Irish language.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, is in Belfast today.  I spoke to him last night.  The deadline is looming.  I appeal to all sides and, in particular, to the DUP as the largest Unionist party to engage in a meaningful way and to reach out so that we can have devolved Government and a decision-making process in the North.  The Minister is committed to resolution of this matter.  Members will be aware that the Taoiseach spoke to Prime Minister May yesterday.  It is in all of our interests to have power-sharing.  The Irish Government will not be found wanting and I know from my engagement with the Minster, Deputy Coveney, that he is committed and wants to see the matter resolved satisfactorily and in a manner that will  be of benefit to the people of the North.  It is important this matter is resolved regardless of how long that takes.  All sides must come together to ensure that we have power-sharing rather than direct rule.<\/p><p>Senators Conway-Walsh, Murnane O'Connor, Gallagher and &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of waste charges.  I took the liberty of pre-empting that this issue would be raised on the Order of Business.  I can confirm that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, will come to the House next Wednesday following the Order of Business to discuss this matter.  It is important we have a full debate on the matter and that we understand the complexities of the issue.  <\/p><p>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins raised the issue of the Joint Committee on Social Protection report.  As a House, we should look at how we can debate committee reports.  Having previously been a chairman of a committee I know that committees are an industrious, productive and constructive part of our work as Members of the Oireachtas.  Sometimes reports are published, they get one or two headlines in a newspaper, or none, and they disappear into the ether and are forgotten about.  I would like if we could set aside time in our schedule to debate Oireachtas committee reports.  A former Ceann Comhairle, Se&aacute;n Barrett, was very supportive of Oireachtas committee reports being debated in both Houses.  I would be happy to facilitate Senator Higgins's request.  I am equally happy to ask a Minister come to the House to discuss the sustainable development goals.  Senator Higgins is correct that it is important that we live up to our expectations and that we do not only sign documents and aspire to get to that point buy go beyond it.  <\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in asked about the status of the Schools Admission Bill.  I do not propose to engage in a row with the Senator on the matter.  The Bill will be before the D&aacute;il next week.  I am informed that the Minister will propose a number of Committee Stage amendments following which the Bill will come back to the Seanad.  Also, I congratulate Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on his selection as a D&aacute;il candidate for the next general election. <\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, of children under 12 being allowed free access to cultural and heritage sites.  Last week, I had the pleasure of having two visitors in Ireland from the United States.  We visited a number of OPW sites.  The OPW heritage card, which costs approximately &euro;40, covers adult admission to many wonderful sites.  Everyone should have one.  The visit to the Rock of Cashel was tremendous.  The work being done by the OPW in terms of upgrading and preserving key parts of the site in Cashel deserves to be commended.  I commend all in the OPW for the work they are doing.<\/p><p>Senators Gallagher and Paul Daly raised the important issue of farm safety.  Senator Daly made the very good point that while the budget has been cut the current allocation in respect of farm safety is significant.  As stated by the Senators, farming is the highest risk category in terms of accidents and deaths.  Any death is regrettable and any accident is hugely problematic.  We sympathise with the people who have died and their families.  We must ensure we are getting value for money.  If the case is made for an increase in the budget it will be considered.  It is important that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, has the power to carry out inspections.  I have experience in this area, having had a family member involved in an accident on farm.  This year, the HSA will carry out inspections around animal handling, machinery and work carried out at height.  The farming organisations and farmers need to work together to ensure the risks are reduced.  The Senators are right that a lot of work remains to be done.  I will endeavour to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter.  <\/p><p>The Seanad Public Consultation Committee, and Senator Conway as its rapporteur, produced a report on farm safety that needs to be built on.  As I said earlier, it is important that we learn from reports and recommendations.  While I do not wish to be critical of anyone officials can put all sorts of barriers in the way of initiatives.  There is a need for leadership in regard to some of the issues that have been raised by Senators Daly and Gallagher today.  I will be happy to schedule a debate in the House on those issues.<\/p><p>Senators Gallagher and Feighan congratulated the volunteers of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael on their handling and hosting of F&eacute;ile na Gael in Cavan, Monaghan and Fermanagh.  As a former Cork county youth officer I know that F&eacute;ile na Gael is the weekend all young boys and girls aspire to participate in.  I thank the host families and the men and women of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael for their tremendous work last week.  It was clear from some of the photographs I saw over the weekend and on Monday morning that there was huge celebrations across the country in many clubs.  I thank everybody who was involved.<\/p><p>Senator Marie-Louse O'Donnell referred to the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.  As the Senator will be aware, the schedule in terms of debate on the Bill by the Seanad is not available yet as the Bill has only commenced proceedings in the Lower House.  This matter was also raised yesterday on the Order of Business, when I said that I do not envisage the guillotine being imposed but I cannot confirm that it will not be imposed.  I said yesterday in response to Senator McDowell that the Seanad has a constitutional obligation to scrutinise legislation, to amend it if necessary or to allow it remain as drafted.  I do not propose to rush passage of the Bill through this House.  The matter will be discussed by the Leaders and Groups meeting, as has always been the case in regard to legislation since I became Leader.  I also said yesterday that we cannot allow a situation whereby one, two or three people grandstand and filibuster such that the Bill will end up in the ether.  Equally, I will not fast-track the Bill through this House.  As I said, that discussion will be had at the Leaders and Groups meetings.  As members who attend that meeting will know, I am reasonably flexible and I work with people.  It is a two-way street: I give and there is take.  I will come back to the Senator when I know the Government's intent of amendments, if any.  I cannot give a commitment today on the matter but I am prepared to work with the House to ensure we have a real, meaningful debate on Second, Committee and Report Stages. <\/p><p>In regard to the Western Development Commission and the resignation of the chairperson, I will be happy to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, come to the House for a debate on that issue.  Senator Feighan raised the issue of the European Medicines Agency.  Former Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran-Kennedy, along with the Minister, Deputy Harris, were very involved in trying to bring the agency to Ireland.  This matter was raised previously by Senator Colm Burke, who want it relocated to Cork, Senator Richmond who wanted it relocated to Dublin and Senator Feighan who wanted it relocated to the west.  What is important is that it is located in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#L01400","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#M00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>In regard to the issue raised by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, as stated by the Cathaoirleach, I do not have any jurisdiction over translation services although the Senator is correct that any issue that impairs the work of the House must be resolved.

I certainly have mine which have been well documented as I made a submission to the commission.  It is disappointing that there is to be no change in Cork but <i>c'est la vie<\/i>.  It is, however, a missed opportunity and it is a matter to which I will come back when the report is debated by the House, if we are still here.  We may not be part of the next general election at all.  Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor may have to go into a part of County Wicklow, but that is another day's work.  Senator Terry Leyden said people would be disenfranchised, which will continue to the case in the city of Cork, which is disappointing.  Bishopstown has been divided in two.  The Senator was correct to highlight the fact that communities have different voices, but there is no unity, which is disappointing.<br\/><br\/>Senator Catherine Noone referred to the Royal Irish Society public health debate and raised a very interesting point.  Social media have become an integral part of the lives of young people, whether it be Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook or whatever the new fad is.  This is putting pressure on them.  I will be happy to have a debate on social media.<br\/><br\/>Senators David Norris and Colm Burke referred to the Private Members' Bill to be debated today.  It is important that it not be allowed to vanish.  I implore all Members to speak to it as it is an important Bill.  None of us wants anyone to lose his or her home and be discommoded or evicted.  To be fair to the Senators, they have raised very important and interesting points about how we should work together to ensure people will not have to face the ignominy of losing their homes or being evicted.  It is important that people work together and that the institutions of the State and the banks work with them.  I am very anxious, therefore, to ensure the Bill will not vanish today and implore all Members to support Senator David Norris.<br\/><br\/>Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn referred to the Irish language Act, an issue I have addressed, as well as the very important report of the expert panel on concrete blocks.  I have asked the Minister responsible to come to the House to discuss the issue which was raised by Senator Michelle Mulherin two weeks ago.  The request has been submitted.  The Senator is correct.  It is an issue which has vexed residents in counties Donegal and Mayo, in particular.  The Senator's constituency colleague, the Chief Whip, Deputy Joe McHugh, has already spoken to me about the matter in the context of redress.  The Senator was correct to raise the matter today.  We dealt with the issue of pyrite and we can do the same again in this instance.  It is a matter of finding a way around things.<br\/><br\/>Senator Colm Burke referred to the Bill before the House and the need to hold people to account, such as in the case of the HSE.  I agree with him.<br\/><br\/>Senator M&aacute;ire Devine made reference to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I gave a comprehensive reply yesterday when the matter was raised on the Order of Business by a colleague, Senator Rose Conway-Walsh.  None of us can be complacent on the issue of safety, whether it be in high rise units or multi-unit accommodation.  Other than Priory Hall, we do not seem to have a litany of buildings being condemned, but if I am wrong, I will come back and retract my remarks.  I would hate people to think we have had no controls or standards in buildings in the past decade.  The Minister was speaking on a radio programme about buildings in Ireland not having the same density as those in London.  We must ensure we speak with one voice when we say there can be no dilution of standards or shortcuts.  We learned from the fire which occurred on St. Valentine's Day in Dublin in 1981.  We must now learn from the fire that occurred in London.  I agree with the Senator in that regard.  The report to be issued on 19 July must be acted on.  I do not buy the line that resources are not available to carry out inspections.  They are happening.  We must ensure the reports from each local authority and the Residential Tenancies Board are acted on, if deficiencies are identified.  We cannot err on the side of finance.  We must prioritise the lives and safety of all those affected.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Ned O'Sullivan referred to examinations and correctors in the context of the State Examinations Commission.  The issue was not highlighted after the junior and leaving certificate examinations; rather, it happened during the recruitment process.  Like the Senator, I was an invigilator and corrector and wish all of our colleagues well as they get their sample papers together to hand to superintendents.  The Senator is correct.  There is a need for integrity in marking and the highest of standards must prevail in the correction of examination papers because the lives of so many students depend on the outcome.  I share the Senator's view in that regard.  If the State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education and Skills need to carry out a review of remuneration, correctors and the process involved, we should examine that possibility.  <br\/><br\/>I cannot give my good friend Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell a definitive answer, but I will be happy to work with all Members of the House to ensure there will not be a quick passage of the Bill and alacrity in dealing with.

The other aspect that might have created problems is the question of property rights.  In light of the fact that the public good in the Constitution trumps every other right, I have never understood why Governments have not had the guts to appeal to the public good in passing legislation.<\/p><p>I pay particular tribute to two persons: Ed Honohan, who produced the Bill, and Deputy John McGuinness, who is in the process of introducing it in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

We will not try to rush it through.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The debate has been allocated one hour and 45 minutes and the Bill will be left in suspended animation on the Order Paper in order that it can be continued because we believe in co-operation.  This issue is a disaster facing this country.  If members of the public realised what was coming down the line, they would be in a panic.  The authorities cannot deal with 7,000 people being homeless.  They are incapable of dealing with that.  What happens when that number increases to 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 people, as will surely happen when Allied Irish Banks, under the instructions of the European Central Bank, unloads the distressed mortgages?  I would like to put in the figures but I cannot give any definite figures because there is quite a range of figures available to people.  In terms of people's right to a home, the number of accounts is 60,000, the number of people directly affected is about 250,000, and the total debt outstanding is &euro;14 billion.  I cannot confirm that because there is a dearth of demographic and statistical information.  One of the first things we need to do is to scope the complete dimension of the problem.  However, we have some figures from the Central Bank.  On 31 March this year, there was a total of &euro;8.8 billion in outstanding balances on mortgages in arrears for more than an year on private homes, covering 41,000 accounts in total.  The total in arrears on private homes came to &euro;2.6 billion.  In March of this year, private home accounts in arrears for more than a year made up 5.6% of all residential mortgage accounts.  Clearly, we have a very serious problem facing this country.<\/p><p>Have people forgotten that eviction is a dirty word in this country?  Charles Stewart Parnell and Michael Davitt throughout the 19th century fought against eviction.  I find it astonishing that an Irish Republic should stand over eviction, and not only that but that it should invite the vulture funds into this country to buy up the slack and make a profit out of it.  There is no other motive in vulture funds, other than vulgar profiteering.  What has happened here, just as at the time of the Famine, is that a rigid economic theory is being implemented as if we were some kind of a laboratory experiment but we are dealing with real people.  We are dealing with human misery.  We are dealing with people who for years have been tortured by financial worries.  When I look at the European Central Bank it makes me grimace.  These were the people who illegally forced this country into redeeming the bonds of bondholders and taking on board the gambling debts of the Irish banks, and then they turned around and did precisely the opposite in Cyprus, so there was no principle involved.  We paid out &euro;65 billion.  The bondholders were laughing all the way to the banks.  Some of them bought up the bonds at 5% of their face value and the Irish taxpayer was forced to redeem them at 100% of their face value.  When the vulture funds move into this country, take over the distressed mortgages and evict people, guess what the cherry on the pie is.  The Irish taxpayer will be presented with the bill for the evictions.  They can be very costly, involving the cost of helicopters, the police, the sheriff's office, dogs - the whole works.  It is like forcing the Jews to pay for their own execution during the Second World War.  It is an absolute disgrace.  To think that the Government gave them charitable status, what in the name of Christ is charitable about the vulture funds?  They were given that status so they do not have to pay tax.  They got away with &euro;77 million in profits and they did not pay a single red cent to the Irish taxpayer under their deeds.<\/p><p>I find this quite an extraordinary situation for any Government in which to find itself.  I am very glad the Green Party, People before Profit and all the small parties have supported this Bill.  I have spoken to my friends and my colleagues about this Bill.  Senator Colm Burke said on the Order of Business this morning that this was a very important Bill, that there were things wrong with it, which I accept, but that it should be debated in this House and left on the Order Paper.  All the smaller parties support it.  I have spoken to my friends in the major parties and they have all agreed in principle with this Bill.  How could they do anything else?  That wonderful man, the Jesuit, Fr. Peter McVerry, said he did not know how anybody in Ireland could not support this Bill.  It is inarguable; there is no case against it.  The Bill is not perfect.  It is intended to start a discussion on this issue.<\/p><p>What has happened here can be seen right across the Continent of Europe and in United States of America, and it is the reason Donald Trump got elected and it is the reason for Brexit.  At the time of the financial crisis when this was just beginning I asked the Government to institute a Minister for home protection, not homeland protection, not a neurotic reaction to a perceived terrorist threat, but a reaction to the threat of people being evicted from their homes, a Minister for home protection to ensure Irish citizens would have a roof over their heads.  Ireland is unusual in Europe in that we have a very large amount of home ownership.  There is a something in Ireland about land and about people having their own home, not renting but owning their home and having that to which to go home.<\/p><p>With regard to the banks, they have learned nothing.  They are precisely the same as they were before the financial crisis.  The banks have taken it upon themselves to close down campaigns.  I will not specify all of them but the Ireland Palestinian Solidarity Campaign is one.  It was a good decent peaceful campaigning organisation but the banks decided unilaterally to close down its accounts.  They have also closed down the accounts of some embassies in Ireland.  That was bloody high-handed of them, in particular given the Government has such a large stake in these banks.  They also started charging outrageous and illegal interest rates, which forced some people into losing their homes and some people into losing their lives.  I remember at the beginning of this crisis somebody saying fatuously: \" Well, nobody lost their life.\"  Quite a few people, put under this enormous financial terror, have taken the ultimate step to take their own lives.<\/p><p>This Bill proposes to create a new agency, a national housing co-operative, which will move in when groups like Allied Irish Banks unload this enormous number of shares, creating a possible avalanche of homelessness.  The housing co-operative will take over the distressed mortgages at the current level of value.  It will then rent them back or remortgage them to the original owners in order that they can stay in their houses.  That is a really good response.<\/p><p>I do not understand how the bloody vulture funds got into this country in the first place and how they were given this privileged status.  I like the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan.  He has been an admirable, honourable politician, but I do not know how anybody could say that vultures were a good idea because they cleaned up corpses.  I cannot understand how any Minister in an Irish Government could make such a gaffe.  What we are talking about here is not a bird, snake or animal corpse but the corpse of the well-being of Irish citizens.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am happy to move this Bill, particularly in a period when somebody like Mike Allen, director of advocacy at Focus Ireland, says that no strategy to tackle our housing crisis can succeed unless it stems the flow of families losing their homes on a daily basis.  In Dublin this year, over 70 families a month lost their homes.  Let us just think about that.  That means 70 ordinary families losing their homes.<br\/><br\/>I will finish on this as I understand that I have a few minutes left.  The capital required would be secured by a 20-year bond secured against the properties and we believe that we would have the backing of major international financial institutions to do so.  This is because long-term 20-year loans are at a uniquely low level and the financial institutions are looking for something good that is guaranteed to take up.  It is for that reason that this Bill creates no charge on the Exchequer.  <br\/><br\/>We should ashamed of ourselves as an Oireachtas if we do not take on this issue.  I would like to quote Edmund Honohan, Master of the High Court, when he addressed us in both Houses of the Oireachtas.

I am delighted to second it and to have been asked to do so.  Let us add some context here.  What are we talking about?  The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of an industrial and provident society we call the national housing co-operative society.  This society would have the mandate and powers to acquire, manage, rent or sell distressed mortgages so that the occupants of houses can move from the status of distressed mortgagor by means of a mortgage to possibly a rent and mortgage.  It is important that we get that context right.<\/p> <p>Senator Norris mentioned facts and details on this matter.  I got an email this morning from a contact who had been in touch with the Central Bank.  These are the latest figures, which I will now share with the House.  A total of 278 homes were repossessed in the first quarter of this year.  We also know that 1,645 legal proceedings have been issued for the repossession of family homes in that first quarter.  It is important to quantify some figures around this debate so as to get some sense of its urgency and importance.<\/p> <p>I was struck by two simple words used by Senator Norris, namely, \"financial terror\".  I think that brings the message home clearly.  We all know friends, members of our family and colleagues who have lived in terror every day as they try to honourably meet their financial commitments to hold and secure a roof over their heads and those of their family and loved ones.  That is a noble cause and one which should be supported by everybody in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Everyone has a right to a home.  The consequence of doing nothing is that thousands of people will end up on our social housing list when we already have a national housing crisis.  It is imperative that the Government steps in through a mechanism like this Bill and tries to give some support to people who genuinely need it.  <\/p> <p>It is also very important that this not be seen by anybody outside this House as some form of charter for those who can pay but will not do so.  It is important that we get this message out.  There are people who can pay but choose not to, who do not want to discharge their honourable debt to honourable financial institutions.  This is a really important line.  We are trying to deal here with vulnerable people in their own family homes.  Senator Norris's Bill sets that out very clearly.  Since the financial crisis in 2007, the level of home mortgage arrears has reached alarming levels with serious social and economic consequences.  An urgent intervention is required to stem these expensive and exceptional circumstances, as well as the expensive litigation involved in taking actions through the courts to effectively evict people from their homes.  If people are driven from their homes for inability to pay the mortgage, both the social and economic implications for this country are devastating.  <\/p> <p>The National Housing Co-operative Bill 2017 seeks to resolve the difficulties facing home owners with mortgage arrears and to find and broker resolutions and solutions to prevent people from being turfed out of their homes by the banks and vulture funds.  It is envisaged that the national housing co-operative, when established, will purchase the properties and related debt from the various lending bodies.  This will be subject, of course, to a degree of nuance and change and this is where the legislation is perhaps somewhat weak.  As Senator Norris has said, however, this Bill is to kick-start the issue and get the debate going.  He has indicated that the Bill is open for amendments to make this better legislation.  It is incumbent on us as parliamentarians to bring proposals forward and to draw on the expertise and knowledge across all parties and none in order to make this better legislation.  That is our job and we should settle for nothing less. <\/p> <p>Significant benefits would flow from this Bill.  Most people would be able to remain in their homes and would have greater security of tenure.  Repossessions would be limited to very exceptional circumstances.  I reiterate that those who can but will not pay should get no comfort from this legislation.  That is really important.<\/p> <p>I will conclude by sharing some more facts.  We need to deal with facts and figures if we want to get to the bottom of this issue and put in place meaningful and proper measures such as this Bill attempts to do.  I quote from figures released by the Central Bank in June 2017.  These figures indicate that the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses further fell in the first quarter of 2017.   This has to be welcomed.  This marks the 15th consecutive quarter of decline.  A total of 76,422 accounts were in arrears at the end of March, still a significant number, amounting to a decline of 1.4%.  There is a decline then, and we know why that is happening, but the number is still very significant.  The number of mortgage accounts classified as restructured by the end of March came to a total of 120,894.  That is very telling.<\/p> <p>Let us make this personal.  We all know neighbours, friends and colleagues who are only paying interest-only mortgages.  This is unsustainable and cannot go on.  There is a crisis and we need to understand that.  The Central Bank figures also mention the number of buy-to-let mortgage accounts in arrears.  As of March these amount to 24,500, which is a phenomenal figure. <\/p> <p>I point out to the Minister of State that financial terror has reigned over so many people.  So many people's lives have been destroyed.  So many people were unable to go on living because of this terrible crisis over mortgages and homes.  So many people bought their first family home with great expectation and pride for that was to be their family homestead.  That has fallen away for so many people.  We owe it to them to do something here.  <\/p> <p>I will conclude by thanking Senator Norris for setting out this Bill and for inviting people to add and detract from it and make it better legislation.  For far too long politicians from both of these Houses have belly-ached on the radio and in the media about distressed mortgages and the financial ruin that people have suffered as a result.  It is time to speak up and be accountable, to put their words into action and come to this House to support this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#Q00700","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Senator Murnane O'Connor has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#R00100","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill in principle, however, we believe it is incomplete.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il's position on mortgage arrears is that every effort should be made to keep families in their home.  It has been ten years since the onset of the financial crisis but no sustainable long-term solution has come from the Fine Gael-led Governments to tackle the issue and assist families in genuine mortgage arrears.  That is a fact.  Fianna F&aacute;il published a mortgage resolution office Bill in 2013, which would have allowed an independent office to assist families.  The previous Fine Gael Government rejected it, as its preference was to allow the banks to retain a veto.  This discouraged families from engaging with the banks to resolve their mortgage difficulties, as they believed the banks did not have their best interest at heart.  Even though there has been a very slight decrease in those in mortgage arrears for more than two years, there are still 33,000 homes in mortgage distress and in the past two years there has been a worrying increase in the number of mortgages that are in arrears for more than 90 days.  This remains a major challenge. <\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il is bringing forward a Bill on mortgage arrears resolution, called the Mortgage Arrears Resolution (Family Home) Bill 2017.  Deputy Michael McGrath is moving the First Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il today.  I know a group has been working on the Bill for the past few months.  This campaign led by Fianna F&aacute;il to remove the veto power from the banks and other lenders has been ongoing for a number of years but Fine Gael has refused to budge.  It is still said by MABS and personal insolvency practitioners that the biggest hurdle is dealing with mortgage lenders.  This new Bill would use the current insolvency mechanism, but it would remove the banks' veto.  It would force the lender to come up with a sustainable long-term solution.  If the lenders do not come up with a solution, then the mortgage resolution office, which is under the personal insolvency service, will create a mortgage resolution order.  This would involve the office coming up with a sustainable long-term solution and allow families to stay in their homes.<\/p> <p>Fianna Fail supports the principle of keeping people in the family home and while it supports the intention of the National Housing Co-operative Bill 2017, there are some very serious questions and concerns that need to be addressed.  While well intentioned, the Bill lacks clarity and at a minimum requires the availability of &euro;5 billion and the recruitment of at least 300 staff.  In debating this legislation we have been absolutely honest and clear about what is possible in the context of the Bill.  As it stands the Bill will be stopped before it enters D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as it will not receive a money message.  Opposition parties or groupings are prevented under Article 17.2 of the Constitution from passing legislation that involves significant cost.  From reading the Bill, it is clear that it is a money Bill and only the Government can proceed with a money Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#R00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>It is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#R00300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>It is estimated that the co-operative will have to raise at least &euro;5 billion.  If this money is to be raised through bonds, as was the case with NAMA, this will ultimately have to be guaranteed by the State.  The Bill, as drafted, it is not clear on the function of the co-operative.  It is unclear from the Bill whether the homeowner is activating the process or not, and how much control the home owner has in this process.  That is a significant issue.  There is such a lack of clarity that many issues have to be resolved.  Under the mortgage-to-rent scheme, for all its flaws, the home owner must initiate the process.<\/p> <p>This Bill is also unclear about whether the house or the debt is sold.  In NAMA's case, the loans were purchased at a discount and the bonds used to fund NAMA were guaranteed by the State.  It is unclear whether the co-operative will become a landlord or a landowner.  For example, the Long Title refers to the possibility of the co-operative renting distressed mortgages.  This again highlights the incompleteness of the Bill.  In some cases the Bill suggests that home owners will have to give up their house but remain in debt.  This certainly would not serve the home owner.  It is unclear what the co-operative will actually own, whether the house, the loan or both.  It is unclear what the homeowner is giving up.  Given that the co-operative will need State support in terms of guarantees, the lack of clarity over the function of the Bill is likely to cost the State and the home owner.  Evidence suggests that repossession is currently not the primary issue, it is typically the steps before that point that are causing stress among home owners.  <\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il is today bringing forward the Mortgage Arrears Resolution (Family Home) Bill 2017.

We have a housing crisis.  We have people losing their homes.  However, I believe that Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Independents, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party need to work to make sure that people will have the chance to remain in their homes.

This Bill was before the Oireachtas Joint Committee Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach a short time ago and I see the committee Chairman, Deputy John McGuinness, in the Gallery.<\/p> <p>I have had time to reflect on the Bill.  I asked myself the following questions.  Do we have a problem with people with mortgages?  The answer is \"Yes\".  Why have we a problem?  It is a legacy issue.  In the years 2005 to 2007 many people bought houses at an astronomical cost because the property market was allowed to run on unchecked.  We are talking about responsibility.  Fianna F&aacute;il has to take a share of the responsibility for that.<\/p> <p>The issue is how to address this problem now.  The Bill before us is about effectively addressing the issue in terms of the vulture funds, a view which I share.  We need to take a serious look at how the banks dispose of their loans.  From the discussions I would have had with people who are involved in property and in property rental, there are concerns in the Dublin market about the level of control some of the vulture funds have in the property market.  We need to look at this issue.  Perhaps we need to introduce controls in the market.  We cannot have a situation where a large group has some sort of control over property rentals. <\/p> <p>I have a number of questions on what is proposed in this Bill.  It has been stated that the State will have to underwrite the funding.  It may be regarded as another mini-NAMA.  The structure is not that different.

The most significant issue in the housing market at present is the level of supply.  The Bill does nothing to address the issue of supply, but basically deals with a group who have distressed loans with the banks.  The other issue the Bill does not address, is the issue of sustainable mortgages.  The problem is that people bought three bedroom, semi-detached houses up and down the country, and took out mortgages for close to &euro;300,000.  This was crazy.  It was not sustainable to service such a mortgage.  If the loan is moved to a national housing co-operative, the entire debt on the house is moved.  The banks must come to a resolution.  If the debt is written down to what is regarded as a recoverable amount, the banks have already taken the hit on their balance sheet.  Why should they be selling the debt on to somebody else?  Why should we not come up with a mechanism where the bank can deal with the individual mortgage holder?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is much doublespeak going on here in that, ultimately, it suits the banks to sell loans in large numbers and not have to deal with the issue.  I would put it a different way.  We have bailed out the banks at considerable cost.  Even with &euro;14 billion of face-value book loans purchased at &euro;5 billion of a write-down value, it is &euro;9 billion that the taxpayer has already bailed out.  When I speak about the taxpayer I am talking about the citizen, the person on social welfare who is paying VAT on goods purchased.  These people pay excise duty on drinks and cigarettes.  It is the holistic meaning of the term \"citizen\".  They have already paid for it.  The question is whether the solution lies within banks.<\/p><p>This has brought about at a critical time a discussion around how we deal with what we know colloquially as vulture funds but what are large investors in multiple loans sold by banks.  The discussion is about how we deal with them selling home and residential loans, not to mention small business loans.  We must consider whether banks must step up to the plate and accept their share of responsibility in giving mortgages to people.  They were being doled out like confetti.  I was elected as a councillor in 2004 and met people who got mortgages they should not have got.  Everything was set up to give mortgages to those people.  We have a very fundamental idea instilled in us, referenced by Senator Norris, in that we value the ownership of our home and we see it as an aspiration of everybody to enable somebody else to own a home.  Even if this goes to a co-operative, it does not change the basis for a home owner, who still has a full loan and may end up as a tenant.  These people may never own their home.  We need to find a structure to enable people to own their home.  The banks are doing write-offs so they can be sustainable.  They have already done the write-off on their balance sheet as it is.<\/p><p>I have a few points on the structure of the Bill.  I referred to this in the finance committee and I am trying to be constructive.  I am working from the view that we are now at a juncture where we must look at maintaining people in their homes and, additionally, getting them back to being in control of the purchase of their homes over time.  The co-operative can either buy the loan or the property.  If the co-operative buys the property, the individual would remain as a tenant.  Such people would not own the house, despite living in it before.  They would probably be entitled to a form of rent supplement or housing assistance payment, and the State would effectively be paying for it.  The worry would be that the national housing co-operative would create another residential mini-NAMA.  We need to move beyond that and put the responsibility back on the banks to sort out the mess they created so people can remain in homes.<\/p><p>The mortgage-to-rent and other schemes must be examined again to see if they are fit for purpose.  The worry is there are many questions about funding and this does not bring about any increase in supply or lead to sustainable mortgages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#R01000","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>The houses are on the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#S00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>It is something we must address and the banks must deal with it.

I acknowledge its attempts to stop the tide of citizens and families being turfed out on the streets.  It was apt earlier when Senator Norris spoke about evictions, because that is what they were.  As legislators, we are facing the question of whether the Government will continue to condone evictions.  My party and I certainly cannot stand over that.<\/p> <p>This is not a perfect Bill but we do not deal with perfect Bills.  We get Bills and we do our best to make them perfect through various stages of scrutiny and debate.  I am glad Senators Norris and Boyhan have said they would welcome amendments.  Today, it is all about the principles and spirit of the Bill, and it is a spirit I am very happy to support.  My party has brought legislative proposals before aimed at giving borrowers a chance, at least.  For example, our land and conveyancing reform Bill in 2013 could have made a huge difference but, sadly, it was rejected.  The same old Government line has triumphed since in that the banks must come first and the borrower and rights of consumers are bottom of the list.  We have seen this in delays dealing with the tracker mortgage debacle, which I see as a crime.  The closure of rural facilities and the flotation of AIB reflect the attitudes of banks and them never being reined in to be held accountable.  When we invite representatives of banks before the finance committee, we have seen even in the past number of weeks that they have refused.  The excuse of the partial flotation of AIB has been used, with all the other banks trotting out the same lines that they will not come in for a number of months.  That is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>That is the mentality that has us in this position and it must change.  The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, rolled out the red carpet to vulture funds.  This time last year, I put to him at the economic dialogue gathering as to whether he had quantified exactly the amount of money lost through the sweetheart deals he was giving to vulture funds.  He never addressed the matter and he saw those funds as a solution.  I certainly never agreed with him in that respect and they are part of the problem.  Vultures do not kill but they prey on the carrion.  These funds actively kill off small businesses and attack owners.  They are predators rather than simply vultures.<\/p> <p>As has been noted, there is an idea in Ireland about land and home ownership that we should cherish.  There is also a history in Ireland of corruption, cronyism and protection of the golden circle.  We can consider the &euro;67 billion given to the banks we are here to speak about and we forget that we are paying &euro;7 billion or more every year just to service that debt.  It is &euro;7 billion that could be used on physiotherapy and health or other services that people are in desperate need of around this country.  We should all be clear that the banks got away with it and continue to do so.  That is why what we are discussing today is so important.  <\/p> <p>Some people tell us there is a low rate of repossession in this country but that ignores the so-called voluntary surrenders and, more importantly, the context.  The same banks wrecked the country, destroyed the economy and made tens of thousands of people unemployed, as well as forcing people towards emigration.  We are now speaking as if everything is okay and we have full employment.  Nevertheless, I come from an area with unemployment rates of more than 30%.  How can that be explained?  The banks have gotten away with the major part they played in bringing that about.<\/p> <p>As people have try to recover, the banks have come knocking on the door, saying that we owe them.  We have it backwards.  In a normal context this Bill would be unnecessary.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There will always be a small number in society, as alluded to, who through bad luck will fail to repay their mortgage.  There will also be a number of people who can pay but will not do so, in respect of whom there must be the possibility of a threat.  When we have a societal and economic issue of this scale, a different approach is needed, but the conservative powers in the State simply cannot contemplate that type of action.  That is the crux of the problem.  They promised limited actions, but even are not being taken.  A review of thresholds and the processes for the personal insolvency arrangements, including SMEs, to raise them, where appropriate, was promised.  The establishment of a dedicated new court was also promised, but, again, that has not happened.  The Government promised to work with the Central Bank to amend the code of conduct for mortgage arrears, but that, too, has not happened.  All of these things have not happened because of the policy that the banks must come first, but they have never been held to account.  It is excruciating to witness their arrogance and the benign attitude the Government has shown towards their behaviour, but they could not care less about citizens because they know that there are no sanctions and that the close knit elite will not bring their friends to account.  They also know that there are no sanctions against those who engage in white collar crime and they have had all of the evidence they need even in recent weeks.  <\/p><p>There are questions about initial financing and the way a co-op would operate.  We will, therefore, need information as the Bill progresses.  A lot of work will need to be done to iron out the concept until it resembles what is a living entity.  My party is prepared to put in the hard work with others as these are societal and economic issues that need to be addressed.  It is not just a banking issue, even though we have concentrated on the banks today, but we have a duty to act.  However, we must also act responsibility and consider the full consequences of our actions.  The Bill should progress and Sinn F&eacute;in will support it on this Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#S00600","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I express a huge \"thank you\" to Senator David Norris for spearheading the Bill.  It shows once again his humanitarian and caring nature and activist role.  I also recognise the work done by Deputy John McGuinness who is in the Visitors Gallery.  I thank all of the housing and citizens' groups which have supported Senator David Norris in his wish to bring forward the Bill.<\/p> <p>This is a housing issue.  Everyone present probably has experience of family members being harassed by the banks in the past few years; therefore, they know how people's confidence can be destroyed.  People have received telephone calls from banks on a daily basis.  Pressure has been put on individuals, families and their children.  The distress caused has been shocking, atrocious and totally unacceptable.  The Bill will go some way towards addressing the problem.<\/p> <p>In the past year the Civil Engagement group, of which I am part, has focused heavily on the housing crisis.  Last year I introduced the Vacant and Derelict Sites Bill as a means of tackling the ever expanding housing waiting lists.  The aim of the Bill before the House is to prevent homelessness from occurring in the first place.  It should, therefore, be well supported and commended.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, I have advocated for much stronger action by the Government to end homelessness and tackle the catastrophic rise in rents, particularly in the Dublin region.  Since the beginning the Civil Engagement group has focused on adopting a social approach to housing.  We view it not as an investment but as a right.  We want to see strong action being taken by the State and locally to deal with the issue.  An important part of our approach is the principle contained in the Bill to protect those who are already in homes.  The new Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has admitted that the Government will not meet its target to house Ireland's homeless and get them out of hotels and other emergency care settings.  The former Minister had ambitious targets and it is sad that they have not been met.  I hope the Bill will go some way to protecting those who are slipping into homelessness.  Prevention is better than cure.  Society would be much better served if we were to find a way to help people to stay in their homes rather than try to assist them after they have lost them.<\/p> <p>On the insolvency laws and vulture funds, the Bill aims to give a fresh start to borrowers, to allow mortgagees or borrowers to buy their mortgage debt from the banks and create a new co-operative society that will rely on the European Investment Bank in providing the funding required to buy secured loans from lenders.  The Green Party supports the principles behind the Bill.  Certain points need to be teased out and I hope that will happen in the coming weeks.  I agree, in particular, with the aim of the Bill to deal with the issue of insolvency and tackle the parasitic vulture funds in Ireland.  The housing crisis is being seen purely as a financial issue, but that mindset must be turned around.  The Bill should be about providing support which I believe is the approach proposed by Senator David Norris.  My party wholeheartedly supports the Bill on this Stage.  I look forward to making further inputs as it passes through the different Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#T00200","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I welcome the new Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  This is the first opportunity I have had to be in his presence since his appointment and I congratulate him on his promotion.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the Bill before us and Senator David Norris's input into it.  It deals with an important matter that affects so many members of society.  There are issues in the housing market that need to be addressed.  How they are addressed will be key in how we address societal issues.  For me, the key issue is the lack of supply and house building.  The former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the new Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, have made moves to address the key issues involved.  Lack of supply is one of the key issues we must tackle in order that we will again have an active housing market.  Some infrastructure has been built to open up sites, but lack of State investment in infrastructure and the need for a direct input into social housing schemes are key issues that need to be addressed in order that we can increase housing supply.<\/p> <p>The Bill tries to deal with legacy issues.  Perhaps we might put a small version of NAMA in place or ask the banking industry to deal with them.  How we address them and get everyone on board will be key in solving the housing problem.  Some people have struggled badly in the past few years and we need to ensure a process will be put in place to help them.  There have always been people who struggled but yet managed to pay their way.  We need to ensure we will bring such persons with us also.  It is, therefore, a balancing act.<\/p> <p>Trying to access credit and a credit rating are key issues in the housing market.  There is an issue for people on the so-called working wage in taking out mortgages to enable them to access the market.  From my point of view, the key issue is the lack of supply.  We need to build more houses and open up the market.  If we do so, I hope we will share the ambition of ensuring everyone will be able to own his or her home.  We must ensure people will have an opportunity to invest.  That is what most people want.  They want to own their own home.

If the Minister of State wants to deal with supply, there are mechanisms that can be used.  We are trying to reduce demand.

Senator Kieran O'Donnell said we do not want it to happen again, but all the signs are there that it is happening again.  Young people are becoming more and more pressurised.  They are not even that young; they are in their early 30s.

People are left saddled with debt.  We also have families that might have lost their jobs, that have small amounts left on their mortgages and whose houses are worth quite a substantial amount, and banks are forcing them through the courts system even though the amount left on the mortgage is minimal compared to the value of the house.  This is absolutely unfair.  It does not matter how much one's house cost; if one has been there for 20 years, reared a family and invested a lot in one's area and community, one should not be forced through the courts system and the strain of being evicted, as has been referred to, from one's family home.

People are talking more about investment property.  There is talk of going back to relaxing the mortgage credit lending rules, which I do not agree with.  We saw from 2003 to 2007 that 100% mortgages were being given to people who had absolutely no income and perhaps no possibility of any income in the future.  We must, therefore, be very mindful of not relaxing the credit rules, instead introducing measures that will increase supply.  Fianna F&aacute;il has looked at measures relating to VAT, planning and certification rules.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are ways of reducing the cost of building houses and ways of increasing supply.  We also discussed the \"use or it lose it\" tax on land.  There are many plots of land around the city which are left vacant, with owners sitting on them and not building because they are waiting for even more inflated prices, although they do not know when they are going to come.  I think it is very unfair to have these vacant sites around the city, where people want to live.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il is this week bringing in a mortgage arrears resolution Bill.  One of the plans brought in by this Government was the PIP, or professional insolvency practitioner.  The main reason this measure failed was because banks were given a veto on whether to implement the PIP plans.  From the outset, there was an outcry that this was not going to work and, lo and behold, it did not work.  I do not believe the PIP plan was the solution.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Bill will get rid of the banks' veto and will bring in a more streamlined courts system.  I welcome this Bill and hope it will go some way towards helping people stay in their homes.<\/p><p>I am glad to support Senator Norris's Bill in some shape or form and I commend him on bringing it to the House.  As he said, the real elephant in the room is supply.  I do not think the number of people affected by arrears will be increasing from now on and the number seems to be slowly decreasing.  At the same time, they are there and it will be very hard for them to get out of that trap.  In the short and medium term, their situation will not get better unless Bills like this give them a chance to move on.  We are a First World country.  We should not have people who are almost imprisoned by their mortgage as this affects not only their family life but also their mental health.  It is wrong that this would happen in this day and age.  I again commend Senator Norris and I commend my colleague, Deputy McGuinness, and the others in the Visitors Gallery who have been spearheading this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#U00900","speaker":"1407","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":149,"content":"<p>D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeachas leis an Aire St&aacute;it nua, an Teachta D'Arcy.  Go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Norris agus an Teachta D&aacute;la McGuinness as ucht an Bhille an-th&aacute;bhachtaigh seo.  In welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, to the House, it is my first chance to congratulate my friend and colleague and to wish him well in his new Department and new brief.  It is a very important Bill that we are discussing this afternoon.  I congratulate Senator Norris and Deputy McGuinness, who is in the in Visitors Gallery, for their work, as well as all those who have worked with them on the Bill.<\/p> <p>The important point from today's debate is that we should not allow this Bill to vanish into the ether, as I said on the Order of Business.  Notwithstanding that there are different viewpoints on the Bill, there is a need to have not just a conversation but a national conversation.  The national economic framework forum met today in Dublin Castle and the Oireachtas all-party committee met on the housing issue prior to the formation of this Seanad.  It is important that the overarching aim and spirit of the Bill are what we should all work to achieve, and that means we must abandon the high tax and spend of Sinn F&eacute;in, the fiscal prudence of Fine Gael or the catch-all of Fianna F&aacute;il in order to arrive in the middle.  This is about citizens of our country being able to be kept in their own homes, being able to buy or being able to work together to ensure we have supply of housing.<\/p> <p>In saying that, we must consider the backdrop.  I understand the sincerity of Members of the House but sometimes, when I hear Senator Ardagh talk about Fianna F&aacute;il bringing forward this or doing that, I have to wonder whether I am in a dream, because it was the party in government that nearly bankrupted the country.  I am sure if T.R. Dallas wrote a few more songs, they would be bestsellers.  We are now where we are, however, and what we must do is ensure that we achieve what Senator Norris is trying to achieve at the end of this.<\/p> <p>I do not necessarily buy the argument that we should always be looking at our debt burden, although I might not be popular in Fine Gael for saying that.  It is about people.  It is about ensuring that people can stay in their own homes and that, as Senator Norris said on the Order of Business yesterday, they are not evicted or removed.  We should not be going to the courts in this regard.  I have a viewpoint which is something similar to that of Senator Norris.  Senator O'Donnell touched on the vulture funds in his remarks.  Why can we not have some type of co-operative, as Senator Norris said, where people can go to get money and make payments?  If we look at what we are paying in rent allowance, housing assistance, hotel accommodation and the whole nine yards, I often wonder what would happen if we had some kind of vehicle whereby citizens could go and take out money and have a type of a mortgage.  We are spending a fortune on our budget for all the housing supports, which are needed and which we all support.  I am simply posing the question of whether there is a better way of doing that.<\/p> <p>Supply is the big issue.  We need to look at how we can incentivise the construction sector to provide supply in order to ensure we are doing everything possible-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#V00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>The Government is supposed to be building thousands of houses but we still have not seen them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#V00300","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Senator Murnane O'Connor------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#V00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Coveney, promised thousands and we have only 200.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#V00500","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Castles in the skies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#V00600","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>The Leader, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#V00700","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I am reminded of the line in the song \"I've looked at clouds from both sides now\".

We bailed out the banks, whether we like it or not, and they have a moral duty to work with citizens.  That might be populist but it is the reality.  All of us in this Chamber and in the other House are dealing with customers of banks, whether private or commercial.  I repeat that the banks have an obligation and a moral duty to work with all of us.  I worry that we are heading down the road of the old-type bank, where they were seen as being vastly superior to all the rest of us.  That cannot be allowed to happen.<\/p><p>This is about ensuring we have a new way of doing business.  That is why I commend Senator Norris and Deputy McGuinness on challenging the <i>status quo<\/i>and challenging the Department of Finance thinking.  Without being personal, some of the people in the Department are the people who were there in the old days.  We need to challenge that mindset because if we do not challenge each other, then we cannot find the pathway forward, irrespective of our political ideology.  I understand the Government has a different viewpoint on parts of the Bill.  That is why it is important that we do not defeat the Bill today.  We must have a national conversation.  We have a White Paper on different policy documents, whether in regard to defence or education.

To be fair to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, he said in his opening remarks as Minister, and the Taoiseach said in his first day in the D&aacute;il, that there will be a review.

If we have to tear up the whole playbook, let us not be afraid to do that.  This is about our fellow citizens.  Some of us are lucky enough to have the money to buy a house or have a mortgage, and we cannot just wash our hands and absolve ourselves of responsibility.  We are legislators.

I congratulate him on his appointment and I wish him well.  This is vitally important legislation.  It is much more important than the discussion that has taken place over the past week about judicial appointments because this matters to people in their daily lives.  This is about keeping them in their family homes and protecting their physical and mental well-being.<\/p> <p>This is one of the most important Bills to come before this Seanad because it is about protecting real people who have been disenfranchised by the financial world within the State supported by the Government of the day, whether it was the current and previous Governments or the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government which was in office prior to them.  The banks were bailed out and supported, but they have offered no support in return to those who wish to remain in their homes.  That is a disgrace on the part of our financial and political institutions.<\/p> <p>The legislation may have its flaws.  I do not recognise them but others have commented on them.  The legislation deserves respect and support.  I congratulate Senator Norris and, in particular, the chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, Deputy McGuinness, for bringing it forward.  It is radical, creative and reflects outside-the-box thinking that very often does not happen within the Civil Service.  The financial sector is not only running the political show in Ireland; it is running the political show across the world.  I did not understand this until I paid to do a masters degree in finance a few years ago.  I soon became educated in the fact that big finance is running governments across the world.  Policy decisions that are taken, whether it is in this House or the other House, or in parliaments throughout the world, are infiltrated by vested interests from the financial sector disguised as lobbyists and, therefore, those interests are always protected against the best interests of the consumer, or the home owner in this case.  The Master of the High Court and other eminent researchers have said that the repossession statistics will increase at least fivefold over the next two years.  Last year, there were approximately 5,000 repossessions and this will increase to 25,000 over the next two years if nothing is done.<\/p> <p>There has to be an alternative solution because currently banks are frustrating people to the point of breaking them and, in some cases, they are using receivers.  They are paid to do this.  Vulnerable home owners are scared out of their wits.  They are seeking medical interventions and they are forced to give up.  Eventually, their homes are repossessed through the courts and they end up on the social housing waiting list.  It will cost the State much more in the long term than the Bill would ever cost.  The legislation provides a solution that can be tweaked if needs be but it is the path to sustainable homes for many people.<\/p> <p>Receivers in the buy-to-let sector are operating on behalf of banks and vulture funds.  The banks will say the receiver is acting on behalf of the borrower but that is not the case.  I have a case where a receiver was appointed and sold two properties for a total of &euro;127,000 but only &euro;62,000 was allowed against the loans.  The receiver, therefore, took more than half the money raised.  The State is permitting banks and receivers regulated by the Central Bank to operate in this fashion while the borrower has no protection.  That is unacceptable in a democratic society.<\/p> <p>We have to stand up to big finance because it is laughing at us at the moment.  The Bill is a step in the direction of taking them on properly and standing up on behalf of the ordinary man and woman who has taken out a mortgage and hit hard times, and who through on fault of his or her own, has lost a job and is unable to repay an unsustainable mortgage.  The mortgage is a joint agreement between the lender and the borrower and that does not apply when the bank calls in the loan because the banks are taking no share of the loss.  They say they may be doing underhand deals but there is not much evidence of that.<\/p> <p>With regard to the fund that is to be established, the EU has an obligation to assist the State to deal with this residual issue because the ECB put such pressure on Ireland in 2008 and 2009.  This makes economic sense and there are many ways to justify it economically but I do not have time to go into that.  In the long term, this would be cost effective for the people affected and for the State.  It would provide value for money and keep people in their homes.  Reference was made to the need to provide additional housing.  If the Bill is not accepted, there will be a need to do so for those who are in houses with unsustainable mortgages.<\/p> <p>There are many ways of looking at this.  If these issues are not dealt with, our mental health budget will have to be increased because people are at breaking point.  I have visited families who were so distraught that they were unable to explain their circumstances.  How can they take on the might of these financial institutions?  When they seek legal advice, that is costly and they may not have the money to pursue it.  There are many caveats.  The Bill is sensible and I wish it well.  I am happy to support it and I commend Senator Norris, Deputy McGuinness and the representative groups on the work they have put in.  They are bringing forward a creative solution using outside-the-box thinking, which is urgently required.  Approximately 10% of the 760,000 mortgages in the State are in arrears of 90 days or more.  When one drills down into that number, &euro;8 billion worth is in arrears of 360 days or more.  This serious issue is coming down the tracks and if it is not dealt with now, there will be an avalanche of destruction over the next 24 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#W00300","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I call the Minister of State.

The Government cannot support the Bill because, if brought into law, the Bill as drafted raises very serious concerns from a number of perspectives, including housing policy.  The Bill could lead to the State housing budget being reallocated from social and affordable housing to the blanket purchase of mortgages in arrears for the benefit of individual mortgage holders.<\/p> <p>In terms of fiscal implications, the Bill could lead to reductions in spending and other Government priorities in order to fund the proposal.  It could also lead to a breach in the State's fiscal targets., the meeting of which have allowed the State to return to economic and employment growth.  In terms of fiscal stability, the Bill, as drafted, would incentivise an increase in mortgage arrears, given the ability to transfer costs from individual borrowers to a State backed scheme, with no impact for the individual borrower.  This would follow an impressive 15 consecutive quarters of decreases in the levels of mortgage arrears and would also be likely to undermine wider payment discipline, with consequent costs in terms of higher interest rates for the majority of holders who are paying their mortgages.  In addition, there are no substantive details provided for this proposal and no worked up business case.  Based on the information provided, it is virtually impossible to see how a large mortgage book of non-performing loans can be turned into a performing security eligible for low-cost funding without a massive capital injection.  <\/p> <p>There is no evidence that the proposed national housing co-operative society could issue bonds.  The establishment of a co-operative would require significant levels of capital and there is no information contained within the proposal about where this capital would be found.  The level of capital required to acquire &euro;13.9 billion of outstanding non-performing loans would be significant and it is not possible to see how the State could provide this capital without breaching fiscal rules.  There is also no evidence that the co-operative could be kept off balance sheet.  Furthermore, the Bill raises state aid and competition issues, and could prompt the European Commission to open an excessive deficit procedure against Ireland at a time when we have repaired the damage to Ireland's reputation at EU level and globally.<\/p> <p>The Bill states; \"The availability of EIB funding at historically low interest rates for bodies providing housing and the potential to refinance housing debt from this source\" as justification for the Bill.  There are serious difficulties with this approach, including the fact that European Investment Bank, EIB, will only lend to viable business proposals and there is no basis for how this proposal is viable.  It is difficult to see how the viability of this proposal could be established when a business case is reliant on borrowers with poor credit records making regular payments.  Even if viability could be established, any funder, be it the EIB or a third party, would likely require a significant risk premium to fund this project.  Therefore, no cost funding cannot be assumed.  The EIB will only provide half of the funding for any project, so the private sector would have to provide at least the other half of the required funding.  For the reasons outlined already, any third-party fund will charge a significant risk premium for this proposal.  Furthermore, the explanatory memorandum displays no understanding of how the ECB operates as it suggests that the co-op would, through a secured property bond, raise the total needed from the ECB and EIB with a combination of 15 and 20-year fixed interest rates.  <\/p> <p>The ECB cannot directly fund this proposal.  It could only purchase such a bond in the secondary market if it was properly marketable, rated and met all of the required conditions.  However, it is highly unlikely to be able to do so as the co-op would have to be off balance sheet.  The bond would have to be bought by the private sector and would have to be performing, none of which would appear possible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will touch on the Government's response on mortgage arrears.  Members will be aware that the Government has already introduced the mortgage-to-rent scheme which enables borrowers unable to restructure their mortgage to remain living in their home as a social housing tenant.  My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community an Local Government, recently adjusted this scheme to make it more flexible and accessible to a greater number of borrowers.  It is also the case that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Housing Agency are initiating pilot projects to explore potential mechanisms that would facilitate investment into the residential market by private equity firms using the mortgage-to-rent model.  Should these pilot projects prove successful the refined MTR model would eliminate the need for a national co-operative society proposed in this Bill.<\/p><p>The Government has also introduced personal insolvency legislation to provide a framework to allow indebted borrowers to restructure their debt in a sustainable way by means of a personal insolvency arrangement with priority being given to the objective of facilitating the borrower to remain in the principal dwelling where possible.  This legislation was further amended to introduce a court review of PIAs which included the family home which had been rejected by the lender.  The court now has the power to impose the PIA on the lender if it forms a view that the proposal is the most reasonable and best alternative to bankruptcy.  The insolvency service reports that the level of applications for PIAs has increased since the introduction of this court review. <\/p><p>Part 3 of the personal insolvency legislation is currently the subject of a review for which the public consultation phase will close on 30 June.  The outcome of this review will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.  The term for this charge of bankruptcy has been reduced from 12 years originally to three years, and last year was reduced to one year for applicants who fully co-operate with the process, allowing people to start again in a reasonable timeframe.  <\/p><p>Last October the T&aacute;naiste and then Minister for Justice and Equality, and the Minister for Social Protection launched a new Abhaile home mortgage arrears resolution service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#X02400","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":200,"content":"<p>The Minster of State has two minutes left. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#Y00150","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Abhaile facilitates State-funded access to legal advice and-or consultation with a personal insolvency practitioner for indebted borrowers to ensure that they are fully informed about all available options to address their mortgage debt.

The Act introduces a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called the credit servicing firm.  These firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law which is applied to regulated finance service providers.  Importantly, this remit ensures relevant provided borrowers whose loans are sold to third parties maintain the same regulatory protections as prior to the sale.  These protections include protections under the various statutory codes and regulations issued by the Central Bank of Ireland.

Members will see from the range of initiatives to address mortgage arrears already implemented, that the Government is already committed to providing support for borrowers in mortgage arrears and will continue to address outstanding commitments contained in the programme for partnership and the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  <\/p> <p>On 8 June, the Central Bank stated that there were 735,000 primary dwelling home mortgages outstanding at the end of the first quarter of 2017.  Some 90% of these accounts are not in arrears.  The majority of mature categories of arrears, including those in long term arrears, are now declining.  There has been a reduction of 46% in the number of primary dwelling homes accounts over 90 days in arrears since the peak of the third quarter 2013.  This cohort stands at 53,100 accounts.  The equivalent reduction in buy-to-let properties in arrears over 90 days is almost 36%.  Accounts in arrears over 730 days now number almost 33,000, with outstanding balances over &euro;7.4 billion.  <\/p> <p>These figures indicate that where borrowers actively engage with their lender under the CCMA, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and the borrowers will be able to remain in their family home which is everybody's objective.  I believe the introduction of the National Housing Co-operative Bill could undermine that good work to date by encouraging indebted mortgage holders eligible for a mortgage restructuring arrangement to wait and see how this legislation pans out.  This would be a negative outcome and mortgage arrears would continue to increase, leaving them with a larger debt to resolve in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#Y00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Could the Minister of State conclude please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#Y00500","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>This Bill would have an adverse impact on the ability to undertake secured lending in Ireland which is ultimately dependent on the financial institutions' right to realise the security if needed, and priced accordingly.

We have heard many different contributions today.  Generally people have said that they agree in principle that there is a major crisis and people have to be helped and so on.  It becomes a little tiresome, especially from the Minister of State and the Government Senators, when they give us those types of sentiments and then the Minister turns around and gives us a litany of excuses as to why these people cannot be helped rather than coming in here in a constructive way to say that he agrees with the Bill and while there are issues with it, let us work together and see how they can be improved, and giving his own suggestions.<\/p> <p>There were very few suggestions from the Minister of State on how to improve this Bill which is very disappointing at a time when we realise there is such a crisis.  If we have the wherewithal in the Department of Finance to devise the animal that is NAMA, that can organise a fire sale of bargain basement proportions for vulture funds to come in and buy up properties in the State, surely we have the wherewithal and expertise to improve Senator Norris's Bill to create what would be a more humane type of institution that would help people in mortgage distress and would really follow the spirit of this Bill.  I do not believe that the Minister of State cannot come with more positive proposals at this stage.  <\/p> <p>When people come to write the history books in years to come, Rebuilding Ireland, which the Leader mentioned earlier, will probably go down as one of the greatest works of fiction of the 21st century.  We can look at the situation in Galway at the moment.  In 2016, the previous Minister, Deputy Coveney, who has been lauded as having done great work in this area, told us that there was a target of 1,126 social housing units which were supposed to be built in Galway city and county in 2017.  How many have we got?  Fourteen.  How many will we get next year?  Fifty five, according to the targets.  That is in Galway city and county where we have over 4,000 people on social housing lists.<\/p> <p>Senators tell us that it is a supply issue which of course it is.  However, the problem with a supply issue is that the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, and previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments, have all left the supply to the private sector.  We need State intervention.  We need a State building programme that will build social and affordable houses for people who need them and take the pressure off the private rented market which will see the exorbitant rents being charged for private rented accommodation brought down.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If we build social and affordable houses for people who need them, it will take the pressure off the private rented market, the exorbitant rents that are being charged to people in private rented accommodation will decrease and it will stop the practice of people being housed in hotels and paid for by the local authorities.  There is a supply issue and the Government is not taking any real action to address it.<\/p><p>I agree with the Leader's comment earlier that a considerable amount of money is being spent on HAP, rent supplement and so on.  Approximately &euro;870,000 is being spent over a six month timeframe by Galway City Council to house 24 families in emergency accommodation.  What level of mortgage would that support?  Why can that money not be spent on construction of social and affordable housing rather than be squandered in that way?  That cannot be done because of Government policy, not only of this Government but of previous Governments.  Sinn F&eacute;in has brought forward legislation in this area.  For example, we have called for the 15 derelict sites in Galway to be bought by the local authorities for the purpose of social and affordable housing provision.  That would take some of the pressure off the supply side.<\/p><p>It is important consideration is given to the intervention suggested by Senator Norris to address of the mortgage crisis.  I have been in the repossessions court in Galway and have seen the stress people are under and the David and Goliath struggles that are going on in the courts.  In fairness, some of the county registrars are standing up to the banks.  Many people are severely stressed as a result of having to attend repossession hearings in the courts for months on end.  The banks have no problem bringing in solicitors and barristers and paying them huge amounts of money but most of the people in mortgage arrears do not have two pennies to rub together.  They cannot afford that type of support.  In Galway, the repossessions court is no bigger than a shoe box such that most of the people against whom repossession cases have been taken cannot get into the room to listen to their cases being dealt with.  It is a disgrace.<\/p><p>That Fianna F&aacute;il is rubbing its hands about this crisis is appalling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#Y01100","speaker":"1377","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":212,"content":"<p>It would be more in line for Sinn F&eacute;in to focus on fixing the problems in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#Z00200","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh to continue without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#Z00300","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il has no credibility on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#Z00400","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in has enough on its plate up North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#Z00500","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in is the most noteworthy party in this country.

What Ireland and the rest of the developed world needs to recognise is the contradiction in our energy policies.  On the one hand, we are signing up to international agreements to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while, on the other, signing oil, gas and coal exploration licences.  In the Paris Agreement we have agreed that we must limit increases in the global temperature to between 1.5&deg; and 2&deg; Celsius.  Anything more than this would cause huge disruption to our way of life that would be beyond the capacity of politics, society and technology to deal with.  However, we also know that, were they to be  burned, the current known reserves of fossil fuels would release such an amount of greenhouse gases that it would lead to further rises in temperature.  If we were to burn more, we would see further rises in temperature, exceeding the limit of between 1.5&deg; and 2&deg; Celsius.  Therefore, our current energy policy is nothing less than a complete contradiction, a policy that can only lead to one conclusion: we should keep the petroleum in the ground.  Of the known remaining reserves of oil and gas, we can burn between one third and two fifths and still keep within the 2&deg; Celsius range.  I ask the House to think about this and what it means.  It means that three fifths of the known reserves of oil, gas and coal which were located using expensive and damaging exploration techniques will just have to stay where they are: locked up and unused forever.  Any other outcome would mean disaster, not just for human society but for all life on earth.  We need to get real.  Anyone who votes against my amendment will need to explain to me how exactly he or she plans to square the circle.  Will he or she suggest exploring and then leaving the fuel in the ground or will he or she ignore the global problem and our European, global and ethical obligations to get the fuel to be burned and damn the consequences?<\/p> <p>The amendment has been taken from US Senator Bernie Sanders' just transition strategy which has been designed to ensure state action on climate change and energy policy is equal to the scale of the problem that faces us globally.  The just transition strategy is also focused on providing a pathway to a new future of work that will move people from destructive industries and help them to retrain and adapt to a new, greener future in sectors such as renewables and green technologies.  This is the approach the Green Party is emulating in Ireland and the amendment is an important demonstration of that thinking.  We have an example of such joined-up thinking in the global divestment movement that has seen the divestment of over $5 trillion dollars worth of stocks and shares in fossil fuel related companies because of academics and public and private bodies in reaction not only to the moral obligations surrounding climate change but also the fact that these companies are about to be left with a mountain of stranded assets of explored and unextractable oil, gas and coal that will be the ruin of many of them unless they get out.  I urge them to get out now.<\/p> <p>Many will say this is impractical and that we cannot endanger our energy security and that we not be able to keep the lights on without new oil and gas exploration at home.  However, just this week, the new French Government led by Emmanuel Macron has announced that it will do exactly what is proposed in the amendment.  The new Environment Minister, the noted ecologist Nicolas Hulot, declared a new law to prohibit the issuing of all new licences for oil and gas exploration, onshore and offshore, on the principle that fossil fuels located could never be extracted and that to do so would greatly endanger the lives and safety of future generations.  Before Members have a go at me about this being possible in France because of its use of nuclear power, the same government has announced the phase-out of 20 ageing and expensive atomic power plants.  The exploration ban, the nuclear power plant phase-out and the proposed ending of all fracking in France are part of a new green shift that will see France emulate Germany, Denmark, Sweden and other countries in a rapid transition to a renewables future.  I say: \"Ireland, let us get on board.\"<\/p> <p>I stress again my complete support for the Bill.  My amendment is offered not in an effort to disrupt or slow down the process but to open the debate on energy policy in Ireland that will bring it to a level that really reflects the seriousness of our commitments.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am delighted that once the President signs the Bill, which will be passed here today, fracking in Ireland will be banned, and we will have secured crucial protections for our air, water, farms, rivers, climate and, most of all, our people.<\/p><p>We have protected our community from the dangers and fears inherent in this technology, and vindicated the work of many groups here today in the Gallery, including Friends of the Earth, Afri and Love Leitrim.

As Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson for communications, climate change and natural resources, I must tell Senator O'Sullivan that unfortunately we cannot support the amendment for the simple reason that it would not keep with the Bill and could delay it being enacted.  To be consistent, in February 2011 onshore petroleum licence options for the north-west area were granted by the then Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  However, exploration drilling, including drilling that would involve hydraulic fracturing, was not allowed under these licence options.  This is backed up by replies to parliamentary questions, which I am happy to share with interested parties.  Enormous work has been done on the Love Leitrim campaign over six years by all of the councillors and Oireachtas Members, and I welcome Councillor Mary Bohan who is in the Gallery.  I also welcome Scott Coombs and Eddie Mitchell, Shane Coghlan of Friends of the Earth and many more, including representatives of Roscommon County Council and Leitrim County Council.  This issue is included in the county development plan.<\/p> <p>I commend the intelligence of getting a Government Deputy to sponsor a Private Members' Bill.  I have been endeavouring to get a Bill through for some time, the Registration of Wills Bill, and every time I get so far, I am thwarted again by a change of either Government or Minister and it is practically impossible.  Deputy Tony McLoughlin, a Fine Gael Deputy for Sligo-Leitrim, has tabled the Bill, with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government.  The Government's input was vital in this regard.  If the Government wanted to block the Bill, it could easily have done so, but it has given much consideration to the Bill.<\/p> <p>I appeal to Senator O'Sullivan to withdraw the amendment because she is going down a very dangerous path.  There is no question of fracking being allowed offshore.  It is a myth at this stage.  There are no applications and nothing on the horizon.  It is a different process.  The onshore process is well tried and well practised.  Nobody is closer to this than Councillor Bohan, because it started in her area and could have done damage to the River Shannon, tourism and the agricultural industry.  It could have destroyed the clean air and clean water.   Water is absolutely vital and there is no guarantee the water would not come down the River Shannon and pollute it, destroying fisheries and tourism.  It was the most outrageous proposal on a small island.  Fracking has happened in the United States of America and Britain.  Fracking in the United Kingdom has resulted in mini earthquakes in areas, and this fact is well recorded, because it is such a small country compared to the vast areas of the United States of America.<\/p> <p>We appreciate what the Senator is trying to do, and we sympathise with her situation, but I have been advised by the Fianna F&aacute;il research office, which is well acquainted with this issue, that this would delay implementation of the Bill.  If the amendment were accepted today, the Bill would have to go back to the D&aacute;il and go through the entire process again.  We would then have the adjournment for the summer recess and it would not be law before autumn.  I reiterate that we support the Bill 100%.  We would like to have introduced such a Bill ourselves, and we would have liked if a colleague such as Deputy Eamon Scanlon could have introduced it, but there was no point because the Government probably would not have gone along with it.<\/p> <p>It is in a good area electorally for Roscommon and Leitrim.

If a person was not 100% in one box, he or she had to be in the other box.  I agree with every word in the amendment, without reservation, but his amendment deals with offshore exploration and extending the ban to conventional gas and oil extraction, and it is not what the Bill intends.  I also recognise the absolute urgency for communities around what needs to be done to prevent fracking.  I am frightened of my life of fracking and the possibility that fracking could be allowed onshore.  This in no way diminishes how I feel about anything done offshore.  We have often cited the true map of Ireland and our offshore exploration.<\/p><p>With regard to an outright ban on all exploration, the banning of conventional offshore gas and oil exploration was not the intention of this Bill and nor does it seem to be the immediate concern for all those people involved with the community groups across Leitrim, Sligo, Clare and Mayo.  They, like me, are all fearful of the awful consequences that fracking could have on the environment and health.  We should remember that once fracking starts, there is no end.  Once there is a foothold, it will be impossible to get those companies out.  The offshore environment is very different when it comes to exploration.  The intention of the amendment is that Ireland would never use any oil or gas found off its shores, as other countries have done, such as in Norway, where the state has seen benefit from it.  We would always have advocated the Norwegian model and how the Norwegian Government stood up to oil and gas exploration methods.  We were ignored right through a decade and beyond.<\/p><p>Our aim should be to phase out fossil fuels and create a greener and more self-sufficient island when it comes to energy.  We must be realistic.  The timeframe is relatively long, considering the technology available.  What storage technology is there for renewable energy, for example?  We hope that technology will advance.  We need a realistic timeframe for the phasing out of fossil fuels and mapping of the alternatives.  This should be our priority.  I desperately want to see this Bill going through so we can deal with onshore fracking.  I would absolutely support what is being said in the amendment today at another stage when we seriously consider offshore drilling and everything else, including deals being done and the protection of our environment and citizens.  I cannot support the amendment today but I look forward to seeing it on the table in future so we can deal with it in another context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#DD01600","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I welcome all the members of Love Leitrim, Friends of the Earth, the Good Energies Alliance Ireland and all the people who put serious work into an issue about which they were very fearful.  People power set this train in motion.  I thank Deputy Tony McLoughlin for all the work done by him and his staff.  People speak about new politics and it is a good news story that a Bill could be introduced early last June and a year later it has gone through all Stages in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I look forward to this Bill being brought to the President of Ireland in the coming days for him to sign.  It is real and good politics, with people from all sides of the political divide coming together and doing something that is right and proper.<\/p> <p>I remember four or five years ago we introduced the visitors to the then Minister, former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and he would have given them a fair hearing to outline fears about pollution risks to water and the atmosphere and the contribution to climate change.  This Bill ensures the prohibition of any exploration or extraction of petroleum from rock that requires additional processes to increase the permeability of the rock and aid the extraction of petroleum from lithologies, shale rock, tight sands and coal seams.  I went to an open forum where the film from the United States was shown and I was horrified to see people lighting water where fracking caused awful consequences.  There is fluid or waste in the extraction process and the Bill would deal with such matters.  This Bill will ensure fracking will not occur in lovely Leitrim, Cavan, Fermanagh and Sligo.  I congratulate everybody who has been involved and this is a good news story for politics and the people of the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#EE00200","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber and I acknowledge the presence of Deputy Tony McLoughlin, who pioneered this Bill.  Great credit must go to him for pushing this Private Members' Bill so far.  It is great to see we are on the verge of passing this legislation.  As Senators have said, we hope it will go to the President imminently so it can be made into law.<\/p> <p>As representatives of the Government we will not support the amendment.  The debate needs to happen but today is about fracking and how we can ensure this particular matter can be dealt with.  Deputy McLoughlin set out an agenda and has delivered so far on it.  If we brought this into the debate, it would slow the process, although the House should have the debate at some stage.  Senator Grace O'Sullivan is capable and an excellent Senator but we should have a debate with the Minister on future fuel needs and how we will legislate for them.  It is a broader debate that will involve solar farms and guidelines, wind farms and electric cars.  A variety of topics must be dealt with.  We need to have the Minister in the House for a considerable period to thrash out the issues so we can move ahead with appropriate legislation for our country.  It is a key matter for us as a nation.  Unless we act now, it will be too late.  Senator O'Sullivan has great knowledge in the field and we must try to work with everyone in the House to ensure there is appropriate legislation for everyone.<\/p> <p>As I stated, this Bill is about fracking and an initiative brought forward by Deputy McLoughlin.  I hope that today we can bring it forward and have it passed.  I hope the Bill will move swiftly through the House in the next hour and I hope it can be enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#EE00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1498642200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend Deputy Tony McLoughlin, who demonstrated an extraordinary positive initiative in bringing forward this Bill and building cross-party support.  A positive aspect of new politics that we have seen is not just that quality proposals coming from the Opposition benches are more often beginning to be considered - we have some positive Opposition legislation moving through the House and becoming law - but also that some backbenchers within the Government have done the same.  Senator Colm Burke in this House has put forward very constructive proposals for legislation.  I commend the Deputy and it is important those proposals are being heard.<\/p> <p>Others have mentioned Love Leitrim and Friends of the Earth.  Afri, or Action From Ireland, has done extraordinary work.  I also give credit to the wider movement that is asking the important questions around fossil fuels.  We have seen movements for divestment from fossil fuels from the likes of Tr&oacute;caire, Trinity College Dublin and National University of Ireland, Galway.  We have seen a lead from many young people who understand that fossil fuels cannot be at the core of a future for them or any of us on this shared planet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017062800002#EE00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498642200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
