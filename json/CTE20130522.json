The End Child Poverty Coalition is a coalition of eight organisations.  We have copies of our submission for members.<\/p><p>  We have been working for some time on various measures to try to eradicate the scourge of child poverty in this country.  Our perspective on the reforms is that we are very much pro-reform.  We have been advocating for reform for a number of years, and we have been advocating for much more progressive reform than has been implemented.  We have put on the record on numerous occasions our opposition to flat-rate cuts in child benefit, which are highly regressive in nature.  We note that in recent years nearly &euro;500 million has been taken from child income supports.  Cumulatively, when we examine the impact of child benefit cuts, smaller families have suffered a cut of more than a fifth in their child benefit payments and larger families have suffered a cut of one third in child benefit payments.<\/p><p>  Probably with the exception of young people who are unemployed, no other group in society has been asked to carry as heavy a burden of adjustment as this country&rsquo;s children.  The cuts have gone far enough and we cannot sustain any further flat-rate cuts to child benefit.  We are broadly in favour of reform.  We have advocated for a two-tier structure of child income support for a number of years.  However, we offer that support with a number of very important caveats, the first of which relates to low-income working families.  They are currently eligible for family income supplement, FIS, a vital support within the social protection system to ensure that work does indeed pay and that it is capable of providing a route out of poverty for low-income families.  Every single report in recent years &ndash; they go back more than 20 years &ndash; which has examined a two-tier type structure for child income support has always identified that a residual FIS-type scheme would be required, as a two-tier payment cannot be a simple replacement for something like family income support because it plays a very specific role in the social protection system.  We are deeply concerned that the Mangan report proposes to replace one of the child income supports with the second-tier payment.  That would mean a number of families that are in receipt of family income supplement, for whom it is an even more vital supplement now than it ever was, would face losses five to six times higher than families at the very top end of the income distribution.  It is a fundamental structural adjustment to the social protection system which reduces the incentive to participate in paid employment and would undoubtedly reinforce child poverty and trap families who are unemployed.<\/p><p>  The ESRI considered the impact of securing higher take-up rates on FIS and the impact that would have on child poverty.  Its estimate a number of years ago was that it would secure a 3% reduction in child poverty rates.  The Mangan report, by comparison, achieves a reduction of 0.2% in poverty.  There are much more efficient ways we can go about doing this.  We believe that if a second-tier payment is to be introduced it is critically important that FIS is retained within the system until a better in-work benefit has been identified.  We cannot get rid of FIS until a better alternative is in place.<\/p><p>  We are also concerned about the withdrawal cut-off point that was identified in the Mangan report, which is as low as &euro;25,000.  We had an opportunity to meet with the Minister for Social Protection yesterday and she indicated to us that the Mangan report has been asked to examine different cut-off points.  We take some hope from that because we feel the cut-off point is far too low and will result in hardship for a number of families on low incomes.<\/p><p>  The final point we wish to make is about investment in child services.  We know from work internationally and in this country that if we really want to achieve a meaningful impact on child poverty that it is investment in services for children that is likely to achieve the best results.  We look, for example, to initiatives such as the free preschool year for children as being progressive measures in terms of achieving much better child welfare outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052200003#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Camille Loftus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369224600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Orla O'Connor to make her remarks on behalf of the National Women's Council of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052200004#H00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369224600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting the National Women's Council to come before it.  We are the leading national women's membership organisation in Ireland and we represent over 165 member groups from a diversity of backgrounds, sectors and locations throughout the country.<\/p><p>  For families, particularly women and children, child income supports, and particularly child benefit, are critical.  We know that child benefit clearly recognises the role played by women as care givers and that income may not be distributed equally within the home.  Research has shown that the vast majority of child benefit is spent either directly on children or indirectly in terms of household bills and supports.  <\/p><p>  In the Irish context, because of the lack of investment in child care, child benefit is seen as a key mechanism in supporting costs around child care.  When the Government introduced a series of increases in child benefit it stated that it was about recognising child care costs.<\/p><p>  Through successive budgets we have seen a reduced level of child benefit.  The National Women's Council estimates that families with four children have already seen a cumulative loss of over &euro;2,600 per annum.  While some compensatory payments have been made in terms of dependent children, that is not extended to the vast majority of families.<\/p><p>  We welcome the unanimity in the advisory group's report on tax and welfare in terms of its view that there should be a continued role for universality within the system of child income support.  That is critical, but we are concerned about the ratio indicated in the report between a universal payment and a targeted payment.  <\/p><p>  While it is acknowledged that families on very low incomes may be compensated for any reductions to the universal element of the payment, it is the experience of the National Women's Council and our members that families on low and middle incomes are struggling to pay for essential household items.  We are aware it is the only support in terms of paying for the costs of child care.  We believe that any further reduction to the current levels of child benefit are unsustainable for the majority of families.<\/p><p>  With regard to the thresholds recommended in the report, it is recommended that the second-tier payment would be withdrawn when gross income reaches &euro;25,000.<b><\/b> That is too low, particularly in terms of the needs of many women on low pay or reduced working hours.<\/p><p>  Assessing gross income is also problematic as it does not take into account families' levels of expenditure commitments.  For example, income could be assessed where expenditure such as accommodation costs, child care costs and health care costs for children might be excluded.<\/p><p>  Regarding family income supplement, we are at one with the anti-poverty coalition in that we believe it is critical that an in-work support is maintained within the system.  We are concerned about the recommendations in the report in that regard.<\/p><p>  With regard to reducing levels of child income supports and trading off with services, from a National Women's Council perspective it is critical that services are put in place for children, particularly in terms of child care and also health care services.  We have reached a point in this country as a result of austerity where it is not possible for families to sustain further cuts, and we must see those investments in services being made before any further cuts are considered.<\/p><p>  In terms of the National Women's Council's recommendations on the report, the current levels of the universal payment must be maintained.  We do not agree with the ratios suggested in the report.  The entrance level at which families become eligible for the second-tier payment must be significantly higher than the &euro;25,000 suggested.  The exit levels or cut-off points must be higher.  It is critical that an in-work support is maintained and clearly linked to employment rather than child supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052200004#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1369224600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as ucht an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite acu.  I met representatives of the End Child Poverty Coalition last week and therefore I have had a discussion on this topic already.  A number of questions arise in this regard but also with regard to some of the pronouncements on child benefit in the past week in particular.  I am one of those who believes in the universality of child benefit.  The argument that we can have a universal child payment and a second-tier payment is a dangerous road to go down because the same argument can be used for the universality of the free preschool education place, a second year of free preschool education, free schooling or anything else.  What are the witnesses' views on that?  The National Women's Council might prefer that if there is to be a change, at the very least it would happen at a different ratio but I would be concerned if we go down that road.<\/p><p>  I will not dwell on Labour Party election promises - we have had that debate - but last week the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, stated that the money from a further cut in child benefit could be used to invest in a second year of free preschool education.  In the following days, however, the T&aacute;naiste stated there would be no further changes to child benefit.  Have the witnesses any indication of what is happening in that regard?  They stated that they met the Minister for Social Protection and if she is suggesting that committee should further examine the Mangan report, that suggests the T&aacute;naiste is out of step with either the Minister, Deputy Burton, or the Minister for Education and Skills.  We do not know where we are on that.<\/p><p>  On the &euro;450 million the witnesses stated has been taken out of child supports to date, do they agree that that &euro;450 million has not been reinvested in child services, which would be contrary to what the Minister, Deputy Quinn, suggested?  He may have been talking about doing that in the future but the existing &euro;450 million cut in recent years has not improved services.  Currently, social welfare payments are viewed as a social transfer and it has been shown that social transfers work in terms of dealing with poverty, especially child poverty.  Is investment in preschool places regarded as a social transfer or an investment in education?  Can they be grouped together?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052200004#H00400","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1369224600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.

As for the recommended threshold of &euro;25,000, when Ita Mangan appeared before the joint committee to present her report she went to great lengths to state this was not a recommendation but was simply an example drawn up by the report's authors.  As a committee, members told her that because it was the only example given, it tends to be perceived as the recommendation.

Deputy Ryan has asked one or two of the questions I had intended to ask, as to what were the witnesses' proposals for reform.  As the witnesses are aware, the Mangan report drew on contributions from many organisations.  Did they feed their proposals to the team that drew up the report?  I have my doubts about universality of payments.  For example, without identifying the person concerned, I spoke to someone only last night who recounted an earlier conversation with a chief executive officer of a company who is on big money.  Last year, when &euro;10 was cut from child benefit, he went berserk giving out about it, even though he earns a huge amount of money.  A point members discuss every day in respect of every Department is that many people are being paid what sometimes are immoral amounts of money but they also have an entitlement to child benefit.  My worry is that people who merely are PAYE workers on low to moderate incomes discern that such people still have the same entitlement to child benefit as they themselves enjoy.  It is very hard to understand the reason this is allowed to happen.  As for the &euro;25,000 threshold, that simply was an indicative figure used to state that were one below it, one would be in poverty.  However, to be honest, one would want to be earning considerably more than that to be out of poverty these days.  The sum of &euro;25,000 is very low and I am sure it will not be the figure used because it is too low.<\/p><p>  During a debate on this issue in the Seanad, the Minister for Social Protection stated she would not make further cuts to child benefit until proper child care was in place. I hope she will honour this commitment and this is the reason the T&aacute;naiste has stated there will not be changes.  I will take up this matter with the Minister again to be sure she will honour that commitment.  As everyone is aware, education probably is the best investment one can give a child but as Senator Healy Eames noted, although the preschool year will benefit families with younger children, it will not be of any benefit to children aged five and upwards who are going to school and so on.  If their money is to be cut, it will be seen to be subsidising people with younger children but families with older children need the money for school expenses and so on.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance and members have noted and will take on board their comments.  I apologise for being obliged to leave during the presentations but members have the full transcripts to hand and will give them due consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052200005#J00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1369225200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>In a reversal of the order of speaking, I invite Ms Orla O'Connor to respond first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052200005#J00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369225200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>If it is okay, Ms Ann Irwin will make a start on some of those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052200005#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369225200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>On the family income supplement payment, Senator Healy Eames is correct that work should pay.

It could pertain to their rates of pay or it could be that for different reasons, they are engaged in part-time work.  This could be a choice they have made or could be because their hours have been reduced.  While there is a myriad of reasons, there is a large number of people for whom work does not pay an acceptable rate and this is the reason the State has an in-work payment, such as FIS.  Our concern pertains to breaking the relationship between the FIS and work.  Consequently, if the FIS payment is to be replaced by this selective second-tier payment, it means this relationship between work and the payment is broken.  We think this is highly problematic because if one looks at all the statistics and all the reports, including the most recent one from the ESRI on jobless households, they tell one the best way to get and keep people out of poverty is to have them maintain employment.  Essentially, this is what the FIS does.  It helps people to maintain employment, even when it is not bringing in a huge financial gain and for the National Women's Council of Ireland, to break that relationship is highly problematic.  Many people might ask for what they were working if they would receive the same level of child benefit in any event, even if they were not working.  Consequently, the maintenance of the relationship between work and the in work payment is vital.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Ryan's point on cut-off points, he is right.  It has emerged since the report was published that these figures were indicative and are only given as suggestions.  I am aware that Ita Mangan is working on different scenarios and we are glad to hear that because we fully agree that &euro;25,000 is a low level at which people would become eligible for the cut-off of payment.  In addition, the withdrawal of payment, once one goes above a certain threshold, is problematic for us because women, for example, on hourly rates from time to time, may be offered additional hours, which would mean additional income.  Consequently, they may lose child benefit as a result of taking up additional hours of work.  However, those additional hours may well be temporary and consequently, there are all kinds of reasons, in terms of our work on women and economic independence and of maintaining women in employment, when that is their choice or perhaps not even a choice.  In terms of our work in that area, it is vital that women are supported to work and that nothing disincentivises women from holding onto work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052200005#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Irwin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369225800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I want to respond to the other question asked by Deputy Ryan and Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  It was the issue of investment in services.  To be clear, the National Women's Council supports a second year of preschool.  We think that is very important.  Our position, and what is being said so often by women over the past few years, is that it cannot be introduced at the expense of child benefit.  On the conversation that took place in the women's council, we were in a different place about eight years ago and people were looking at, if the Government made a reduction, what else might happen, particularly around medical cards for children and child care.  It has completely changed.  The members of the women's council are in a completely different position in terms of saying how much women need child benefit for basic household bills.  It cannot be a trade-off now.  We are not in that scenario.<\/p><p>  On the point about high earners getting child benefit, from our perspective child benefit is important as a payment for all children and we believe that it needs to be maintained in that way.  We completely accept the argument on redistribution of wealth in Ireland.  What we have been advocating in the National Women's Council is that we need to look at other ways of doing that.  Consistently, in pre-budget submissions, we have been advocating a third rate of tax as a way of doing it, which would bring in far more revenue than looking at, for example, what we were looking at previously which was the taxation of child benefit.  There are other ways of redistributing wealth, but once one starts cutting child benefit, one will cut back on families who need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052200006#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369225800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I will address some of the more technical aspects and I might invite some of my colleagues to supplement my answer.  There are a number of overlapping themes in the questions and I will try to address them it that way.<\/p><p>  There is a question about universality, both whether it is good or bad.  From the End Child Poverty Coalition's perspective, we are strongly in support of a universal child income support.  It is critically important for the State to deliver that kind of support in respect of all children.<\/p><p>  There are questions about distribution.  It is one of the reasons we have supported a second-tier payment, which is to maintain the bedrock of universality but to deliver a higher level of support to the families which would need it most.  That is the basic theory behind it.<\/p><p>  Specifically, in answer to Senator Marie Moloney's question, if there are concerns about very high earners receiving child benefit, the simple solution to that, without getting into overall complex mechanisms, is to apply higher tax rates to very high earners.  If I were a very high earner, in the absence of having any children whatsoever, I would not consider it at all unreasonable that I should pay more tax in order to contribute to the welfare of children who did not get raised in as good a circumstance as I did.  That is a fair social trade-off.<\/p><p>  On making work pay, I strongly endorse the comments by the women's council.  Child poverty is strongly related to joblessness in Ireland, and it was so even during the so-called boom years.  There are many who are concerned about that.<\/p><p>  Senator Healy Eames asked does more welfare support make work less attractive.  The point of the family income supplement is that it addresses that specific problem.  That is why FIS is such an important payment in the system.<\/p><p>  The second-tier payment, in and of itself, does not deliver additional support to those who are in work.  It treats all income the same.  FIS states, \"If you are in work, we will deliver a higher level of support to you because it is critically important that work pays\".<\/p><p>  I would broaden out this.  If we look at the changes that have happened in social protection over the past couple of years and look at changes to both jobseeker payments and lone parent payments, in each instance those changes have reduced the return from participating in employment for those who are unemployed.  They have made the transition from welfare to work less attractive than it was in the past.  The answer from the policy system always was that FIS is there to ensure that work always pays.  The alarming aspect about these proposals is that they propose to withdraw that very support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052200006#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Camille Loftus"},{"type":"speech","time":1369225800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>It is under threat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013052200006#K00400","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369225800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>On whether there would be better in-work benefits, over half the OECD countries now use an in-work benefit.

It delivers a much more progressive system of child income support, but we always need to deliver those extra supports for low-paid families.  Much as I would like to see wages increase and much as I would like to see people have access to much more work than they do at present, there will always be households which are not capable of earning what they need to support their family's needs and, therefore, an in-work benefit is an important support.<\/p><p>  These were relatively new a number of years ago, although there are well-established systems in liberal welfare systems or Anglo-Saxon welfare systems, the United Kingdom and the United States being two of the primary examples in this regard.

One cannot increase the services and leave the payments at the same level given that there is not a great deal of money out there.

It was recognised initially in the tax system but is not now due to the issue of whether people are in the tax net and so on.

It also means the provision of quality after-school care.  While 6,000 after-school places were provided for in budget 2013, there are quality and quantity issues given that there are many thousands of children who would benefit from such a service, which would facilitate their parents to take up employment and, where such parents are in low-paid employment, maintain or become eligible for FIS payments.

Costs also include food and transport.  It is not good enough to give people the same support whether they are in work or out of it as that fails to recognise the extra costs they face.  FIS rewards work and does not merely ensure that one is no worse off if one is working.

People must be able to feel that their family will be better off as a result.<\/p><p>  It is becoming clear that with the changes to the one-parent family payment, FIS will help some of those lone parents who are in work to make the transition when their child turns seven.

I will begin by making some general comments in respect of the outputs of my Department during 2012 and to date in 2013.<\/p><p>  The year 2012 was another demanding year for both this Department and for the economy.  We continue to operate in a very demanding and fast changing economic and financial environment and staff continue to respond unstintingly to the demands placed on them.  This was very evident in both the successful conclusion of the promissory note renegotiations and the special liquidation of IBRC.  The Deputies will have seen at first hand the dedication of and contribution made by staff in the Department where the very thorough pre-planning and delicate negotiation and diplomacy brought to these complicated issues resulted in very real value to the taxpayer. The successful sale of Irish Life, Bank of Ireland contingent capital notes and the efficient management of our EU Presidency programme were also key features of a particularly busy schedule for the Department.  Delivery on these issues does not happen without the continued support, often late into the night and indeed through the night, from the staff of the Department.  There are high stakes involved and we continue to make steady progress towards achieving our strategic goals.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to report that 2012 represented another significant stage on our road to economic recovery.  Following a return to growth in 2011, Ireland achieved a second successive year of growth in 2012, with GDP, in volume terms, having recorded growth of 0.9% in the year.  As would be expected from a small open economy such as Ireland's, the exporting sectors continue to drive our economic recovery.  While product-specific developments in the pharma-chem sector have impacted on goods exports, Ireland's services exports continue to perform strongly, having increased by 8.9% in 2012.  This continued success owes much to the significant competitiveness improvements that have taken place in recent years - a reflection of the flexibility of the Irish economy.<\/p><p>  While this in itself is encouraging, perhaps of more immediate relevance to the people of Ireland have been the signs of stabilisation in the domestic economy over the past year.  For the first time since the onset of the recession, households saw an increase in their disposable income during the year, while quarter 4 saw the first annual increase in employment since mid-2008.  On foot of this, personal consumption stabilised over the second half of 2012, recording modest growth over the last two quarters.  Last year also saw investment contribute positively to growth, recording the first year-on-year increase since 2007.  While Government consumption continues to decline - reflecting the necessary fiscal rebalancing - my Department now expects domestic demand to return to growth this year.  The importance of a vibrant domestic economy cannot be understated.  Domestic activity drives employment and its recovery is a vital precondition to tackling our high unemployment levels.<\/p><p>  Ireland's public finances have gone through an exceptionally difficult period in recent times.  After a sustained period of balanced budgets, the economic downturn caused the emergence of large deficits in each of the years since 2008.  In addition, the very significant level of support the State has been required to provide to our banking sector has contributed significantly to the deterioration in our public finances and is a large part of the reason for the extremely sharp, steep increase in our debt level.  As recently as 2007, our debt-to-GDP ratio was just 25%.  This year we expect it to peak at approximately 123%, a very substantial level of increase by any standards and in such a relatively short space of time.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding this, the public finances are moving in the right direction.  Ireland has continued to demonstrate signs that the recovery is on track.  The latest figures show that our economy is growing, with GDP increasing by 0.9% in 2012.  Encouragingly, this was the second consecutive year of recorded economic growth and this positive trend is projected to continue throughout 2013.  This year's budget is based on real GDP growth of 1.3%.  Stabilising the debt ratio through a reduction in our annual deficit or borrowing requirement continues to be the backdrop that frames our fiscal policy.  The fiscal consolidation process has been under way since mid-2008 and all told, measures designed to yield or save approximately &euro;28 billion, or close to 17% of estimated 2013 GDP, have so far been implemented.<\/p><p>  However, we know that restoring our public finances to a sustainable path in the coming years cannot come from consolidation alone.  Economic growth is a key contributor and in designing economic and budgetary policy, we must be mindful of this.  Getting people back to work is at the top of this Government's agenda.  In light of this, one of the main focuses of budget 2013 was on small and medium-sized industries, SMEs.  We announced a ten point tax reform plan which included measures that will make a real difference to SMEs by assisting their cash position and supporting their creation of jobs.<\/p><p>  Turning to the labour market, 2012 saw the first real signs of stabilisation following the crisis.  Seasonally adjusted employment increased over each of the last two quarters, resulting in the first annual increase in the number of people in employment since mid-2008 in the fourth quarter.  On foot of this, it is encouraging to note that my Department is now forecasting a return to full-year employment growth for this year.  The unemployment rate meanwhile stood at 14% in April, having fallen from a peak of 15% in February 2012.  The Government remains committed to tackling the unacceptably high level of unemployment by creating an environment which supports enterprise and job creation.  Reflecting this, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 set out over 333 actions to be undertaken in the coming year to support job creation and complement measures already undertaken in the jobs initiative and the pathways to work.  The scope of the plan reflects not just the ambition of this Government but a determination to get Ireland's unemployed back to work again.<\/p><p>  However, in assessing the economic outlook for Ireland, it is important to recognise that we are in a time of heightened uncertainty and considerable risk.  Given the export-orientated nature of our economy, our fortunes are indelibly intertwined with those of our trading partners.  Ireland cannot prosper in isolation and any re-ignition of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area would clearly pose a significant threat to our recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013052200003#B00800","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369237800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I will try to be brief to allow as much time to examine the Estimates as possible.  I join the Minister in acknowledging the commitment of his staff.  They have impressed me over the course of the year with the commitment they have shown to their duties.  Many of them have gone beyond the call of duty on many occasions and I readily acknowledge that and thank them for all of their work.<\/p><p>  The Minister pointed out in his opening statement what he regards as evidence of a recovery in the economy.  There is evidence of a recovery in some sectors and I believe we should make the next budget about SMEs.  We should build on the package of measures the Minister announced in December to give SMEs even more support.  When we talk to people who are in business, they refer to the same issues again and again: rent, rates, energy costs, waste disposal, red tape and compliance.  If we can free up the entrepreneurial spirit around the country, we will secure a recovery in the domestic economy far more quickly than will otherwise be the case.<\/p><p>  The approach to date has been to rely on an export-led recovery.  Exports have been doing well generally but as the Minister acknowledged in his own contribution, the exports of goods has declined, it is now the export of services that is leading the recovery.  There is a major threat for Ireland because we export 90% of everything we produce and we need demand from our trading partners.  We returned to modest growth in 2011 and 2012 because of exports.  When we look at the economic data that continue to come out of the eurozone, they are extremely weak.  It is still in recession and many countries that should not be continuing with fiscal consolidation and that have scope to invest further in their economies are continuing blindly down the road of austerity which is hampering demand across Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013052200005#D00200","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369238400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>In the context of Deputy McGrath's comments on NAMA, I understand that the agency will be coming under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.

In terms of his assessment of the economy and where it is at, the Minister paints a relatively positive picture of the Government's success, as he would see it, in fixing the economy and preparing it for economic growth, improved employment rates and so forth.  However, I would put it to the Minister that when we look at the question of jobs, which is the priority, the balance sheet does not really look that positive.  The Government is claiming that it has delivered 92% of its commitments in the programme for Government related to the fostering employment.  With 92% of what the Government promised already delivered, in terms of various initiatives, schemes and legislation, the net impact on the chronic level of unemployment is 1%.  The unemployment rate has dropped from 15% to 14%.  That is not a success story.  Indeed, emigration probably accounts for most of that reduction.  Whatever about the arguments concerning what we have done to date, from now on we must have a much more focused plan for dealing with unemployment, to offer some hope to the hundreds of thousands of people who are without jobs.  I said in the D&aacute;il recently that I do not see why we would not have targets that are as specific for reducing unemployment as the ones the Minister and the troika have for deficit and debt reduction.  There are very specific targets set for the amount that will be taken out of the economy and how that will impact on our deficit.  Why can we not have targets which chart a course towards reducing unemployment to reasonable levels or, indeed, to as close to 0% as possible?  Should that not be a priority and a target for the Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013052200006#E00300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369239000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I am giving the Deputy latitude but we must stick to the subject of the Votes.

Our primary deficit is much smaller than the very large deficit which is regularly mentioned, most of which consists of interest payments on a massive debt the State has incurred as a result of the crash, and the unloading of the bank debt on the State to a point where if the Minister's growth projections and hopes do not materialise, it may be unsustainable.  This year we will pay out &euro;8 billion in interest on a debt most of which is not our citizens' debt.  Do we not have to deal with that because we are close to the point of taking in as much in tax revenue as we spend but we are still in this deficit position which requires further attacks on incomes and so on, with the likelihood of further damage to the economy because of a massive interest bill?<\/p><p>  I note, and the Minister noted in respect of the Estimates, that a significant sum is being paid out for consultancy advice to the Government on dealing with the banking crisis.

EU Regulation No. 26\/2012 established technical and business requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euro and entered into force on the day following its publication in the<i> Official Journal of the European Union <\/i>on 30 March 2012.  The regulation specifies an update on 1 February 2014 for the migration of all credit transfers and direct debit payment to SEPA credit transfer, SCT, and SEPA direct debit, SDD, data formats.  However, as part of the approval by the European Commission in July 2010 of the restructuring plan for the Bank of Ireland a commitment was made that the State would migrate credit transfers and direct debit payments of Departments to SEPA standards by 31 March 2013.<\/p><p>  SEPA stands for the single euro payments area standards.  The commitment was conditional on banks and software vendors being in a position to provide the necessary solutions in time.  Neither the banks nor the software providers were in a position to fully meet the accelerated SEPA deadline.  However, we will endeavour that Departments will migrate to SEPA standards as soon as their suppliers can facilitate it.  In any event, it will be in advance of the required date of 1 February 2014.  Therefore, it does not relate to staffing costs, I am informed, but to the advertising and communications costs to ensure that people are aware of their responsibilities to move across to single euro payments area standards for payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013052200009#H02300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1369240200,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I have been generous with time but I will have to tighten up a little.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013052200009#H02400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1369240200,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013052200009#H02500","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1369240200,"counter":188,"content":"<p>The old rule is that if you do not know the answer to the question, do not ask it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013052200009#H02600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1369240200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>That is the cynical take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013052200009#H02700","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1369240200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>It is the professional take.

A small number of companies pay large amounts of tax.  The current controversy is very unfair to the tax situation in Ireland.  Every company in Ireland which is liable to pay 12.5% on the profits they earn in Ireland is paying it.  It is a very tax compliant country.  Many of the profits made by multinational companies are not subject to Irish taxation, and if that is the case we cannot collect money from the parts of their profitability which are somebody else's responsibility.  That is from where the extraordinary figures arise. <\/p><p>  Apple is being talked about.  It paid 12.5% on all the profits it made in Ireland, and that is the only liability it has in Ireland.  It might pay less elsewhere.  Companies registered in the Deputy's constituency are not obliged to pay tax in Ireland because they are not registered for tax in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Today's<i> Financial Times<\/i> refers to a figure of $1.2 trillion overseas dollars from the United States which is not repatriated because the United States makes a distinction between profits generated domestically and profits generated abroad.  We are not in a position to remediate that.  Today the <i>Wall Street Journal <\/i>states:<blockquote>  The Apple units are registered in Ireland so US law does not consider them to be US corporations subject to US corporate tax.  But since they are managed and controlled by Apple in the US, Irish law does not consider them to be Irish companies and thus they are also not subject to the 12.5% Irish corporate tax.  This isn't alchemy, it's accountancy.<\/blockquote>  It supports the Irish position.  The <i>Financial Times<\/i> stated: <blockquote>  But the senators would do better to look closer to home.  An over complicated US tax code has allowed the principle of no double taxation to degenerate into one of double no taxation ... But to be fair, there is no evidence that Ireland struck preferential deals with Apple ... Much of the avoidance cited is routinely used by US multinationals thanks to a tax code which invites this through differing treatment of foreign and domestic earnings.  At the last count US companies held $1.7 trillion in remission profits.  Rather than bash companies in foreign countries, the Apple example should encourage Congress to move on corporate tax reform. <\/blockquote>Any of us who have jobs in our constituencies in companies like Apple, which employs about 4,000 people in Cork, should remember about 100,000 people are employed in US multinationals in Ireland.  We would want to be very careful that we do not join in this clack of criticism when the Irish taxation system is totally transparent. <\/p><p>  The rate of 12.5% applies to all profits from multinational companies in Ireland.  There are no arrangements made between Revenue and multinationals operating in Ireland.  Irish tax is not a matter of administrative arrangement, as are tax systems in some other European countries.  Irish tax is governed by law passed here and in the Seanad.  The Revenue Commissioners must abide by that law and must apply the law fairly and evenly, and does so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013052200011#K02400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1369241400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>A spokesperson for Apple testified to the US Senate that it paid 2% tax in Ireland and had negotiated that with the Irish Government.

It is not to do with the Irish tax code which is completely transparent.  On profits generated in Ireland and on profits liable to tax in Ireland, the 12.5% rate applies universally.

They are not liable to Irish tax - neither under Irish law nor international law.  They are not resident in Ireland because they are not managed and controlled here.

Notwithstanding this, the central point is that the committee proceeded to speak of an Irish special tax rate of 2% or less, as if the companies concerned were, in fact, Irish tax-resident, which they are not.

It states that our purpose is to help the Taoiseach and the Government to resolve the current economic crisis, implement the programme for Government and to build a fairer society and a better future for Ireland and all her citizens.  As civil servants, we are committed to providing an excellent service for the Government and the other institutions of State &ndash; which of course includes the Oireachtas &ndash; as well as for the public as citizens and users of public services.  We do that work based on the principles of integrity, impartiality, effectiveness, equity and accountability.<\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategy statement, with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s approval, sets out eight priorities for the period to 2014.  These are headed by the most important, namely, jobs and economic growth, and also include: Europe; the programme for Government; service, which is intended to capture the various services provided by the Department to the Taoiseach, the Government and the public in general; reform; trust; fairness; and peace, which would refer mainly to Northern Ireland matters.  It also sets out a number of horizontal themes, including developing our internal capacity and skills, a stronger focus on implementation, a greater emphasis on strategic thinking and forward planning, and changing the culture and rebuilding trust.<\/p><p>  The strategy statement also emphasises that the Department's role requires strong working relationships with other Departments and agencies, and with stakeholders outside the public service.  The annual report, which was approved by the Government yesterday and published, highlights the core activities of the Department during 2012.  It emphasises the work of the Cabinet committee system, which is central to our role, reflecting the Government's commitment that the Department act as a Cabinet office.  The annual report also gives an overview of developments in each of the eight strategic priority areas.  This includes the exceptional responsibilities associated with Ireland&rsquo;s current Presidency of the European Union, which continues to be a key area of work within the Department.  Whereas there is much important work to be completed, it is fair to say that Ireland is viewed as running a very effective Presidency so far.<\/p><p>  Of course, notwithstanding the wide range of work undertaken by the Department and across the Government, there are strategic priorities where we are not happy with the current position.  We should never be happy if there can be improvements, and creating jobs and economic growth is the most important issue and we remain most concerned about it.  Tackling the unemployment crisis is our first priority and it remains our biggest challenge.  Unfortunately, given the unprecedented scale of the economic crisis, there is much work to be done on this and on other fronts.<\/p><p>  I know one aspect of the Department&rsquo;s work that is of interest to the committee is the IFSC Clearing House Group.  I chair the Clearing House Group, which meets four of five times a year, and I have provided a briefing note on the work of the group and on the importance of the international financial services industry to Ireland.  As chair, I have sought to emphasise a number of issues, including: the protection and creation of jobs through the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s strategy for the industry published in 2011, if I remember correctly; transparency, notably through the publication of the minutes of the group for the first time since its establishment in 1987, as well as the publication of my diary; and the need for credible, responsible, proportionate and independent regulation, which is a very important part of how the industry must operate.  I can elaborate on any of these issues for the members of the committee.<\/p><p>  The strategy statement and annual report outline a significant amount of work undertaken across a very wide range of responsibilities by what is a relatively small organisation with fewer than 200 people by the end of the year.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the staff of the Department for all of the work and I am happy to take questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052200003#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Fraser"},{"type":"speech","time":1369227600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Mr. Fraser and his colleagues are welcome.

I presume that is a reference to Oireachtas committees.  Is the witness aware that the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privilege and Procedures) Bill, which will be debated on Second Stage this afternoon in the House, provides for at least four or five new Oireachtas committees?

It was dealing with three Ministers and six Ministers of State at the same time.  That leads to a very congested situation, particularly with the type of very welcome reforms that are now taking place in committee procedure, such as pre-legislative scrutiny.  The workload of committees has increased as part of the reform agenda, but the over-compressing of multiple portfolios into single committees was an error.  The error was adjusted because transport was removed from the environment committee six or seven months later.  We need to be mindful that reform and reduction are not necessarily the same thing.

We got into trouble here because of a lack of regulation and for that reason, transparency is very important.  That is why I wanted to see such presentations being published, particularly if they have the potential to influence regulation.  We all know the problems that a lack of regulation caused.

This is an unprecedented structured access by the biggest hitters in the financial markets system in the Europe to the highest levels of the Government, chaired by the Irish Prime Minister.  Deputy Boyd Barrett in particular and I have raised this directly with the Taoiseach on many occasions in the past two years - the people who have this unprecedented inner corridor to the very heart power in this State, include representatives from Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Citigroup, Zurich, IBEC, PricewaterhouseCoopers and so on.  In the briefing material the Department has provided, the point is made that membership of the Clearing House Group includes senior public sector and industry representatives.  There are a number of specialised working groups in the areas of banking and treasury, insurance, pension funds, asset management.  These are chaired by industry representatives who also sit on the Clearing House Group for the duration of their tenure as Chairs of the particular groups.  <\/p><p>  Let me put it to Mr. Fraser that this is the kind of inside track that lobbyists in other industries could only hallucinate about.  This is corporate government as far as the financial service, the big banks and the major financial institutions.  The irony is that the very forces whose activities crashed the financial system five years ago as a result of their unbridled speculation and profiteering are now being given the responsibility for clearing up the mess, sitting in the lap of the Government or <i>vice versa .  <\/i>Mr. Fraser cannot say anything other than these private institutions have unprecedented influence on Government policy. <\/p><p>  I am asking Mr. Fraser making a note of one or two of these points because I have limited time and he can reply to them in sequence. <\/p><p>  The minutes provide no transparency in any sense.  It is slightly helpful to know what was discussed but it really does not tell the full story is in any sense, the issue is the access and the immediate availability at the very heart of Government by these massively powerful industry players in the financial market system, which I contend in reality is a dictatorship over the European Union.<\/p><p>  At the January meeting of the IFSC Clearing House Group, the issue of REITs, real estate investment trusts was raised, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and Public Expenditure went so far as to suggest that to parallel the IFSC, they might establish a real estate services group type of set up along the same lines.  What discussions are going on in regard to this?  The suggestion of a global centre of excellence for property - and a company was mentioned, Annaly Capital, a United States real estate speculator - coming in and being a major player in this country.  I have seen a suggestion elsewhere that this is an excellent time to come into the &quot;Irish market&quot;, and similar to NAMA, take over properties at a haircut price which was subsidised by the taxpayer and now there is a proposal that these people come in and buy up property at the lowest rate and make a massive killing when the property appreciates at the expense of the people.  Is it proposed that companies can buy mortgage portfolios in this country, which would be an issue of great concern to ordinary people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052200008#J01000","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369230600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>As the Deputy suggested, I noted the points he raised.<\/p><p>  Government policy is to try to create jobs in this industry and it wants the Clearing House Group as part of that.

That is one of its key issues.  The property tax is causing huge grief for hundreds of thousands of households that have already been massively hit and simply cannot afford it.  If they pay it, it will impose a massive burden on them.  I will not, however, get into the ongoing battle against it.  It has been introduced as a direct result of the crash of financial services that led to the crash in the real economy.  The people are paying for this, but the players who were centrally involved in causing the crash have unprecedented access to the Government.  The taxpayer has no such access.

It would be of interest to the committee.<\/p><p>  We have seen a significant attack on Ireland Inc. in the past couple of weeks.  I refer to what happened at a Westminster committee with reference to Google and what happened at a US Senate committee hearing with reference to Apple.  The impression is being created that Ireland is some sort of tax haven for large multinational corporations.  Some people in the United States and the United Kingdom are trying to say large corporations such as Google and Apple are working through Ireland to defraud the taxpayer in these countries of massive amounts of tax.  It is important that Mr. Fraser give the committee some response or make some points in that regard.  It seems that Google paid just &euro;3 million in corporation tax in Ireland.  It has been suggested that if it was paying corporation tax on what some regard as its profits, it would have to pay more than &euro;1 billion.<\/p><p>  I will explain what has actually happened.  This should be the course of the discussion at US Senate and Westminster committees.  Many countries have bilateral tax agreements with each other.  There are bilateral agreements between the United Kingdom, the United States, Ireland and a host of other countries across the world.  Those concerned about what is going on in Google or Apple do not mention these agreements which relate purely to what we do in Ireland.  There is a need for Mr. Fraser to make a statement in that regard.  We are being seen as the bad boys with regard to corporation tax, but that is not true.  Many of the issues involved relate to the bilateral tax agreements all countries have with each other.  If we had an opportunity to drill into this issue - I will not do so now - we would see that some of the historical approaches to taxes in the United States, for instance, have contributed to the situation where multinationals are seen as avoiding what is considered by some to be their fair share.  I would like Mr. Fraser to comment on this.  This is the place for such a comment to be made because this committee deals with these issues.<\/p><p>  The approach being taken by the Department of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach in setting and implementing priorities is very important.  All too often, programmes for Government have been written year after year before taking on the same life as the policy documents written by the Department of Health that I used to see - they gather dust in the corner of someone's office.  When priorities are set, it is important that people are made to implement them.  One of the big problems I noted in the course of the Celtic tiger was that many did not realise that their good salaries meant they had responsibilities to the people who were paying those salaries.  One of these responsibilities was to implement priorities, which is what is being done now.  I commend the different approach to government now being adopted.  It is about being responsible and accountable.  There is far greater transparency, regardless of the impression given today that there is some kind of conspiracy.  I actually think there is much greater transparency in government at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013052200009#K00400","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369231200,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I have mentioned the National Economic and Social Council as an example of another group that I chair.

There is a wide variety of people at every meeting and it has done a lot of work.  Its most recent report which relates to the people who have suffered most in our society as a result of the economic crash was published a week or two ago.

As Members of the Oireachtas, our role is to challenge at every opportunity and ensure rigour and transparency are applied.  That is what the joint committee is doing today.  There is a certain perception about the way in which the Irish Financial Services Centre Clearing House Group operates and it is useful to examine it in the cold light of day.  Everybody welcomes the number of jobs being created in this area and we hope employment numbers in it will increase.  The announcement last week that an additional 800 jobs would be created in my constituency of Dublin South East was very welcome.  I thank Mr. Fraser for any role he may have played in securing these jobs. <\/p><p>   I view my role in this House as one of trying to fix the mistakes of the past and ensuring they are never repeated.

It is important that a light is shone on this issue.

Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rules of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  This is a particularly important meeting.  It is useful because we are in public session and the public will hopefully be listening in and have an opportunity to hear what we have to say this morning.  It will probably be the first of a number of engagements between the committee and the IHREC members and I invite Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally to make an opening statement on behalf of the members designate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013052200002#A00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369213500,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee.  We are delighted to be here this morning and we thank the committee for the invitation to appear.  My colleagues have asked me to give a brief opening statement on behalf of the members designate of the IHREC.  I understand the committee would like to discuss any suggestions and proposals we as members designate may have on our future role within the commission.<\/p><p>  This year, 2013, marks the 15th anniversary of the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement, which was the catalyst for deepening and strengthening the human rights and equality architecture in Ireland.  The challenges facing human rights and equality are many, but we also believe opportunities now arise and we are keen to see these realised during the terms of our mandates.  The financial crisis and austerity measures have created significant hardship for many people and raise very pressing questions of human rights, justice and equality.  As members designate of the IHREC, we are acutely aware of the need to ensure the new equality and human rights infrastructure that is being created must effectively promote and vindicate the rights of all persons.<\/p><p>  We have no doubt that this will be a challenging task.  Both the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, have played important roles in the protection of the rights of some of the most vulnerable groups in Irish society.  We are determined to build on this work and to ensure the IHREC will meet its objective of enhancing the protection of human rights, dignity and equality.<\/p><p>  We are appearing today as members designate of the IHREC.  We were formerly appointed members of the IHRC.  Our status with regard to the Equality Authority has not yet been resolved, and the transitional arrangements on that are not yet complete.  There are many challenging tasks facing the Equality Authority, both in terms of its ongoing work and in the context of preparations for a successful and effective merger.  We are very hopeful that these transitional arrangements will be completed as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  As members will know, the UN Paris Principles emphasise the critical importance of the independence of the selection and appointment processes for both commissioners and senior staff of national human rights institutions, NHRIs.  To date, the selection committee appointed to oversee the nomination of commissioners designate has played a crucial role in establishing the credibility of the new body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013052200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369213500,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Is it commissioner or commissioner designate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013052200003#B00200","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369213500,"counter":438,"content":"<p>It is both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013052200003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally"},{"type":"speech","time":1369213500,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Mullally for her opening statement.

Our starting point has been to look at the very steep reduction in resources which effectively has been imposed on the two existing bodies.  One of the statistics that has struck us particularly is that where the Equality Authority is concerned, from the start of 2012 to the end of this year we anticipate there will have been a 75% reduction in staff.  In fact, the current position is that only 11 or 12 staff are expected to transfer on a legacy basis to the new bodies.  By any standards, that is manifestly adequate to discharge the existing functions.  However, it is not just a question of discharging the existing functions because the heads of the Bill which the committee has previously considered clearly provide for some very interesting new functions.  There will be a specific social cohesion function, including promoting the integration of migrants and encouraging good practice in intercultural relations, which we very much welcome.  An exciting new public sector duty will be introduced and the new commission will have a role in supporting public bodies in breathing life into that public sector duty in order to more effectively mainstream human rights and equality considerations not just in law but also in the policy and practice of public sector bodies.<\/p><p>  In her introduction Professor Mullally referred to two further areas that are very much on our radar.  They are for the future, but they are also, in a sense, legacies of the past.  In 2007 the Government did not ratify the two conventions Professor Mullally mentioned - the optional protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Both foresee the establishment of monitoring mechanisms at national level to give further effect to international work under these two conventions.  Plainly there is potential for the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to play a significant role in these national monitoring functions.  It is now nearly eight years since the signature of the two conventions.  As we look ahead, it is only prudent to predict that there will also be a staffing and capacity need for both.<\/p><p>  I will ask Mr. Conaty to go into more detail on our thinking about the staffing issue and the level of need involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013052200004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369214100,"counter":449,"content":"<p>The resource difficulties are well acknowledged, as my colleague has pointed out.

It is about how people enjoy their family rights, their rights to education and access to all that to which they have entitlement.  What must preoccupy all of the human rights organisations across Europe is how we are preserving these core human rights that have built our society to this level if we are not focusing forensically on the impact of our budgets and the decisions made in places like here and Europe on the actual lives of real people who look to us for street cred.

Agreed.  Finally, on behalf of the committee, I would welcome the further engagement you outlined.  There is a new system now for the heads of a Bill.  It is very exciting, although it means a great deal more work for us.  The heads of a Bill come to the committee and we have a very interesting format whereby we invite submissions.

I spoke about the issues address in the amendments in my contribution on Second Stage.  It would be great if the Minister were to accept amendment No. 3 and disappointing if he were to choose not to accept it as it is technical in nature.  As I outlined on Second Stage, the guidelines for putting in place a personal insolvency arrangement provide that the timeframe for doing so must be more than three months.  The issue, therefore, is that this legislation gives the borrower and personal insolvency practitioner two months to reach a personal insolvency arrangement.  To produce a personal insolvency arrangement, the personal insolvency practitioner must review the case, including the financial statement and submit an application for a protective certificate to the personal insolvency service.  The personal insolvency legislation stipulates that a personal insolvency practitioner has 70 days to develop a proposal, have it voted on by the creditors and submit it to the court for assessment.  The personal insolvency practitioner must also ensure that creditors representing 65% or more of the total debt agree to the proposal and record the creditors' meeting results, etc.  The amendments propose a technical change because the two month timeframe provided for in this legislation appears to be contrary to the current guidelines.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that if and when the court directs the borrower and lender to develop a personal insolvency arrangement, they will have sufficient time to do so.  Two months does not appear to be a sufficient period and for this reason I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 7 relates to the costs and who pays for the personal insolvency arrangement.  When the judge orders the borrower and lender to draw up a personal insolvency arrangement, a question arises as to who pays the cost of engaging a personal insolvency practitioner.  This issue remains unresolved.  We will have to wait and see how it plays out in the normal course of a personal insolvency arrangement, for which a market price has not yet been set.  It may be the case that the fees for the personal insolvency practitioner will be paid from future payments made by the borrower and, as a result, the lender will de facto take the hit as this would manifest itself in lower debt repayments.<\/p><p>  My specific concern is that where a bank moves for repossession, it is reasonable to assume the borrower who is about to lose his or her home will be in a distressed position and have virtually no means.  The chances that he or she will have sufficient income in the subsequent few years are also slim.  As there is no requirement on a personal insolvency practitioner to take on the case, I am concerned that personal insolvency practitioners will refuse to engage because they will realise that the banks have a veto and do not have to agree to anything.  The banks will simply state they engaged in the process before returning to court to obtain possession of the borrower's house.  This is how I believe the scenario will play out in most cases.  There is a real fear that personal insolvency practitioners will decide that neither the bank nor borrowers will pay their costs and will refuse to draw up a personal insolvency arrangement.  As a result, borrowers will either be unable to engage a personal insolvency practitioner or they will only find one who is not very good and is taking on work that others may not want to do.  The proposed solution in this case is that the lender should pay the costs of the personal insolvency practitioner.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200003#B00300","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1369227600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for tabling these amendments as it gives us an additional opportunity to tease out the Bill.  I am afraid I am not willing to accept amendment No. 1 for a number of reasons.  It attempts to replace the carefully worded proposal contained in the Bill with a much broader proposal, which seeks to substantially rewrite the relevant provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  The intention behind section 2 is to provide that a court may, of its own motion or on request, adjourn proceedings to allow a personal insolvency arrangement to be considered where, for example, none had previously been attempted, as with the requirement in bankruptcy petitions.  The purpose is to make an appropriate link with the insolvency provisions contained in the 2012 Act.  There is no provision, nor could there be such provision, as is suggested in the amendment, that a court should direct that a personal insolvency arrangement be considered.<\/p><p>  On a more specific point, the proposed amendment provides that a court shall &quot;instruct a personal insolvency practitioner to make a proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement under the Act of 2012&quot;.  The court cannot have the role envisaged in the amendment as such a role would run counter to the voluntary nature of the debt resolution process in the personal insolvency legislation.  The court has no power of instruction in regard to a voluntary process.  A personal insolvency arrangement can only be proposed by a debtor through a personal insolvency practitioner where a debtor meets the eligibility requirements for such an arrangement and there are sufficient funds available to make some payments to ground a proposal.  The proposed amendment has no regard for either the context or appropriateness of such a proposal over the debtor's repayment capacity.  In any event, the proposed amendment could not have any lawful effect in binding a creditor.  <\/p><p>  The amendment seems to consider the personal insolvency practitioner is an officer of the court.  This is a fundamental misreading of the legislation.  The personal insolvency practitioner has no role or standing in an application for repossession.  There is no provision in the law to provide for the court to appoint the practitioner as an officer to essentially force a settlement on creditors.  I cannot accept the provisions outlined in paragraph (<i>d<\/i>) of amendment No. 1, which are replicated in amendment No. 7, as they seek to impose a duty on the court with regard to the costs of a personal insolvency arrangement.  There is no lawful provision to allow for such, nor could one be imposed.  Again, this runs counter to the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act.  <\/p><p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 2 and 3 which propose an increase in the two month time limit for the adjournment, as I stated on Second Stage, the Bill includes a provision at section 2(4) which allows the court to consider granting a further adjournment if, by the end of the two month period, it sees real evidence of progress towards a personal insolvency arrangement.  I direct the attention of members specifically to the wording of subsection (4) which prescribes the following: &quot;On the expiry of any period of adjournment granted under <i>subsection (2)<\/i>, the court may grant a further adjournment of the proceedings concerned where it considers that significant progress has been made in the preparation of a proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200003#B00400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369228200,"counter":500,"content":"<p>The Minister's response to the amendments is the fundamental difficulty in that he is putting forward legislation that closes a loophole and thus facilitates the repossession of homes.  The environment for families who find themselves in that position is extremely difficult.  On the issue of the two month period, the Minister said that under section 2, subsection (4) that period can be extended but people are working within a defined process.  From the get-go they are told there is a likelihood that the court will adjourn for two months if this Bill goes through as it is.  They are being told that they have two months to go to a personal insolvency practitioner to try to put together a proposition that the bank can accept.  Of course, the bank has a veto on these matters and that is a failing in the personal insolvency legislation.<\/p><p>  The framework, in my view and my party's view, favours the bank, that is, the lender.  The responsibility and onus is put almost entirely on the borrower to put together a proposal within a defined timeframe of two months.  I cannot understand why the Minister cannot extend that and indeed, Deputy Donnelly has explained better than I have why the timeframe should be extended.  The borrower will have to go back to court to get that timeframe extended.  Why is the Minister putting that additional stress on the borrower unnecessarily, when he could just agree to extend the period to six months?  The Minister should extend the period to six months and put the onus of responsibility onto the bank to secure the services of the personal insolvency practitioner.  Why?  The simple answer is the cost.  This is the difficulty with the personal insolvency legislation as it is framed and the environment at the moment.  The financial burden will be on the person who is already in financial distress and we have no definite clarification on whether,  when it comes to a final settlement - assuming there is an agreement - the lender will have to share the burden of the costs.  <\/p><p> The Minister is closing down a loophole.  None of us likes loopholes but the difficulty is that when the Minister closes down the loophole and opens up the potential for banks to seek repossessions, the environment for those who are in financial distress is not solid.  The onus of responsibility is more heavily placed on the person in financial distress than on the banks that are chasing him or her down.  The bigger issue, of course, is the banks themselves.  Where is the overall sharing of responsibility?  We know how this crisis came about.  It was caused by the recklessness of the banking sector and the failure of economists and politicians who facilitated an environment in which money was lent recklessly to people whose debts became unsustainable.  Where is the sharing of responsibility between the financial institutions, along with the so-called experts who allowed that to happen, and the regular five eighths who now find themselves in financial distress?  That is the fundamental difficulty and everything the Minister has said in response to our amendments points to the difficulties and the concerns we have more than anything else.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200004#C00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1369228800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

I am pointing out that we have not addressed it yet.  The Minister has spoken to the timing issue and not to the cost issue.<\/p><p>  As I said on Second Stage, I greatly welcome this additional protection, which is a variation of the Bill I proposed approximately 18 months ago.  That Bill sought additional protections when the banks move for possession.  I am delighted to see it here.  I acknowledge again, as I did on Second Stage, that it is fantastic it is in here.  My amendments relate to ensuring it is correct.  The Minister has not spoken to amendment No. 7 relating to cost.  I will wait to hear what he has to say and then reply.<\/p><p>  Let me talk about amendment No. 3.  I take the Minister's point that the proposal takes less time than a court agreement and therefore may not need the four months envisaged through the PIP having to go through.  It is a fair point that all that is being done is putting together a proposal.  However, considerable work remains to be done.  One can imagine the complexity of these cases, many of which do not just focus on mortgage payments but relate to multiple lenders.  When the bank is going for possession, there will be equity in the house.  Typically the bank will not go after the house when it is in negative equity and will just continue to try to bleed the borrower until the house goes into equity and then it will repossess the house.<\/p><p>  This is likely to occur where a borrower or borrowers have multiple debts.  There is equity in the house and they may be able to service their mortgage.  I dealt with such a case in Wicklow last week.  However, with the credit card, business loan, car loan, student loan or whatever it is, they cannot go after them.  As a result, the bank moves in and declares it is not concerned about the borrowers' unsecured creditors, and because it has a secured loan it is taking the house from them.  The idea is that the personal insolvency practitioner is given sufficient time to come back with a sensible counter-proposal.  In that case, much careful negotiation probably needs to be done.  Inevitably, multiple lenders with very different incentives will be involved.  The secured creditor is going after its security, and the credit card company, credit union or whatever will not want to take a 50%, 60% or 70% write-down on the debt.<\/p><p>  There is no right answer to this.  Two months seems too little, based on the complexity involved.  Taking the Minister's point that no agreement needs to be reached, ideally we should leave enough time for the PIP not to have a theoretical proposal but to present to the judge a proposal that has been discussed and is likely to be agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200005#D00500","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1369228800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>We are in the process of preparing one on which we have done a certain amount of work and we need more time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200005#D00600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1369228800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>If that is the case, may I suggest moving it to three months?

Very careful consideration was given to what the period should be.  One could argue for two months, three months or four months.  There are a range of possibilities.  A number of issues were factored into the two month period.  It is important that people do not find themselves in a position where repossession proceedings are issued if there is a practical possibility of them entering into an arrangement.  When court proceedings to repossess are taken, I am conscious that it adds additional cost on to the debtor as well as on to the creditor.<\/p><p>  Once the legislation is in place, I hope the publicity surrounding it and the knowledge that exists will result in any individual who could find himself or herself at the receiving end of proceedings getting help from a personal insolvency practitioner considerably before proceedings are issued.  I am sure it has occurred to the Deputy that it is not a coincidence that it is reasonably likely that the personal insolvency legislation will be in operation before this legislation has completed its passage through the Houses.  There may be symmetry between them, and this Bill might complete its passage by the end of June and the legislation operational by the beginning of July.  This legislation will not reach the Statute Book many months ahead of the personal insolvency legislation coming into operation.<\/p><p>  Anyone who could be the subject of repossession proceedings brought under this legislation will have the facility to consult a personal insolvency practitioner before anyone may issue repossession proceedings.  If repossession proceedings are brought, somebody will not receive court papers on a Monday, be in court on Tuesday and then have two months.  It usually takes a number of weeks between being served with court papers and the matter coming before a court.  A person in this position receiving court papers does not need to wait for a judge to adjourn a case to go to see a personal insolvency practitioner.  Anybody who seeks legal advice on his or her position will immediately be told that if he or she has the funds and is not insolvent, it would be a good idea pay the mortgage and address the arrears.  If the person is not in a financial position to do so, he or she will be advised to consider consulting a personal insolvency practitioner.  A lawyer not giving that advice would not be giving proper advice.<\/p><p>  In advance of the matter first finding its way into court, there will be space for someone to consult the personal insolvency practitioner.  It is important that things are not unnecessarily protracted.  I would anticipate that the time between receiving court papers and the end of the two month adjournment is likely to be in practical terms not less than three months.  It may end up being 11 weeks rather than 12 weeks.  As the Deputy will know, there is always a time gap following receipt of court papers, and that was factored into the consideration.  We need to ensure people who have been not engaged or may have tried the mortgage arrears resolution process and found it did not work for them seek with some reasonable speed whatever help they can get and do not just ignore the fact there are court proceedings.  That is a factor.  It is not just that there are just two months - just over eight weeks.  There is also the run-in to that.<\/p><p>  If it appears possible that an arrangement can be put in place after someone sits down with a personal insolvency practitioner, the court only needs to be satisfied that significant progress has been made in the preparation of a proposal.  Then the court may want to know what length of adjournment is needed to deal with that.  Initially it is to ensure people do not ignore their circumstance and address it.<\/p><p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn talked about closing a loophole and that we are facilitating repossessions.  We need to get real about all of this.  All the way up to 2009, the law was very simple and straightforward.  If someone was in mortgage arrears and failed to meet repayments, the relevant financial institution could initiate court proceedings and get a repossession order <i>simpliciter<\/i>.  That was the law throughout the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries because banks do not lend people money to purchase homes unless they have the security of knowing that if repayments are not made, they can repossess.  That is the very essence of what a mortgage is.<\/p><p>  Of course, the last thing we want for any individual or family in financial difficulty is that they should have their home repossessed.  Owing to the approach taken by the Government introducing procedures requiring banks to engage, there have been very few repossessions in this country since the property crisis hit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200005#D00800","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369229400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>The Minister could mandate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200006#E00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1369229400,"counter":511,"content":"<p>It is one of the things that should be there.

In the context of amendment No. 7, it was something that was suggested during the debate on the Personal Insolvency Bill.  I cannot accept the amendment, however, because I do not think the courts could properly impose on mortgagers the costs of a personal insolvency practitioner.  For example, the personal insolvency practitioner may well, having consulted with the debtor, conclude that there is no possibility of putting in place an arrangement because there is no financial base on which it would be possible for creditors to agree to a personal insolvency arrangement.  One could not then require the financial institution to pay the personal insolvency practitioner's fees.<\/p><p>  It tends to get forgotten that the legislation is not only about mortgages when one is dealing with the 2012 Act, it is also about creditors generally.  I suspect that there would be serious constitutional difficulties in picking out one of the creditors simply because it was a financial institution, and saying it must pay the personal insolvency practitioner's fees, but all the other creditors have no obligation.  It could well be the case - I re-emphasise that this is an insolvency Bill - that someone may have greater debts with creditors other than the creditor concerning their family home.  They may be in difficulties with their family home, but they may have other creditors to whom they owe substantially greater sums of money, other than a financial institution. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200006#E00500","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369230000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I think it could be possible to mandate limited recourse mortgages similar to those in the US.

If it was interested in the latter, it would have already gone down that route.  The judge will then direct it to see if it can get a PIP to put a PIA together.  The PIP will not be paid unless a PIA is agreed.  Deeply distressed borrowers are going to be walking up and down our main streets seeking PIPs to do work in respect of which they know there is a high probability of their not being paid.  That is the problem I am trying to solve.  If forcing the mortgager to pay for it does not work for the Minister, that is fair enough.

What is terribly important is that debtors are not misled as to the practical possibility of entering into personal insolvency arrangements.  One of the ways of ensuring that PIPs will be experts and will put forward practical proposals - they will put forward only proposals which are practical - is that they will not be paid unless the proposal is agreed.  I am sure people will take up work in this area as personal insolvency practitioners on the understanding that if an agreement and a resolution are not brought about, they will not be paid.  There will be people willing to work on that basis.  Let us consider the issue raised by the Deputy in respect of inexperienced people who, perhaps, lack the capacity to resolve issues effectively as intermediaries between debtors and creditors and who simply make up proposals which have no chance of success and for which they are paid a fee.

A well-trained PIP who is familiar with the workings of the legislation, who is doing his or her job responsibly and who is familiar with the relevant regulations should, once the debtor has furnished all the financial background information on assets, income and debts, fairly rapidly be in a position to conclude whether there is a practical possibility of putting together a proposal that has some possibility of success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200007#F00700","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1369230000,"counter":521,"content":"<p>It is very important that the PIP should be able to return to the judge and state that he or she has considered the situation, that he or she has put together a proposal which meets the guidelines relating to the insolvency service, that it is the same sort of proposal being accepted by lenders X, Y and Z and that the bank to which it has been put is refusing to play ball.  The latter might state that it is not interested, that the house has equity in it and that it is taking that equity and applying the veto.  This also goes to another amendment we will be discussing later.  It is extremely important that a PIP should be in a position to return to a judge in order to give to him or her the type of evidence to which I refer.  However, no PIP is going to do that.  The Minister said so himself.  If a PIP is of the view that the bank will not agree to a proposal, then he or she will not spend any more time working on it.  We have a problem because there will be borrowers who will be unable to gain access to a PIP.  As the Minister stated, PIPs are highly-trained business people and they will know that certain banks will not accept proposals of a particular type.  They will inform borrowers that they are not going to get anywhere because it will not be possible to reach agreement with the banks and then bid them goodbye.  Borrowers will be stuck on the side of the street with nowhere to go.  That is the problem we face and I do not see any solution to it.<\/p><p>  I hope the number of people who will be affected in this way will be tiny but there is no doubt that it will happen.  Perhaps it might be possible to establish a central fund which could be used in respect of a limited number of cases.  If a judge believes it might be possible to develop a proposal, if the borrower involved tries to come up with one and if the PIP he or she approaches states that it will not be possible to provide assistance because of the threat of non-payment, surely something should be done in such circumstances.  Perhaps moneys could be provided out of a central fund in order that the borrower in question might consult a PIP, have the situation explained to him or her by the latter and then go back before the judge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200007#F00800","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1369230000,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I wish to bring to members attention the fact that the buttons for their microphones are not working.

However, I cannot start redrafting legislation and making special financial arrangements in respect of one discrete part which applies to the repossession proceedings relating to family homes but which does not apply to the remainder of it.  There is no practical way of so dealing with matters.  Even in the absence of the personal insolvency legislation, the courts have - with great regularity - adjourned proceedings where someone who is about to have his or her home repossessed sets out to the relevant judge a practical proposition and states that he or she will have sufficient funds in two to three months in order to allow him or her to pay his or her arrears or that he or she needs time to discuss matters with his or her bank.

I have no idea whether what I have proposed would pass the Office of the Attorney General because we do not have access to such a resource.  However, I suggest the Minister would consider the issue I am raising.  It relates to a situation where a family home is possessed because of bad debt in a buy-to-let scenario.  We could have a situation whereby a family has decided that pension pots are not the way to go, for a variety of smart reasons, and has decided to invest in a buy-to-let.  For a variety of reasons the buy-to-let is not performing, partly because PRSI is paid on the income and they do not get to net off their costs against their revenue, as in any other business, and for several other Government-created reasons thanks to this Government and the last.  The family income is more than adequate to service the family home.  The bank can possess the buy-to let but it can also go after the family home because the equity will be in the family home.  It does not seem like a sensible social outcome for people to lose their family homes because of a distressed buy-to-let when they can pay the mortgage on the family home.  It is entirely possible that the only reason the buy-to-let is in financial difficulty is because of changes that came in to the buy-to-let market through Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  That party took a business and did to it what has not been done to any other business in the country.  It provided that when it was taxing profits, these particular businesses were no longer able to net off full costs against revenue.  It was an outrageous thing to do.  If one did this to any other business it would collapse.  It was a preposterous thing to do but it was exacerbated greatly in the last budget when the Government decided to charge PRSI on rental income.  We have a unique business sector whose rules if they were applied to any other sector would ensure that large swathes of businesses would go out of business in the morning.  Landlords, for whatever reason, must deal with this nonsense.

Basically, I want to try to put a little responsibility back on the lenders to act in a responsible way.  The Minister, his officials and several of us have gone to a great deal of effort to try to get some insolvency arrangements, a mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, and a code of conduct in place with all types of statutory and voluntary guidelines and laws.  However, the arrangements give vast scope to the lender.  For example, a lender is allowed designate a borrower as non-co-operating for a variety of reasons.  For example, if the borrower does not reply to a request from the lender within a given time that the bank deems reasonable, then the bank can deem the borrower to be non-co-operating and it can do so for a variety of other ridiculous reasons as well.  If the borrower wants to appeal the decision of the bank, the only entity he can appeal to is the bank.  There is no independent appeal or no serious oversight.<\/p><p>  We have heard a great deal of talk about strategic defaulters and those who cannot pay versus those who will not pay as well as a complete misuse of the phrase \"moral hazard\", a term which many who use do not seem to understand, but remarkably little about the conduct of the banks.  The banks can apply vetoes, designate people as non-co-operating and all sorts of other things.  I am trying to do something simple with this amendment.  I am trying to add some elements to the Bill which provide that when the judge is considering a possession order he can consider whether the bank has adhered to such things as the code of conduct.<\/p><p>  As the Minister stated earlier, if a personal insolvency practitioner make the case that he and the client have put a proposal together and he believes it is a reasonable proposal and it is a standard proposal that is accepted by other banks, but the bank in question, for whatever reason, is unwilling to accept it, it is explicit in the legislation that the judge can take that into account.

It is fair to say we are all trying to achieve a balance of fairness in the legislation.

Throughout his presentation and previously the Minister has referenced differentiating between the people who cannot pay and those who will not pay.  Deputy Donnelly has referred to them as strategic defaulters but I would rather refer to them as tactical defaulters.

The fact that the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is the rule book lenders must follow should be given more emphasis in the legislation.  When a borrower is dealing with a financial institution, in many respects he will have less of a professional, financial or legal back-up and fewer resources available to him in negotiations.  In many respects the bank will have endless resources available.

On proposed amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 10, I consider these requirements already to be adequately covered in section 2(3), which provides that the court &quot;shall have regard to such matters as it considers appropriate&quot;.  The Deputies might note this point in particular because the provision continues by stating &quot;and in particular shall have regard to the following&quot; and then lists them out in paragraphs (<i>a<\/i>) to (<i>e<\/i>) of section 2(3).  Basically, however, the court can consider any matter it determines to be appropriate.  It is not limited to those which have been provided for in particular.  This gives a court a broad discretion to determine to what it should have regard.  Furthermore, in respect of the conduct of mortgagees, section 2(3)(<i>d<\/i>) already provides that the court shall have regard to &quot;the conduct of the parties to the mortgage in any attempt to find a resolution to the issue of dealing with arrears of payments due on foot of the mortgage&quot;.  As I noted on Second Stage, it already is clear that courts are taking the behaviour of the parties, including mortgagees, into account when ruling on proceedings.  I made reference earlier this afternoon to the courts exercising discretion even without either this legislation or the insolvency legislation being in place, whereby judges simply adjourn cases for periods.  However, in the context of taking into account the behaviour of the parties, there is the example of the recent case of Irish Life and Permanent PLC <i>v<\/i>. Duff, in which the High Court refused to order repossession, at least partly on the grounds that the bank had not complied with the provisions of the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Nothing in this Bill changes that approach if the courts regard that to be, in the context of an individual case, an appropriate matter to which have regard.  Consequently, this already is occurring without the enactment of the legislation or indeed without the insolvency legislation having come into operation.<\/p><p>  One further point I wish to make on amendment No. 10 relates to the proposal in paragraph (<i>c<\/i>) that the court should consider whether, when a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, has been rejected by creditors, the mortgagor has been given adequate opportunity to appeal the substantive decision of the mortgagee to reject the proposal.  This amendment completely misunderstands the way in which the PIA process works.  As I have stated many times, it is a voluntary process and where the necessary approval of creditors cannot be obtained on the proposal, the process then ends.  There is no appeal to the court in this regard.  There exists a possibility that the mortgagor could, through his or her personal insolvency practitioner and where time permits under the protective certificate period, propose a new arrangement which could meet with the approval of creditors.<\/p><p>  I cannot accept amendment No. 9 for a number of reasons.  The amendment seeks to rewrite provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act, which is not the purpose of this Bill.  Overall, the amendment is poorly drafted, confused or somewhat disingenuous as to its intentions and is not acceptable.  The select committee should be aware that the protection to a mortgagor proposed by this Bill is to require that the court allow for a personal insolvency arrangement to be considered where, for example, none previously had been attempted, as with the requirement now in bankruptcy petitions, and not that the court should direct a first or a new PIA and effectively determine its outcome.  Once a PIA proposal has been rejected by the creditors' meeting and no subsequent proposal is made during the protective certificate period, the personal insolvency practitioner's role ends as a mediator or negotiator for the debtor.  However, members should remember that where a proposal is rejected at a creditors' meeting and where the protective certificate period still exists, this does not stop a personal insolvency practitioner making a different proposal that creditors may accept.  Therefore, once a proposal has been rejected and where there is no other proposal that can properly be made within the timeframe, the personal insolvency practitioner has no standing whatsoever in the repossession process and the law does not provide for the court to appoint him or her as an officer essentially to force a settlement on creditors as such a practitioner cannot do that.<\/p><p>  The amendment ignores the fact that the personal insolvency legislation is designed to allow agreed settlements to be reached as an alternative to court-ordered settlements.  It is my view this amendment would overturn this carefully calibrated approach.  I must add the Deputy's proposed provision that a PIA proposal should only offer to repay the current value of a property would represent a huge interference in contractual and property rights and would be likely to be subject to swift challenge in the courts.  The amendment makes no reference to the repayment capacity of the debtor, which it seems essentially would be determined by the current value of the property.  This would have obvious negative consequences for banks, other financial institutions and ultimately for the taxpayer.  I believe this amendment could encourage delinquent behaviour on the part of all debtors, nearly 90% of whom are repaying their mortgages, in order to get their mortgages reduced to present value.  This would seriously risk a complete collapse of the property market and would threaten the solvency of the financial institutions and the economy.  Finally, I consider that this amendment would run the risk of turning every proposal for a PIA into a costly preliminary to repossession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200009#H00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1369231200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and am somewhat comforted by his reply on section 2(3) and in particular regarding section 2(3)(<i>d<\/i>) where reference is made to the conduct of the parties to the mortgage.

Therefore, I presume the reason that paragraphs (<i>a<\/i>) to (<i>e<\/i>) have been included is for emphasis to back it up.  Consequently, this is all a question of legal emphasis.  I am not a lawyer but I presume that is the reason these provisions were included, even if everything is covered.  I appreciate the Minister will not accept amendment No. 4 but I ask him to think again about where he wishes to place the emphasis.  The Minister has chosen to place the emphasis in areas outlined in paragraphs (<i>a<\/i>) to (<i>e<\/i>).  The reason I specifically highlighted the issue outlined in amendment No. 4, as opposed to a wide variety of other matters one could emphasise, was because of the scale of the problem.  For example, one in three buy-to-let mortgages is now either in arrears or has been restructured, so-called, but actually has simply been put on the never-never.  This figure is growing exponentially and is a huge problem.  This is not a marginal issue as it now affects one in three such mortgages and at the current rate, it will affect one in two soon enough, probably by the end of the year.  I can forward details on this exponential growth to the Minister if he wishes, as it is absolutely terrifying.  Therefore, the reason I have emphasised this issue is that I believe it affects many people who, apart from this one thing they deeply regret, namely, buying a house, apartment or whatever it was, otherwise are solvent and are fine.  I believe the banks will take the house from such people because the banks will act rationally and it is rational for them to make good on their security.  I ask the Minister to consider this issue, as the reason I have included it is because it is a huge problem.  Were the banks to act entirely according to their own self-interest, which it is rational for them to do, one could see many people in a very tricky position.  Consequently, before Report Stage, I ask the Minister to consider including a provision that emphasised this point for the courts as well.

One could argue back and forth that the borrower under existing arrangements and legislation and working with a personal insolvency practitioner has to make a case to the bank and the bank has a veto.  The question is whether people had a chance and if when the bank rejected the proposal if they went back to the drawing board to try again.  That is the intent.  One could formalise it by referring to appeals in law but a logical point is being made as to whether every reasonable effort has been made to examine the proposal from the personal insolvency practitioner and the borrower before one would make such a major decision.

The language in 2(3)(<i>d<\/i>) is more economical but it covers all the particular instances Deputy Mac Lochlainn wants added to it.  Therefore, the amendment does not actually add anything.  If anything was excluded it would fall into the general provision the court considers appropriate that is referenced.<\/p><p>  Deputy Donnelly said specifying particular scenarios added emphasis.

If one takes the first principle, which involves a rental property, a family home and a proposal for a PIA, one will have to work out a proposal where it is a practical financial proposal to allow the debtor stay in his or her home, unless it is a mansion.  One starts off on that premise.  It cannot be the case that one forces someone to sell his or her home and the rental property and leaves them homeless.  The bias and the purpose of the PIA is to protect the person in the home.  That applies whether or not there is a rental investment.<\/p><p>  Section 104(3) outlines the circumstances in which the home can be sold under a PIA.  In section 104(3)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Personal Insolvency Act the debtor confirms in writing to the personal insolvency practitioner that the debtor does not wish to remain in occupation of his or her principal, private residence.  That is straightforward.  In the second case the personal insolvency practitioner has, having discussed the issue with the debtor, formed the opinion that taking account of the matters referred to in 104(2) &ndash; I can list them if members wish &ndash; the costs of continuing to reside in the debtor&rsquo;s principal private residence are disproportionately large.  That is what I describe as a very large home, someone living in a home that is not essential for them to have a roof over their head.  It is a very nice home, it is large but it is not practical in the current financial circumstances.  Those are effectively the factors.<\/p><p>  Section 104(4) outlines that personal insolvency arrangements should not contain terms providing for the disposal of the debtor&rsquo;s interest in the principal family residence &ndash; this is even where they agree to it -  unless the debtor has obtained independent legal advice on such disposal or having been advised by the personal insolvency practitioner to obtain legal advice and declined to do so.  One also has to have regard to the protections for family homes that apply under the Family Home Protection Act and the Civil Partnership Act 2010.<\/p><p>  I will conclude on this point.  In Deputy Donnelly&rsquo;s example, the particular provision he suggested be included is not needed because the protections are within the insolvency legislation.  Where there are difficulties with an investment property and there is a family home and where the background indicates there is a reasonable PIA that can be entered into, it may produce a sale of the investment property but it will not produce the sale of the family home unless it is extraordinarily large and then clearly the arrangement will envisage some funds being made available to the debtor for a smaller home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200010#J00600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1369231800,"counter":559,"content":"<p>That is great for the PIA but this legislation comes after the PIA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200010#J00700","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1369231800,"counter":560,"content":"<p>They are being taken together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013052200010#J00800","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1369231800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I know.

This was an issue on which we had some exchanges on Second Stage.  I fully appreciate the intention behind the amendment.  All repossession cases relating to housing loan mortgages created after 1 December 2009 must, under section 101(4) of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, be commenced in the Circuit Court.  There is a logic to the argument that the same limitation should apply to similar mortgages created before that date.  From my discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, however, it might not be sufficient to insert a definition of court meaning Circuit Court as suggested in the amendment.  Discussions with the Attorney General's office are continuing and I hope to be in a position to address this issue with an appropriate amendment on Report Stage, which will have the effect of ensuring repossession cases involving the family home or principal private residence are always commenced in the Circuit Court.  In these circumstances, perhaps Deputy Mac Lochlainn would agree to withdrawing the amendment.

Recovering from and implementing important changes in response to the very significant editorial mistakes made in the \"Mission to Prey\" and \"Frontline\" presidential debate programmes in 2011 was a key priority for RTE throughout last year.  Informed by the findings and recommendations from external investigations and reports, we completely restructured RTE television current affairs. The changes were made to ensure greater clarity in the editorial management chain and to allow for an increased focus on journalism and editorial decision making at the programme level.<\/p><p>  As part of the restructuring, we announced we were changing our approach to investigative journalism through the establishment of a new RTE investigations unit. The new unit will now be responsible for managing and producing RTE's key investigative journalism output for television, radio and online.  RTE also made key appointments to the most senior positions within the restructured RTE news and current affairs division at the levels of managing director, managing editor, programme editor and head of the new RTE investigations unit.<\/p><p>  At a group wide level, we created a new role of head of editorial standards and set up an editorial standards board to support and challenge programme makers, particularly those involved in high-risk programming.  In addition, we completely updated RTE's journalism guidelines during early 2012.  We have also included new guidelines for social media and rolled out training for all editorial staff across the year.  Many of the changes we have made have become apparent to our audience with a refreshed multi-format \"Prime Time\" running three nights a week and a new morning news programme, \"Morning Edition\", both beginning earlier this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013052200003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Curran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369212300,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Curran for that overview.

Is it funded to the end of the year without making additional cuts to wages or staff reductions over and above what has been identified?  Does RTE have to make further payroll savings next year by way of wage or staff reductions?<\/p><p>  With regard to the modernisation of the organisation, Mr. Curran has identified a state of flux on the news and current affairs side.  Has a strategic review been conducted of its structure, recognising the development in technology, etc.?  We regularly meet representatives of independent broadcasters and RTE's competitors in television and they have much leaner operations in place.  I do not take from the work RTE does as a public service provider.  That programming requires additional staff and so on.  Has the authority examined the overall tapestry of the organisation from a modernisation perspective to consider right sizing it from a cost saving point of view?<\/p><p>  The position of chief financial officer is still vacant after ten or 11 months.  What action is being taken to fill that position?  What kind of recruitment process will be put in place?  Will the position be publicly advertised and dealt with in the normal way?<\/p><p>  With regard to news and current affairs, when Mr. Bakhurst last appeared before the committee, he was new in the position.  Mr. Curran clearly outlined the background to the issues that had arisen.  I recall terms like \"groupthink\" and references to a haphazard approach to the delineation of responsibility, particularly in the context of Tweetgate.  There was a conflict at the time between who was in charge.  What structures has Mr. Bakhurst put in place to ensure such issues do not arise again?  Mr. Curran referred to the editorial board, which will be helpful.  What ongoing monitoring will be in place to ensure this does not happen again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013052200005#D01000","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369212300,"counter":628,"content":"<p>The commercial market remains difficult.

Many of the activities in which we are engaged are not commercial.  We are highly regulated.  On average we are limited to six minutes advertising per hour on television.

I am not questioning anybody within but it would be naive to suggest there would not be talent out there that could possibly surpass what is already there, and if it does not then RTE should appoint from within.

The first we hope to deliver will be Dundalk IT and we hope this will happen in the coming months.  The partnership there is progressing extremely well.  An aspect of the partnership in Dundalk in which we are particularly interested is its unique set of premises with regard to conferences.  In recent days we have managed to deliver a major European conference to Dundalk in 2015 which will bring 300 delegates from 37 broadcasters throughout Europe.  This is what we will deliver as part of the arrangement.  The plans to move in are progressing quickly.  The next two after Dundalk will be Waterford and Athlone.  We must sort out the details and we hope to be in all three by the end of the year.  For different reasons Sligo and Galway are trickier in terms of physically moving but we are still pursuing other elements of partnership because all of the institutes of technology are interested in working with us on various projects.  They are keen to be involved with RTE in various partnership arrangements.  It is moving ahead.  Overall restructuring in the regions is saving us a substantial amount of money each year in running costs.  The partnership has enabled us to maintain our presence in the regions.

RTE has learned from the well-publicised hiccups and is working on them.<\/p><p>  First, the main issue is the challenging financial situation for RTE and all media and broadcasters.  Did I pick the witnesses up correctly about a net deficit in 2012 of &euro;60 million, largely due to restructuring?  That restructuring has been impressive and, in respect of the highest earners in particular, necessary.  People use the term \"low-hanging fruit\".  As I suspect that fruit is gone, any future reduction in financial support will have a proportionately greater impact on RTE's ability to produce programmes.  Assuming that advertising revenue will not increase in the next two to three years, does RTE anticipate an increase in public funding when the proposed broadcasting charge is introduced?  Is RTE in the same position as hospitals, local government and so on, in that there will be reductions in the public service element of its budget in the next three to five years?  As opposed to the sustainability plan, what is the survivability plan?<\/p><p>  Second, RTE possesses detailed guidelines on impartiality and fairness in the coverage of news, politics and current affairs, but I am unsure how adherence to them is monitored or implemented.

Every time certain politicians appear on a news or current affairs programme, the ensuing discussion is not on their policies, but on their backgrounds.

We will report a deficit in excess of &euro;60 million for 2012, the majority of which has to do with a one-off, large restructuring charge.  That charge was necessary to downsize RTE yet again.  In 2013, our cost base will be in the order of &euro;314 million, almost 30% lower than it was in 2008.  This is significant.  We have tried to make cuts strategically so that they do not affect the audience.  Obviously, the audience sees the effect, but it is a question of minimising that effect.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that, in making the cuts, one of the metrics we used related to the first-run hours of transmission of indigenous-made programmes.  We have worked on maintaining those hours.  Although there has been a reduction, it has amounted only to approximately 6% on RTE 1 and RTE 2.

That is what interests people.  Certainly that is what preoccupies the people in my constituency with regard to RTE, and I do not think I am representing a constituency that is completely different from all the others.  I looked at the BBC's annual report recently.  I am open to correction but that report states that the BBC has 19 staff who are paid more than &pound;500,000.  Britain's population is roughly 15 times greater than Ireland's and based on what I have read in the media recently about some of the celebrity salaries being paid here I would have thought that well over 100 people in the BBC would be paid more than &pound;500,000.  Mr. Curran said that RTE had paid its presenters too much.  That is refreshing honesty, but does he think they are still being paid too much?  The baseline is definitely too high.  When one reduces something by 20% or 30%, it sounds like a huge percentage but the baseline was far too high.  Deputy O'Mahony is correct that there was a fear they would leave if their salaries were cut.  Realistically, however, where would they go and who would have them?  To be honest, who could afford them?  Certainly nobody in Ireland could.<\/p><p>  With regard to editorial changes, particularly after the \"Twittergate\" incident, there was a move to re-brand and refresh \"The Frontline\" and call it \"Prime Time\" with an audience.  However, when I watch it, it is still the same.  RTE essentially just changed the logo.  Somebody mentioned balance earlier.  As I have often said previously, including to this committee, when one looks at the audience on \"The Frontline\" or \"Prime Time\", there are so many plants in it, it looks like a garden centre.  Contrast the audience for \"Prime Time\" with the audience for BBC's \"Question Time\".  There is a really impartial audience on the BBC programme, but it is not an impartial audience on \"Prime Time\".  It is a hand-picked bunch of repeat performers.  If one watches every week, one sees the same people appearing time and again.  They are planted with loaded questions, invariably to try to land a punch on the unfortunate Government representative.  That is anything but fair.  Some people think that just because RTE re-brands and relaunches it, it will be better in some way but, to be honest, it is the very same.  It is \"The Frontline\" with two presenters rather than one, as far as I am concerned.<\/p><p>  This follows through in the radio programmes.  If one is unfortunate enough to be in a car as often as politicians are and one is listening to talk radio, one might hear Anne from Kilkenny, for example, ring in and lacerate her local representative or the Government representative.  There does not appear to be any clearance or checking to ensure that Anne from Kilkenny is a real person and not Mary from the press office of the main Opposition party, who is sitting in an office in Dublin texting, tweeting and ringing with loaded comments that are then broadcast and taken as fact. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013052200010#J00900","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1369215300,"counter":687,"content":"<p>Do they do that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013052200010#J01000","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1369215300,"counter":688,"content":"<p>Some people, the more unscrupulous politicians, might do it, Chairman.  We saw what this has the potential to do in the presidential election, when a planted, loaded grenade went off in the middle of a \"Prime Time\" programme and did huge damage.  I was never going to vote for the man, but I believe it did huge damage to him.  There should be some type of clearance, whether the programmes are hosted by Marian Finucane, Pat Kenny, Joe Duffy or whoever, because obviously commentary is being planted to do damage to a person politically.  People tend to say, \"There is no smoke without fire.  I heard it on the radio so it must true\".  Perhaps Mr. Curran will comment on that as well.<\/p><p>  Ms O'Keeffe referred to contractors.  To be fair to the committee, we are not talking about people who are painting and decorating or rewiring the place.  The contractors we are referring to are the contractors whose names appear in the newspapers every year.  In view of their salaries, one would be better off getting one of those positions than winning the lotto.  If one wins the lottery, one will win it only once whereas if one gets one of those positions, one will be paid every year.  The low hanging fruit was mentioned.  People from RTE have contacted me, as a member of the committee, in a private capacity.  I have been surprised by how many.  They feel aggrieved because they believe it is the workers in the organisation, particularly the low paid workers, who have taken the hits.  The witnesses have said that staff numbers have been reduced, but they have been reduced primarily where salaries are at the lower end of the scale.  The witnesses can correct me on that if I am mistaken.  Certainly, as Deputy Colreavy said, the public perception is that the low hanging fruit is the employees, while the rich pickings are in a different orchard.  Mr Curran said negotiations will be concluded.  How long are the negotiations with these celebrities under way?  With whom is RTE negotiating?  Is it negotiating with them as individuals or as a group or do they have a trade union?

His firing will be detrimental to his chance of progressing in life and securing jobs that carry responsibilities.  I believe that the buck stops at the manager's desk.  Somebody is responsible for the gross negligence and total lack of protocol and safety measures.  Normally it is the person in charge, the executive who is in control, who is fired.<\/p><p>  The licensing fees of &euro;176 million, and I can be corrected about the figure, allows RTE to fund a public broadcasting service.  It is my firm belief that RTE does not give that amount of service to the community and the general public.  <\/p><p>  I am amazed that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, proposes to increase the &euro;160 television licence fee.  I have made my views on the matter known through the committee and at D&aacute;il level.  It is unacceptable to maintain the current fee, it should be reduced.  People can no longer afford such exorbitant fees being paid to one broadcasting station.  RTE should fund itself by operating in the commercial sector.<\/p><p>  I wish to follow-up on comments made by other speakers.  Deputy Patrick O'Donovan made relevant points and I commend him on stating comparative figures from the BBC.  The RTE presenters and managers do not live in the real world when it comes to finance.  They live on a different planet.  The salaries have been allowed to continue.  Ireland would be the laughing stock of Europe if the salaries were known.  We are a small island nation and that is why the matter is not being broadcast publicly.  The salaries are excessive when compared with the size of the population.<\/p><p>  We have reduced wages.  Let us compare salaries with the salary paid to the President of the United States, the person who wields the most power in the world.  A television and radio presenter here earns three times his salary, another television and radio broadcaster earns over three times and one radio person earns twice the amount.  That gives us food for thought.<\/p><p>  I wish to extend a belated welcome to the delegation.  I should have said it at the start of my presentation.

Please remember that England has 17 times our population.  Historically, only one or two of our people earned that amount.  When the process is done no one will earn that amount.<\/p><p>  A balanced approach is necessary when comparing RTE with the UK.  When I have talked about salaries I have been upfront in stating that the fees being paid were too high and that it was RTE's fault.  Without justifying the fees in any way, one does need to recognise the value of RTE presenters.  RTE is dual-funded and relies on commercial income.  The public respond incredibly positively to the presenters.  Let us make UK comparisons.  The weekend reach by the \"Marian Finucane Show\" is two and half times the comparative reach on BBC's Radio Four.  BBC's \"Newsnight\" gets about 9% share in the UK, \"Channel 4 News\" gets about 3% but \"Prime Time\" gets over 30% and RTE news bulletins get about 40%.  Since Marian Finucane moved to her Saturday show her audience has increased by 51% and her Sunday audience has increased by 47%.  Even given the latest reductions, Joe Duffy's audience has increased by 53% since he moved to his new time slot.  Miriam O'Callaghan presents a current affairs show, a top ten radio show and one of our largest home produced television shows in the summer.  I needed to say all that otherwise one ends up in a confrontational situation, particularly when driving down salaries.  It would be easy for me to grandstand, to say how much we have reduced the salaries and say that we are great.  That is not what I mean.  We realised that the public had a concern and took action which is ongoing.  We will review salaries when contracts end.  Value exists, particularly with comparisons.  The value is determined by the person out front and his or her team.  Many people who are not in the top ten list deliver an equal amount of value.  There must be some recognition of public value.<\/p><p>  In answer to the Deputy's question, we realised that the public were concerned and took action.  I am not seeking a pat on the back.  I do not know of any other area of the economy where salaries or fees have been reduced to this level and we are not finished the process.<\/p><p>  One could get into all sorts of questions on who can afford the salaries.  We consider a range of factors when deciding fees such as audience share, whether the presenter is replaceable, the schedule, the position on the schedule, the commercial revenue and all of that.  RTE's competitors do not publish fees.  Interestingly, several newspapers recently published estimations of fees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013052200011#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Curran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369216500,"counter":697,"content":"<p>There have been significant changes.

I apologise if it seemed I was oblique about contractors, because that was certainly not the intention.  To clarify, Deputy O'Donovan mentioned the BBC figures, in which 19 stars were paid over &pound;22 million.  Deputy O'Donovan cited a figure of &pound;500,000, but in some cases the salaries are well in excess of &pound;2 million.  I accept there is more competition in the UK and the audiences are bigger, but we can put that to one side.  Before RTE adopted the strategy of reducing its top talent, the average of the top ten in 2008 was under &euro;500,000.  It was &euro;444,000.  Before any reductions were taken, that was the figure.  That clarifies the point about contractors.  It refers to a combination of contractors and a couple of employees.  We are not yet finished because negotiations are continuing but, projecting the figure forward, the average in 2013 will be under &euro;300,000, closer to &euro;280,000.  That is a significant reduction in our top talent.  No one is saying that is not a large figure, but it is a substantial reduction.  The reductions were disclosed in March and range from 21% to 68%.  They have been significant, although they pale to insignificance next to the BBC figures.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Donovan mentioned that the pay cuts at RTE involved the lower-paid staff.  The pay cut was taken in 2009.  It was taken very quickly by our staff in response to the economic downturn in 2008.  It was a graduated pay cut from 2.35% for lower earners up to 12.5% for higher earners.  We implemented what was a fair pay scale reduction so people who earned more took more of a cut and those who earned less did not take as much of a cut.<\/p><p>  With regard to exits, we mentioned a figure of 20% of staff leaving between 2008 and 2011.  Over 16% of those were managers, so the exits were not all from the staff element.  They have also been from the higher-paid managerial grades, so we hope balance applied to the cuts in pay and the staff numbers leaving the organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013052200012#L00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369216500,"counter":703,"content":"<p>Deputy Ann Phelan has left, so we will hold her question.<\/p><p>  With regard to the comments made by Deputy Tom Fleming, we have consulted other broadcasters and the person responsible for the guidelines at the BBC.

We should not necessary look at everyone as ideal.  We should try to get a range of views and inputs so that it is not narrow.<\/p><p>  It is important to clarify the issue concerning resignation.  I assume the Deputy meant the previous managing director of news, who was not sacked and has had that clarified in newspapers; he took early retirement.  He is one of the people I respect most out of all of the people I have ever worked with.  He will not be in some wilderness where he will find it hard to find employment.  He is incredibly busy, as one would expect of someone with his range of talents.  With regard to the specific question about me, I have answered it on the previous two occasions I was here.  It is common knowledge that I was prepared to take accountability.  In a leadership position, one must take accountability and show responsibility and leadership.

Has the organisation come through the most difficult editorial crisis in its history?  It is a credit to the organisation that it has.  That is not to say we will not make mistakes again; we will.  We cannot get into the territory of investigative journalism and not make mistakes.  We are trying to minimise the mistakes.<\/p><p>  The Minister has made it clear that he does not see the licence fee increasing and, ultimately, it is his call.  We have been arguing that a whole range of money is lost to the licence fee through evasion, the sound and vision fund, collection fees, the funding of RTE, the funding of TG4, the programming we provide for TG4 and a range of other items.  What we have said is that there is an opportunity to look at overall funding levels if there will be an increase in public funding through some mechanism.<\/p><p>  I disagree with the point that RTE needs to operate more as a commercial concern.  If we are receiving public funding, people must see what is different about us.

With the imminent change from the television licence to whatever broadcasting charge will be implemented, the nature of the relationship of the public will change with that.  There was some cover for those who chose not to pay the &euro;160.  They could kick the television out the window and say they would not watch it anymore.  That is fine but that will not happen anymore.  It becomes a kind of consumer base to a taxpayer.  That is a different relationship and requires different scrutiny.<\/p><p>  With that in mind, there is much focus on salaries and so on.  I would prefer to look at value for money, where the money goes and how it is spent.  Does the consumer-taxpayer, or something similar to a taxpayer, get value for money and what they require from RTE?<\/p><p>  We have listened to the testimony about many of the reductions which have taken place and they are quite severe.  That is accepted.  In terms of the reduction in staff numbers, how many staff were full-time, part-time and on contract?  Were there any compulsory redundancies?  If there was not, are compulsory redundancies an option for management?  On the payroll costs, relative to total costs, the presentation mentioned &euro;153 million out of &euro;353 million.  How does that compare with similar broadcasters in terms of the ratio of payroll to other costs?  <\/p><p>  The witnesses said they were working in a very challenging commercial environment in regard to advertising.  Has RTE reduced advertising rates?  I am not sure how it charges for advertising, whether it is per minute or per second.<\/p><p>  I have some concerns about the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  When people come up with a report and say it is broadly positive, people say: \"Well they would say that\".  RTE has spent quite a lot of time advertising RTE in respect of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  Has there been a cost evaluation of that element of advertising?  I do not want to get into a debate on whether that is good or bad.  If it was a corporate decision taken by RTE, what is the value of that?  <\/p><p>  The witnesses said there were 5,000 hours of home produced broadcasting, which is a huge amount and which is what we are talking about here in terms of what RTE does.  Has there been any assessment carried out on the price per hour that cost?  If there has been, how do we compare internationally, if there are comparisons?  I accept the point made about figures from other commercial stations but do we have figures for international comparisons?<\/p><p>  To touch on the top ten salaries, I note there have been significant reductions in many of the contracts of some of the employees who are in this top ten.  Have there been variations in their responsibilities?  Are they doing more for less, less for less or significantly more for less?  As public representatives, we spend a lot of time in our cars and we listen to RTE radio, in particular current affairs programmes.  Some of the presenters or personalities who do not appear in the top ten are extremely capable and are very entertaining and competent.  I would suggest that, in many cases, they are better ambassadors for RTE.  It would not be the worst thing in the world to take a greater punt on those personalities who do not feature in the top ten.  They are quite effective when it comes to incisive broadcasting or entertaining broadcasting, in particular.<\/p><p>  I get exasperated when I see chat show hosts interviewing chat show hosts.  It is a bit of a merry-go-round between organisations.  One of the best interviews was done with a young man from Blennerville, Mr. Donal Walsh, who sadly passed away.  That was a particularly challenging piece of work and I thought it was public service at its best.  I would like to see more of that type of work, the launch of RTE junior and the work with the RTE archives rather than who is in Dublin with the next book deal or the next film, although I know that needs to be done.  Challenging the audience is broadcasting at its very best and it is what RTE does best.<\/p> <p>If I was asked, I would like to see much more of this rather than Michael Parkinson or Graham Norton again on RTE.  Perhaps I am cynical about it, but what RTE does best is the type of interview Mr. O'Connor did with Mr. Donal Walsh.

I have always given great praise to RTE, but I have never been able to understand the obscene wage structure for those at the top.  In the past we were told advertising paid for many of the top earners, but their earnings should have been related to the size of population or audience as much as anything else.  Ireland is a small country of 4.5 million people, compared to a population of 60 million in Britain and it is beyond belief there is a mindset that we can have broadcasters with the same wage structures as those in Britain.  How many of the top earners have different wages for working on radio and television?  Is this right?  Ms O'Keeffe has said the average salary was &euro;300,000, but if people are double jobbing, is this taken into account in the calculation?  Are their taxes paid directly by RTE or do they use companies to avail of tax breaks?  I do not know whether that is true, but I keep hearing it is the case.  I am not even sure whether I should ask the question, but it has been said many times that they do not pay the same taxes as everyone else while taking home massive earnings.<\/p><p>  RTE's revenue is down by more than &euro;100 million.  Is there a critical mass of staff?  Is there a cut-off point for staff reductions?  I acknowledge the organisation has reduced staff numbers substantially during the years, but is the point approaching at which no more can be cut?<\/p><p>  With regard to advertising, there is an ongoing debate about whether alcohol advertisements should be permitted.  Does Mr. Curran have a view on this?  Does he believe that in an ideal world such advertisements should not be broadcast?  Would this cost the station substantially?<\/p><p>  I enjoy many of the home produced programmes.  Are they much cheaper to make than buying programmes on the open market or do they cost a great deal more?<\/p><p>  How many legal actions are lodged against RTE annually?

Can RTE learn lessons from the way that station manages its budget without a subvention of any description?<\/p><p>  Mr. Curran has stated that, as the staff and wage reductions kick in, RTE will begin to generate a profit and that the deficit of &euro;60 million will reduce.

He is correct that it is not a question of cuts alone.  One should assess value for money in terms of how effective they are and one way to do this is to look at the transmitted hour cost or the cost of programming.  While it is difficult to compare programmes, as one programme is not the same as another, we have shown significant reductions in our per transmitted hour cost.  For example, the average cost per transmitted hour for RTE One decreased by 29% between 2008 and 2012, while the figure for RTE Two decreased by 21%.  The number of transmitted hours has not decreased hugely.  Similarly, in the case of radio, the average cost per transmitted hour across all services has decreased significantly - for Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta by18%; Lyric FM, 20%; 2FM, 24%; and Radio 1, 24%.  As well as maintaining output, we have tried to consistently reduce year on year the transmitted hour cost.<\/p><p>  Deputies Noel Harrington and Dessie Ellis referred to the cost of indigenous programming which is significantly higher than that of acquired programming because of the level of production involved.

We have tried to do this.  We have engaged with European broadcasters in benchmarking costs per hour.  We have had a number of those and always get into difficulties in terms of how somebody accounts for something, the different methods of costing, etc.  It can, therefore, be difficult to compare with our European counterparts.  Drama is one area in which costs are similar.  One might argue about the quality of drama and which is better or worse, but we have compared ourselves with the BBC.  For example, \"Eastenders\" costs more than double what it costs to produce \"Fair City\", while \"Casualty\", another well known drama in the United Kingdom, costs between four and five times more.  While they have different audiences, they are similar soap dramas.  That is not necessarily a consistent factor across the board, but it is one comparison at which we have looked.<\/p><p>  We  have also benchmarked the resources we put into our programmes against those put in by our European counterparts, including the number of hours of research involved, editing and so on.  Both RTE and the independent sector compare favourably with them.  We show levels of efficiency that compare well.  Another comparison in the context of value for money and efficiency involves head count.  Is a 21% reduction enough?  For example, the head count in Danmarks Radio and YLE in Finland is considerably higher than that for RTE.

What was the purpose of the PricewaterhouseCoppers involvement because at this stage it crops up virtually every time we switch on the radio or television.  There was reference to how it benefits the economy.  I presume that means that the money people gave to RTE benefited the economy and that it includes the licence fee.  It is rather like a Deputy commissioning a report on what amount of money he or she contributes to the local economy from his or her wages and expenses and putting it up as a plus as to why people should vote for him or her.  That would be ridiculous.  It is actually the people's money that is being used to tell to us how great is RTE.  Would it not have made more sense to leave the slots free for health promotion or getting people into sport?  What is so important about this that RTE has to tell us all it is contributing to the economy with our money?<\/p><p>  In regard to the pay of some of its presenters, a Deputy said that people are very good at having a go at us in regard to our pay.  By God, they are right because we get paid far too much.  That does not exclude us from asking why, say, Marian Finucane, according to the latest figures available to me for 2011, receives &euro;492,000 per year for bringing her friends around on a Saturday and Sunday morning on national radio.  The witnesses mentioned how important these people are from an advertising point of view and where would RTE be without them.  Where would Marian Finucane and Pat Kenny be without RTE?  It is a kind of symbiotic relationship.  Nobody would know who they are were it not for RTE.  When RTE decides their value, how does it come to conclusions?  Does it look at what people are paid in Radio Manchester?  I doubt if anybody is paid &euro;0.5 million for four hours work in Radio Manchester and, if so, I do not know how it could remain open for business.  How is the pay calculated for these people?<\/p><p>  An excellent point was made by the Deputy on my left about the fact that RTE has new presenters who do not appear in the top ten.  It is refreshing to hear new people on RTE Radio because it is like groundhog day at this stage.  For how many decades do we need to hear these people who bring their own personal opinions to the airwaves?  It is time they were moved on and that RTE used some of its talent that does not seem to cost a fortune.  If it did, they would appear in the top ten.<\/p><p>  RTE does a good job in certain ways.  It would want to as it gets enough money.  It would want to do something good.  It is inevitable that it does something good.  I admit RTE has improved from the days when it started in the evening with \"Upstairs Downstairs\" and closed at 11 p.m.  That is an improvement but many more improvements could be made.  From the point of view of value for money for presenters, if in the morning RTE was to say to Marianne Finucane that it would give her &euro;100,000-----  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013052200016#P01100","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1369218900,"counter":748,"content":"<p>Excuse me, Deputy I would prefer if you did not mention names.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013052200016#P01200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1369218900,"counter":749,"content":"<p>Fair enough.

I cannot see anybody taking them on board and if somebody did, so be it.<\/p><p>  With regard to how RTE employs these people  through companies, is that its way of getting them at a cheaper rate as it does not have to pay them pensions and so on?

When we are asked about this aspect, much of the discussion is around the highest paid earners but we have a host of people who are not in the top ten who offer amazing value and to whom the public respond incredibly positively.  They do an amazing job.  I accept the point the Deputy made and I am glad he made it, namely, it is noticeable that we are bringing more of those people through.  It is noticeable in radio and in news, in terms of initiatives Mr. Bakhurst has undertaken, and in television.  Any broadcaster needs that balance between experience and others.<\/p><p>  That answer would have been included in terms of what Ms O'Keeffe and Mr. Dalton said.

However, the only reason they are big cuts is because they were on huge money in the first place.  If they were on &euro;100,000 then a 30% cut would be a large cut.  Although 30% of &euro;400,000, &euro;500,000, &euro;600,000 or &euro;700,000 is, in percentage terms, a big cut, it still leaves them on ridiculous salaries.  It cannot be justified in a country with this population.  The idea that they are geniuses that cannot be replaced does not hold.  That is simply not the case.

Among other things that story is not going away.  We are keeping it under review.  As part of the process we have spoken to the BBC and other broadcasters about the potential of sharing premises.
