Indeed only yesterday, I met Jim Miley, the Project Director of The Gathering to explore ways in which we could work together on this initiative.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Cultural Institutions are promoting a number of initiatives specifically designed to contribute to the success of The Gathering. <\/p><p>- The <b>National Museum of Ireland<\/b>   is promoting its four sites as places where Gathering events from small family reunions up to big marquee events can take place, with special emphasis on the Museum of Country Life from a regional perspective.<\/p><p>- The <b>National Concert Hall<\/b>   will be presenting an extended range of concerts during the summer months, featuring the best of Irish artists across all musical genres.  <\/p><p>- The <b>Irish Museum of Modern Art<\/b>   is intensifying its efforts to attract overseas media coverage of its main exhibitions with a view to attracting more visitors to the country.  <\/p><p><b>- The National Gallery<\/b>   has arranged a programme of special lectures highlighting Irish and international artists, together with a series of study mornings featuring Turner, the Yeats Family and Modern Irish artists. <\/p><p>- The <b>Crawford Art Gallery<\/b>   will establish an American chapter of the Friends of the Crawford in 2013 to promote connections and visits to the Gallery. Linking with the Smithsonian Institute, the Crawford will offer an integrated package of cultural tours of Ireland, with a focus on Cork and Munster. <\/p><p>- The <b>National Archives<\/b>   will continue to provide a high quality service to family and local history researchers which will play a key role in The Gathering.<\/p><p>The <b>Arts Council<\/b> will play a key role in funding and developing arts events around the country during 2013. In addition to the music, dance, theatre, visual and other arts created with support from the Arts Council in every county in the State as part of its core role in funding the arts, the Council has also allocated special funding for the touring of works in 2013. This will ensure that more people right around the country &#8211; including, I hope, many of the thousands of visitors who will visit for The Gathering &#8211; can experience excellent performances and exhibitions locally.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, both the Culture Night and <i>International Celebration of Irish Culture<\/i>   initiatives will also make a significant contribution towards the success of The Gathering. The Culture Night initiative has grown into a significant national cultural event, with more than 300,000 people visiting museums, galleries and other across the country in 2011. The International Celebration of Irish Culture is a new initiative based around the St Patrick&#8217;s Day festival, which was well supported this year. Plans are already in hand to develop the concept further in 2013 with a key aim of using the existing St Patrick&#8217;s Festival activity to promote Ireland and its culture, both domestically and internationally. <\/p><p><br \/>  In the heritage area, I recently launched two new websites which aim to highlight lesser-known sites - national monuments and heritage buildings that are open to the public but which tend to be only visited by those very familiar with the particular area in which they are situated. It is hoped that the new <i>&#8216;Places to See&#8217;<\/i> and <i>&#8216;Monuments to Visit&#8217; <\/i>  websites will assist in encouraging tourists to visit locations that might not otherwise be on their itineraries and also assist those of us welcoming relatives and friends from abroad as part of The Gathering next year to be able to identify locations close by that will interest visitors.  Both websites feature easy-to-use digital maps that provide directions to the sites and details of what the visitor can expect to find on arrival.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, I am conscious that genealogy will be of particular interest in the context of The Gathering.  There is a wide range of genealogical material available in the country.  In relation to my Department and the agencies under my auspices, genealogical services are provided by the National Library of Ireland, the National Archives and through the website    operated by my Department.  My Department and the institutions are currently exploring what improvements could be made to our genealogical offering against the backdrop of The Gathering. That work is ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300062#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forbairt na Gaeilge","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300063#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[41976\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300063#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"cad at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige chun an togra L&iacute;ofa a chur i bhfeidhm sa St&aacute;t seo.","asker":"1083","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>Sheol an tAire N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, an tAire Cult&uacute;ir, Eala&iacute;on agus F&oacute;ill&iacute;ochta i dTuaisceart &Eacute;ireann, an togra <i>L&iacute;ofa 2015<\/i>   i Me&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair 2011 agus bh&iacute; an-&aacute;thas orm f&eacute;in a bheith i l&aacute;thair ar an &oacute;c&aacute;id sin.

Supporting education and providing access to information are also very important elements of the commemorative programme.

First, it has sought to reflect the timeline of historic events that commenced in April 1912 with the introduction to parliament at Westminster of the third Home Rule Bill.  The campaign on this Bill, and particularly the Unionist response in the expectation that it would be enacted, is of fundamental significance to many of the events that followed and particularly to the outcome at the end of the decade.  It is intended to continue to reflect the Home Rule debate in the coming year, including the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Irish Volunteers, along with the economic and social history reflected in the Dublin Lockout.  Second, alongside the current commemorative activity, the development of the commemorative programme for the coming years has been oriented towards consultation with interested parties and the development of links with official, institutional and community partners with a view to co-operative initiatives and complementary events.  A website is under development that will from the outset provide notice of forthcoming events and occasional reports on the continuing programme.  This site will develop as a space to feature information of relevant commemorative activities at home and abroad.  It will be of particular value to diaspora communities interested in the commemorative arrangements and especially those intending to arrange travel to Ireland.<\/p><p>  The developed public awareness of the Decade of Centenaries programme will also be assisted by the preparation of special materials and features by print and broadcast media.  Special supplements to newspapers and broadcasts of feature material on radio and television have been arranged to complement the general reportage of commemorations.  I very much appreciate the interest of media organisations to consult on their planning of such special commemorative material to coincide with the anniversaries of key historic events.  In the coming years, the Decade of Centenaries programme will provide a unique platform for the promotion of Ireland abroad and also provide special opportunities to attract inward tourism.  All members of the Government will be supporting the programme with a view to achieving its full potential.  I believe strongly that the history of the revolutionary period is the shared heritage of all of us.

Unfortunately, the unauthorised turf-cutting that was undertaken by a minority of contractors and turf-cutters this year has diverted limited resources into enforcement activities and added additional complexity to the process of completing the plan.<\/p><p><br \/>  Nonetheless, I am determined that, in collaboration with the Peatlands Council, substantial progress will be made on the plan over the coming year. In this regard, my Department will now be stepping up contact with turf-cutting groups to seek long-term resolutions to the issues for their particular bogs, in compliance with EU and national law. <\/p><p><br \/>  The TCCA has suspended engagement with the Government and with the Peatlands Council, which is regrettable. However, the vast majority of turf-cutters in these sites have engaged with the Government and applied for its flexible package of compensation or relocation. Those who choose to cease cutting turf completely can apply for compensation of &#8364;1,500 per annum for the next 15 years. Eligible cutters are also entitled to a one-off payment of &#8364;500 for this year. This means the total compensation package is worth &#8364;23,000, index linked and tax-free.<\/p><p><br \/>  For those who wish to continue cutting, my Department is working to relocate turf cutters to alternative, undesignated bogs. Preparations have been finalised on the first of these relocation bogs and others are being finalised, or solutions are being identified, in consultation with affected cutters. Where relocation bogs are not yet available, turf-cutters can choose between a &#8364;1,500 payment, or the delivery of 15 tonnes of turf, each year while the relocation bog is being identified, acquired and prepared for cutting. They will also be entitled to the one-off &#8364;500 payment. <\/p><p>To date, almost 2,400 applications for compensation or relocation have been received by my Department, with payments issued already to some 1,461<b><i><\/i><\/b>  applicants.  Turf deliveries have been made to 58 applicants and a further 146 are approved for delivery. Some 701 applicants have indicated an interest in relocation.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am maintaining regular contact with the European Commission and am working closely with them to address this difficult issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300065#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":61,"content":"<p>Question No. 29 answered with Question No. 18.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Elections","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300065#WRD01175"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[41771\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300065#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute; na pleananna at&aacute; aige chun &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta nua a cheapadh; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1040","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[41967\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300065#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas maidir le hionadaithe nua &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta; agus maidir leis na daoine a roghna&iacute;tear mar ionadaithe &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, an g&aacute; d&oacute;ibh bheith ina gComhairleoir&iacute; Contae.","asker":"1066","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>T&oacute;gfaidh m&eacute; Ceisteanna Uimhreacha 30 agus 38 le ch&eacute;ile.<\/p><p><br \/>  Faoi Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, ceapfaidh an tAire Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta seachtar comhalta, an cathaoirleach san &aacute;ireamh, ar bhord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus ainmneoidh Comhairl&iacute; Contae a bhfuil ceantar Gaeltachta ina ndl&iacute;nse, c&uacute;igear comhalta eile le bheith ceaptha ag an Aire.

The report, commissioned by the Heritage Council and prepared under the direction of a steering committee chaired by my Department, provides comprehensive evidence-based data that supports and enhances our innate understanding of the importance of our built heritage. <\/p><p><br \/>  The report indicates that capital investment in built heritage conservation provides significant employment in the construction industry, while also assisting in developing and maintaining specialised skills among conservation professionals and craftspeople. While the management and delivery of specific State-funded conservation projects is generally carried out through bodies such as the OPW, local authorities and heritage organisations that receive grants awarded by the Heritage Council or my Department, the report identifies that much of the investment in our built heritage comes from private sources, and not the State.  In this context, it is not possible to quantify the number of heritage or restoration projects currently in progress or proposed throughout the country. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department remains focused on working creatively across Government and with partner bodies, such as the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Rural Development Programme (formerly LEADER) and other heritage interests, in seeking to ensure that resources are directed towards the heritage sector.  <\/p><p>In this context, my Department is currently promoting the role which Ireland&#8217;s heritage has to play in making our country an attractive destination for sustainable tourism and inward investment, both in terms of the operation of Ireland&#8217;s national parks and nature reserves, and in terms of our unique built heritage.  Culture and heritage are important elements of Ireland&#8217;s tourism product, and heritage properties, including those in State care, are prominent tourism sites.  At the National Ploughing Championship in Wexford last week, I formally launched new elements of my Department&#8217;s websites, <i><\/i>and<i><\/i><i>,<\/i> which will guide visitors to a selection of our national monuments and structures of architectural heritage interest. <\/p><p>My Department and OPW, which is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of monuments in State ownership or guardianship, is also actively assisting F&aacute;ilte Ireland (which is the key driver in relation to heritage tourism) with various initiatives to promote heritage tourism.  <\/p><p><br \/>  With specific regard to ringforts, my Department has identified 32 of the 757 national monuments sites in my ownership or guardianship as ringforts.  There are 120,000 further monuments, mostly located on private lands, including many ringforts, that are protected under the National Monuments Acts.  Given the total number of these sites, it is not feasible to say specifically what the situation is in relation to access for each site nationally, However, national monument sites are, in general, freely accessible to the public, or where privately held, accessible under local arrangements.  While some monuments acquired in the past do not have a public right of way, it is my Department&#8217;s policy to acquire such rights, where possible, with the agreement of landowners, and this practice will continue.<\/p><p><br \/>  It should also be noted that my Department does not have comprehensive information on the numbers of reports of actual damage or threats of damage to protected structures and sites but it does have a suite of tools, both legislative and advisory, at its disposal to address such reports, where and when they are received. <\/p><p><br \/>  As Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I am committed to developing initiatives which contribute to the appropriate re-use of our built heritage assets and maximising this resource as a platform to promote and raise awareness of our cultural heritage in our historic towns and cities.  In this regard, my Department is currently engaged in developing a specific heritage-led Historic Towns Initiative in collaboration with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Heritage Council.  My primary objective with this initiative is to ensure that the participating towns have access to, and an understanding of, appropriate guidance to assist them in best conserving their heritage assets and, in so doing, underpin the sustainability of their community and local economy.  It is my hope that meeting these goals will also, by extension, significantly enhance the visitor experience in these towns, thus helping to maximise the potential positive contribution of tourism to each of these towns and their respective hinterlands.  I expect that this initiative, once fully developed this year, will be piloted in 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  While funding for investment in heritage is particularly limited at present, my Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, in so far as resources allow, in accordance with best practice and legal requirements, both nationally and internationally, and will intervene as provided by law to protect such sites.  In June for example, I approved offers of funding to 41 conservation projects in 27 local authority areas to a total value of &#8364;500,000 under the Structures at Risk Fund of my Department's 2012 Built Heritage Capital Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300067#WRF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300067#WRF01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Programmes","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300067#WRF01150"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[42126\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300067#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will comment on the de-facto upgrade of the EU-Israel Association Agreement strengthening trade relations between the two.","asker":"1001","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":106,"content":"<p>The Deputy may be referring to some misleading media reports following the meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council on 24 July.   In June 2009, at the urging of Ireland and other partners, the EU Foreign Affairs Council decided not to proceed at that time with an &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; in EU-Israel relations which had been agreed in principle the previous year.  This &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; referred to a stepping-up of political-level contacts between the EU and Israel.  The then Minister for Foreign Affairs made very clear in the D&aacute;il that it was accepted by Ireland and others that the freezing of the &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; did not include the continued normal development of routine technical cooperation with Israel under the EU-Israel Association Agreement.  It was made clear also that, had this not been accepted, other partners would not have agreed to put the &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; on hold.<\/p><p>  This type of routine cooperation, which the EU seeks to advance with all of its neighbours, involves technical cooperation to align administrative systems more closely (generally in terms of the other country adopting EU norms and standards), and removing barriers to trade, movement of persons etc.  It is an intrinsic objective of the EU, for the mutual benefit of both sides, and is not intended as a reward for good conduct on the part of the other party. Similar Association Agreements are in place between the EU and most of its immediate neighbours.  Action Plans under the Agreements, setting out details of cooperation, are routinely renewed and updated as progress unfolds.<\/p><p>  Pending the negotiation of a new full-scale Action Plan with Israel to cover such areas of technical cooperation, the European Commission had for almost two years been discussing with Israel the areas where further cooperation might be advanced within the framework of the existing Association Agreement.  The Association Council on 24 July simply agreed the list of such areas of possible cooperation, as it emerged from these official-level talks.  It should also be noted that what was agreed in July was a list of areas where cooperation can be explored and advanced, not a set of actual agreements and measures.<\/p><p>  The proposed &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; frozen in 2009 remains frozen. What was agreed in July 2012 was not covered by the 2009 decision and is entirely within the scope of the existing Association Agreement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300067#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300068#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[42171\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300068#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will ensure that Ireland meets its commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national product on overseas aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1027","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme prioritises the fight against global poverty and hunger.

Rental income of companies is returned as net of interest on borrowings the figures for interest are not separately distinguished in corporate tax returns.

Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%. This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum. No USC is chargeable. Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess. These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums.    Based on certain assumptions the average annual industrial wage is estimated at about &euro;31,000 in 2011. As there is no general requirement for data on retirement lump sums of less than &euro;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &euro;200,000 to &euro;31,000. Furthermore, details of the marginal rate of income tax an individual would pay on a taxable lump sum pension payment in the scenario outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question are not available.<\/p><p>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the savings involved, it is estimated that just over 268,000 individuals in the public service would be on salaries of over &euro;20,750 and less than &euro;133,500 which, under existing pension scheme arrangements generally applying across the public service, would deliver retirement lump sums of between &euro;31,000 and &euro;200,000. If it is assumed that these individuals would retire in line with retirement trends from the public service in a normal year (about 2.5%), then the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums in excess of &euro;31,000 at 20% could be approximately &euro;100 million in a full year. In this example the additional tax yield from taxing lump sum payments in excess of &euro;31,000 at 41% could be approximately &euro;200 million.<\/p><p>  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector. I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. This option is not available to members of public sector schemes. Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300070#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Avoidance Issues","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300070#WRJ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[42333\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300070#WRJ00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will confirm that Section 77 Finance Act (2011) (No 6 of 2011) relating to taxpayer confidentiality, was included following lobbying from the International Financial Services Centre; his views on whether this privacy provision will obstruct necessary oversight of multinational company tax evasion strategies; if he will confirm that this clause does not prevent a case specific application for access to data held by the Revenue Commissioners by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement or Criminal Assets Bureau.","asker":"1015","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>The provisions of Section 77 of the Finance Act 2011 (No 6 of 2011) were proposed by the Revenue Commissioners to my Department and, following consideration by my Department and the Government, were accepted for inclusion in the Finance Bill. The purpose of the provision is to provide a firm legislative basis to the long-standing practice relating to the confidentiality of taxpayer information, both commercial and personal, held by Revenue.  It was not introduced as a result of lobbying by either the International Financial Services Centre or any other party.    Modern tax administration depends to a large extent on achieving a high level of voluntary compliance by taxpayers, and that in turn depends on a relationship of trust and openness between the taxpayer and Revenue in relation to information that is invariably private and, in the case of businesses, often commercially sensitive.  That trust and openness can be undermined in the absence of clear statutory protections. In this regard Section 77 provides that taxpayer information may not be disclosed to third parties except in the circumstances specified in Section 77 or where it is expressly authorised by another enactment.<\/p><p>  Before this provision was enacted, taxpayers relied on the protections in the Official Secrets Act, the Data Protection Acts and the statutory declaration made by Revenue officials in respect of income tax and corporation tax under Schedule D.  In the absence of a specific legislative confidentiality provision, the Information Commissioner has commented that to a large extent it seemed that the basis for taxpayer confidentiality was Revenue&rsquo;s equitable duty of confidence rather than a clear statutory entitlement, which was a matter of concern to the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners, being highly conscious of the importance of the protection of citizens&rsquo; rights in this area, were rightly concerned to ensure that Ireland is in a position to ensure taxpayer confidentiality to the same extent as other jurisdictions.  Many other tax administrations have statutory taxpayer confidentiality provisions in place.  <\/p><p>  Any impression that might be given that Ireland lacked a strong legislative basis for assuring confidentiality for taxpayer information could have adverse implications for the confidence that taxpayers (including foreign direct investors) have in the ability of the Irish tax system to maintain the required level of confidentiality for sensitive personal and commercial information. <\/p><p>  Section 77 does not prevent case specific applications for access to data held by the Revenue Commissioners from being made available to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement or the Criminal Assets Bureau for the purposes of the investigation by either of these bodies of a suspected criminal offence. In this regard the taxpayer confidentiality legislation not only sets out particular circumstances in which Revenue may disclose information but also contains provisions that enable the disclosure of information where other statutory provisions provide for this. <\/p><p>  Section 77 will not obstruct necessary oversight of multinational companies or any other relevant entities. Indeed it complements other statutory provisions enabling information to be exchanged with our Double Taxation Agreement or Tax Information Exchange Agreement partners - which is vitally important to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation in the international tax arena.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300070#WRJ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300070#WRJ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[42351\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300070#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax relief for approved retirement funds in respect of earners if more than &euro;80,000 and for earners more than &euro;100,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) are personal investment accounts established with retirement benefit funds as an alternative to the purchase of an annuity.

A qualifying patent was a patent in relation to which the research, planning and development work leading to the patented invention was carried out in the State or in another country that is part of the European Economic Area.

First, after some disappointing European and global data in the first half of 2012, the uplift in global and European confidence should lead to higher demand for Irish exports, which are driving our recovery.  Second, a sustained reduction in borrowing costs for the sovereign should eventually filter through to the rest of the economy.  Of course, Ireland has taken important measures in order to regain market confidence.  Continuation along this path will be important for markets to continue to be reassured about Ireland's prospects.  So, Ireland has already benefitted from important measures taken since June 29 and we expect further improvements as measures continue to be taken at the Member State, including in Ireland, and European levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300070#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300071#WRK00075"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[42354\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300071#WRK00100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide the latest figures on income tax in tabular form in bands of &euro;10,000 ranging from &euro;0 to &euro;5 million; the gross income in each band; the numbers in each band; the percentage of total numbers in each band; the average income in each band; the income tax paid in each band; the universal social charge paid in each band; the PRSI paid in each band; the total tax including USC and PRSI paid in each band; the total income after all taxes paid in each band; the average income after all tax is paid in each band and the effective tax rate after all taxes, including USC and PRSI, as a percentage of income paid in each band.","asker":"1003","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":176,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the most detailed relevant information that can be readily provided at this time in terms of the income distribution and tax liabilities of income earners is estimated by reference to the income tax year 2012, and is set in the following table.

Generally speaking, I share PM Monti's view that the problems besetting the euro area are solvable and that cohesive action can reduce the cost for all.  The market reactions to the June 29 HoGS statement clearly show that markets believe this also.  During their meeting in Rome, both the Taoiseach and PM Monti stressed the need for rapid implementation of the Council's decisions of June 28 and 29.  As you know, I also support these agreements and their rapid implementation.  Notably, PM Monti is openly supportive of relief measures for Ireland, as also reiterated during that meeting in Rome.  Of course, I also consider it particularly important that the agreement on this proposal is suitably delivered on.<\/p><p>  PM Monti has repeatedly proposed a greater role for the ECB, as have I.  Given the positive reaction of markets to announcements by ECB President Draghi that culminated in Outright Monetary Transactions, I think it is also clear that these views are shared elsewhere.  Notably, PM Monti has argued that, far from undermining discipline in vulnerable countries, such measures, with appropriate conditionality, would facilitate the difficult structural changes required in vulnerable countries.  It is, therefore, also necessary for Member States to re-establish mutual trust, as PM Monti has outlined.  So, in summary, there are many views held by PM Monti that I am broadly supportive of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300071#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Banking Sector","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300071#WRK00450"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[33231\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300071#WRK00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the timeframe he believes the process will take at EU level before a decision is taken on shared liability in relation to bank debt; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>In their statement made following their meeting on 29th June 2012, the Euro Area Heads of State or Government said that \"it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns\".

One of these building blocks is an integrated financial framework or banking union which comprises three elements: (a) an integrated system for the supervision of cross-border banks; (b) a European deposit insurance scheme; and (c) a European resolution scheme. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Euro Area Summit also on 29 June called on the Commission to quickly present proposals for the setting up of a single supervisory mechanism which would be considered by the Council as a matter of urgency.  Significantly, the statement of the Euro area Summit clearly stated that when such a mechanism is in place for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalise banks directly.<b><\/b> The statement also committed the Eurogroup to examining the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to further improving the sustainability of our well-performing adjustment programme.  The Commission presented legislative proposals in September for a single supervisory mechanism conferring powers on the ECB for the supervision of all banks in the euro area, with a mechanism for non-euro countries to join on a voluntary basis.  The Commission called on the Council and European Parliament to adopt the legislative proposal by the end of 2012.  While the timetable is ambitious we will be supporting efforts by the European Council to meet this target. <\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland supports in principle the development of a banking union for Europe.  Our support for a single supervisor is contingent on such a system definitively breaking the link between the sovereign and the banking sector.  We are also seeking to ensure that shared supervision is progressed as part of a package which will also address shared risk and mutualisation of debt.  The question of retrospective application of ESM remains firmly on the table as far as Ireland is concerned and we would expect to see more detail on how this can be addressed over the coming months.  Any move to a banking union must respect the integrity of the single market and be consistent with the principle of free movement of capital throughout the European Union.<\/p><p><br \/>  I do not propose at this stage to commission an analysis of the proposal.  My officials are working closely with the Central Bank in relation to our position on the details of the shared supervisory mechanism proposal and will also be consulting with industry stakeholders.

This involves action by Member States and at EU level in order to boost growth, investment and employment.  Measures to be implemented at national level include the full implementation of the country-specific recommendations from the European Semester as well as pursuing differentiated growth-friendly fiscal consolidation.  From an Irish perspective, I want to assure the Deputy that the required consolidation over the next few years will be pursued in as growth-friendly a manner as possible.  A number of measures are to be implemented at EU level in order to boost growth, and I believe the cumulative impact of all of these measures will have a positive impact in terms of supporting economic activity in the EU at this difficult juncture.  This, in turn, can be expected to benefit Ireland, given the importance of the EU as a trading partner.<\/p><p>  At EU level, the measures announced include a deepening of the Single Market and reducing the regulatory burden.  Another important measure is the mobilisation of EUR120 billion - about 1 per cent of EU gross national income - to boost European growth.  These funds will be made available via EU structural funds, the Project Bonds initiative, and EIB lending.  We continue to make progress in terms of maximising the amount of funding that can be made available to Ireland in these regards.  Constituting part of these efforts is a EUR10 billion paid-in capital increase for the European Investment Bank, which increases the lending capacity of the Bank by about one-third.  This is of particular interest to Ireland because the Bank has been an important source of funding.  Funds received in the past already have been substantial, covering commercial semi-states, local authorities, road projects (PPPs) and loans to banks for on-lending to SMEs.  The Exchequer can also borrow directly from the EIB in respect of capital projects such as school-building.  For instance, a EUR 100m loan was agreed with the EIB for the purpose of building 550 classrooms across Ireland on July 6.  Other examples of projects currently under appraisal include funding up to EUR 200m for the improvement of water infrastructure and funding up to EUR 200m for use in SME and mid-cap investment via AIB.<\/p><p>  Further, on July 6th, EIB President Werner Hoyer visited Dublin and met with myself and Minister Howlin in order to discuss how Ireland can best work together with the EIB, notably developing flexible and innovative funding solutions to invest in infrastructure and key sectors of the economy.  We had very constructive discussion and remain actively and constructively engaged with the EIB on these and related matters, including at the time of the informal Ecofin in Nicosia mid-September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300071#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Summits","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300071#WRK01650"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[33664\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300071#WRK01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress that continues to be made arising from and in the wake of the recent EU summit with particular reference to the various issues identified as being fundamental to future fiscal and economic stability throughout the Eurozone and the EU in general; when he expects to be in a position to avail of any benefits accruing from this country&rsquo;s perspective; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, on June 28 and 29 Heads of State and Government confirmed their commitment to ensuring the integrity of the euro area and agreed on important general principles for achieving this, notably by breaking the link between sovereigns and banks.  The ensuing positive market reaction would indicate that these agreements were perceived as substantial.  Furthermore, important steps have since been taken and continue to be taken at the European and Member State level.  Since then, Ireland's spreads have reduced considerably.  This indicates that Ireland has already benefitted from these measures, with markets appearing to take heart, in particular, over commitments to specifically further improve the sustainability of Irish debt under its well-performing programme.<\/p><p>  With President Draghi's August announcement that the ECB stands ready to do whatever it takes within its mandate and the Outright Monetary Transactions announcement last month, the ECB has played an important role in further boosting market confidence.  A marked improvement for Irish spreads ensued and, with opportune timing, Ireland successfully returned to long-term capital markets at this time.  This confluence further underlines the credibility of Irish debt sustainability and the relevance for Ireland of the measures taken since June 29.<\/p><p>  Finally, let me mention that the general improvement of market sentiment and return of confidence is crucial from an Irish perspective.  First, after some disappointing European and global data in the first half of 2012, the uplift in global and European confidence should lead to higher demand for Irish exports, which are driving our recovery.  Second, a sustained reduction in borrowing costs for the sovereign should eventually filter through to the rest of the economy.  Of course, Ireland has taken important measures in order to regain market confidence.  Continuation along this path will be important for markets to continue to be reassured about Ireland's prospects.  So, Ireland has already benefitted from important measures taken since June 29 and we expect further improvements as measures continue to be taken at the Member State, including in Ireland, and European levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300071#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300072#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[34245\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300072#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of new lending, excluding rescheduling of loans and overdrafts, advanced by banks to small and medium enterprises since he instructed &euro;3.5 billion per annum to be advanced to them by each of the two pillar banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":202,"content":"<p>The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.

However, as Deputies will be aware, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has been availing of the gradual fall in the yield on Irish Government bonds over recent months to issue new debt and new types of debt instruments as part of our programme of rebuilding a presence in the markets with a view to ensuring that Ireland is able to fund itself as the EU\/IMF Programme draws to a close in 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300073#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300073#WRM00750"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[39023\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300073#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has received a copy of the study from the Central Bank of Ireland on lending and access to credit to small and medium businesses across the EU which concludes that Irish small and medium enterprises have the highest rejection rate from banks; the actions he will take following the reports findings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>I presume the Deputy is referring to Volume 2012, No.8 of the Economic Letter Series published by the Central Bank on 22 August last, entitled &#8220;<i>Irish SME credit supply and demand: comparisons across surveys and countries<\/i>.&#8221; I welcome all analysis in this key area which is used to inform all stakeholders. However, the Deputy should note that the Economic Letter contains a footnote stating that the views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the Central Bank of Ireland or the ESCB.   The figures published in the report are based upon previously published data and I should point out that they show that Ireland has the second highest rejection rate rather than the highest as stated by the Deputy. While this rejection rate is obviously a concern, I feel that it is important not to always focus on the worst aspect of such reports. Business confidence is crucial in the restoration of the credit market and the continued negative narrative is unhelpful. The report also found that there was a slight improvement in the rejection rates compared with the previous survey. <\/p><p><br \/>  The findings of the Mazars survey commissioned by my Department and other independent surveys, such as the SAFE survey, are used by the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office to inform discussions with banks on this key area of the Irish economy and that the pillar banks, in particular adhere to their lending commitments under the recapitalisation agreements. Robust discussions have taken place between the Department, the Credit Review Office and the banks to ensure that the banks are lending into the real economy. In addition, the Government, through the EMC, continue to meet with the banks on a regular basis to underscore the requirement to have credit available to viable SMEs to facilitate and support the recovery of the economy. <\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of rejection rates from banks in general, I would remind the Deputy that the Credit Review Office (CRO) can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities (including applications for restructured credit facilities) from &#8364;1,000 up to &#8364;500,000.

However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed. I remain open to any constructive suggestions which could augment the Government&#8217;s initiatives in this area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300073#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300073#WRM00950"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[38966\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300073#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on any recent discussions with Troika officials.","asker":"954","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":231,"content":"<p>There is a good and professional relationship with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF (The Troika) at all levels and this is reflected in the reports that are published after each Review.

It is estimated that it will take between 18 to 24 months to actually establish this new institution and may be 2015 before it actually distributes any loans.  There is also at present a lack of detail about both whether the initial government support for this initiative is a once-off provision or not and also the manner in which this new venture will seek to attract private investment.   Here, as the Deputy may be aware, the Government has introduced a number of parallel initiatives to facilitate and ensure the flow of credit to viable small businesses. It announced the establishment of the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) in September 2011. The SIF will channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in the Irish economy, following appropriate legislative changes to the investment policy of the NPRF.

Both banks achieved their 2011 targets.<\/p><p><br \/>  The independent Credit Review Office (CRO), as part of its remit, monitors the banks&#8217; progress in relation to the targets and reports on a quarterly basis in this regard.

This requires those countries to write to the Commission asking it to produce a formal proposal for such a directive.

A &quot;qualifying party&quot; is defined in the Party Leaders Allowance Act as a political party registered in the Register of Political Parties which contested the last general election or any subsequent by-elections and which had at least one member elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or elected or nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann at that general election or at any subsequent by-election.

Such qualifying Independent TDs are entitled to an annual rate of &euro;41,152. A similar provision in the Act provides for an annual payment of &euro;23,383 for Independent Senators.  The methodology used for calculation of the Party Leaders allowance for each qualifying party, and the annual amounts payable, are set out in Appendix I.  The Act prescribes 11 different categories of expenditure, including research, which are regarded as expenses arising from parliamentary activities for the purposes of entitlement to the allowance. These are set out at Appendix II. The primary restriction in the Act on the use of the allowance is that it may not be used in respect of election expenses.<\/p><p>I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly in relation to reviewing the Allowance.  Any change proposed following that review will require primary legislation to be prepared.  Responsibility for the Electoral Acts is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Provision is made for two payments to be made to qualifying political parties under the Electoral Acts.  A qualifying party under these Acts is a party which is registered in the Register of Political Parties in accordance with Section 25 of the Electoral Act, 1992 as a party organised in the State to contest a D&aacute;il election, and whose candidates received not less than 2% of the total first preference votes obtained by all candidates at the most recent D&aacute;il general election.<\/p><p>Section 50 (c) (ii) (I) (a) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, provides for an annual sum of &euro;4.948 million to be shared among qualified political parties.

Section 50(c) (i) (a) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 provides for an annual payment in each period of 12 months to each qualified party of &euro;126,973.81.  Under section 18 of the 1997 Act, as amended by the 2001 Act, parties shall, subject to guidelines issued by the Standards in Public Office Commission, apply such payments to:<\/p><p>&ldquo;the general conduct and management of the party&rsquo;s affairs and the lawful pursuit by it of any of its objectives and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, to any or all of the following purposes, namely<\/p><p>(i) the general administration of the party,<\/p><p>(ii) research, education and training,<\/p><p>(iii) policy formulation, and<\/p><p>(iv) the co-ordination of the activities of the branches and members of the party.<\/p><p>Payments made to a qualified party under this Part shall be deemed to include provision in respect of expenditure by the party in relation to the promotion of participation by women and young persons in political activity.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Application of this funding to election expenses is not allowed.<\/p><p>The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012, which was recently enacted, will severely curtail corporate donations and cut the amounts that can be donated to political parties. The same legislation also includes provision that Political Parties that do not select at least 30% women candidates and at least 30% men candidates at the next General Election will face a cut of half of their State funding.   It also makes provision for decreases as well as increases in civil service pay to be applied to the funding provided under the Electoral Acts.   The methodology used for calculation of amounts payable under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 is set out in Appendix III.<\/p><p>Finally, additional supports to the activities of members of each House, including secretarial assistance, are provided directly to members of each House under the auspices of the Oireachtas Commission. Since 2004, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has been financed from the Central Fund. The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act is amended every three years to provide for Oireachtas funding allocation for the following three years. The legislation is also amended as necessary to update finance, staffing, and governance procedures. It is envisaged that amending legislation will be enacted before the end of 2012.

These procedures state that contracting firms including subcontractors must be compliant with all statutory legislation including Registered Employment Agreements when engaged on public works contract, thereby creating a level playing field for competing tenderers.<\/p><p>  The standard Public Works Contract between a Contractor and procuring authority requires the Contractor to undertake to ensure that the wage rates and other terms and conditions for all workers (including employees of sub-contractors) comply with relevant REAs.  There are two REAs in place for the construction industry; one of which deals specifically with pensions assurance and sick pay. The second REA deals with wages and other conditions of employment. Separately, there is also an REA in place for the electrical contracting industry covering all terms and conditions of employment in that sector, including pension and sick pay.<\/p><p>  Article 49 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, limits the restrictions that Member States may impose on the freedom to provide services within the Community. Member States may only lawfully establish limitations on this fundamental freedom if such limitations fall within the acceptable principles set out by the established case law of the European Court of Justice. In recognition of the potential conflict between the exercise of the freedom to provide services throughout the Community and appropriate protection of the rights of workers temporarily posted abroad, a Directive protecting the rights of posted workers within the EU was introduced in 1996 (Directive 96\/71\/EC). This Directive was transposed into Irish law via Section 20 of the Protection of Employees [Part-Time Work] Act 2001.<\/p><p>  Article 3 of this Directive requires a Member State to ensure that enterprises posting workers to its territory guarantee those workers the terms and conditions of employment which are universally applicable in that Member State (i.e. where the work is carried out).  In this context, Article 3.1 (c), which covers the minimum rates of pay, including overtime rates expressly stipulates that it &ldquo;does not apply to supplementary occupational retirement pension schemes&rdquo;.  Case law has determined that a national measure which obliges contractors in another Member State to apply to their employees terms and conditions which go beyond the mandatory rules in Directive 96\/71\/EC for minimum protection is incompatible with European law. <\/p><p>  Ireland is therefore required to recognise and comply with posted workers pension rights established in another Member State during the period of posting in Ireland and may not impose any further obligation that would be incompatible with European law.<\/p><p>  If an employer is aware of specific instances where public contracts have been awarded to firms that are not compliant with their legal entitlements under an REA, there are a number of ways in which the matter can be investigated:<\/p><p>- through the relevant public authority that awarded the contract in the first instance<\/p><p>- through the Labour Court, or<\/p><p>- directly with the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300076#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Site Visits","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300076#WRP01350"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[42249\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300076#WRP01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of Industrial Development Agency sponsored visits to Mullingar, Athlone and Longford on an annual basis since 2009; the number of those visits that ultimately led to a positive decision by the visiting industrialists to locate an industry in any of these areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>One of the main challenges that IDA encounters in encouraging investment into locations outside of the large urban centres is the desire of investors to locate in areas with large population bases, typically with populations in excess of 1 million people.

The State pension (transition) is paid to people aged 65 who have retired from work and who have the required number and class of social insurance contributions. State pension contributory (SPC) is paid at age 66 to those who meet the qualifying conditions. <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) thereby increasing State pension age for all to 66 years. The State pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. <\/p><p>  The standardisation of State pension age at 66 and the abolition of State pension (transition) removes the retirement condition associated with State pension (transition) which acts as an incentive to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment.    There is no retirement condition attached to the State pension (contributory) which is currently payable from age 66.<\/p><p>  There are no plans to change the date of implementation.<\/p><p>  At present, my Department is working with the relevant agencies of State who have a role to play in identifying and breaking down barriers to remaining in work past the age of 65.<\/p><p>  The continued participation of older people in the labour market must be encouraged and facilitated to meet the challenge of an ageing society.  Employees and employers need to be persuaded to change their attitudes to working longer.  In the workplace, employers should try to retain older employees and create working conditions which make working longer both attractive and possible for the older worker.  <\/p><p>  Opportunities for older people to participate in education, employment and other aspects of economic and social life must be maximised.<\/p><p>  Raising State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future.  There is an important and significant policy background to these changes which is that with increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  The fundamental principle involved here is that people need to participate in the workforce for longer and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.  <\/p><p>  An information campaign in relation to all of the changes has been underway since March 2012 and all information can be accessed at www.welfare.ie.  My Department also met with the relevant representative groups and information leaflets were disseminated to all relevant groups as part of the information campaign.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300078#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Assist Scheme Applications","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300078#WRR00850"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[42150\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300078#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision will be made in relation to a review of a decision in relation to an application for farm assist in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 17 July 2012.

All of these centres have had a contract with RIA in existence since before May, 2010 and have, in effect, been renewed since then.  No new centres have been opened by RIA since 2009, with the exception of the Staircase centre in Dublin, opened in May, 2012, which was effectively a 'swop' with the adjacent Horse and Carriage centre, in respect of which RIA had a contract with the same contractor.  In recent years, RIA has generally only offered contracts for a period of 12 months and, but for a small number of exceptions, the contracts for each of centres in the table below would have been renewed approximately twice since May 2010.<\/p><p>Relevant to this question is the fact that the number of persons requiring  RIA accommodation has been on a downward trend since 2009.  On 23 September 2009, there were 6,674 persons in RIA accommodation.  On the same date in 2012 there were 4,941 persons, a decline of 1,733 or 26%.  RIA continually adjusts its accommodation portfolio to match demand, either through reductions in capacity or straightforward closures.  In relation to the latter, RIA closed 7 centres in 2009, 8 in 2010, 7 in 2011 and 3 so far in 2012. Given the continuing decline in numbers needing RIA accommodation, it is likely that more centres will close in 2013.<\/p><p>As I have stated in answers to previous D&aacute;&iacute;l Questions, it is not possible to provide values for current contracts entered into by RIA. Although there are standard service obligations - food, accommodation, etc. - on each of the centres, the <i>per diem<\/i> rate paid in each case by RIA is based on an individually negotiated contract. The rates differ from one contract to another depending on the facilities available in the centres, the differing functions of some of the centres, the location of the centres, the length of the contracts and so on.  Negotiations take place with a number of commercial entities on an ongoing basis and RIA endeavours to achieve the best value for money in respect of each contract.  It is not in the interests of the taxpayer that details of current individual contracts are known to the public or to other parties who are, or may be in the future, engaged in negotiations with RIA. Therefore, details of <i>current<\/i>   contract rates are not provided. The policy is that the updating of the table of contracts will take place only at the end of January each year in respect of all financial information up to the end of December two years previously, e.g. at the end of January, 2012 the records are updated to end of December 2009.  This policy has been upheld by the Office of the Information Commissioner.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that published on RIA's website &ndash; www.ria.gov.ie   - are its Annual Reports for the years 2007 to 2011 inclusive. These reports include details of spending for those years, showing total payments for contracts in respect of State owned, commercial and self catering centres; for transport costs; for utility costs in State owned centres; and for miscellaneous payments.  In addition, RIA publishes statistics on a monthly basis and the Deputy will also be able to track the changes in the contracted capacities through this monthly statistical information that has been published since 2004.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy should note that the RIA procurement process was subject to scrutiny in the Value For Money (VFM) review in respect of spending by RIA on asylum seeker accommodation which was published in May, 2010. A copy of this review is in the Oireachtas Library and is also viewable on the RIA website: www.ria.gov.ie.  The Review acknowledges the unique challenges in this particular area of procurement, e.g. the unpredictability of demand, the requirement to disperse asylum seekers around the country, local opposition to the opening of new centres, children settled in schools and so on.  Among the recommendations of the VFM report was the introduction of a mix of &lsquo;contracts for capacity&rsquo; and &lsquo;contracts for availability and occupancy&rsquo; as well as a 'more open' tendering system in respect of the commercially owned and operated centres in the RIA portfolio.<\/p><p>Preparatory work has begun on devising a more open tendering process for the commercially owned centres which could only have taken place following the recent completion of the tender competition for the management of RIA's seven State owned centres, which are identified in the table below. This will be a difficult exercise as the tender process will have to take account of &quot;non-money&quot; issues such as access to social, educational and health services as well as adherence to long standing Government policy on dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country so that no one region is disproportionately burdened in relation to service provision, as well as a recognition that other State agencies may have already committed resources in a particular region or area.<\/p><p><pcenter><b>RIA contracts as at 23 September 2012<\/b><\/pcenter><\/p><p><table><tr><th

Market conditions for Irish sheepmeat are generally proving more difficult in 2012 than in the previous two years. Factory prices for heavy lambs for the year 2012 to date are approximately 2% below 2011 levels for the corresponding period. This reflects the competitive pressures in the market.<\/p><p> I am aware that market conditions for light lamb are particularly difficult at the moment. There is a glut in the market due to weakened demand for Irish light lamb in the traditional markets in Spain and Italy, caused by the economic downturn in these regions. I understand that Spain is itself exporting higher quantities of light lamb to France at present and this trade is running approximately 30% above last year&#8217;s level.  Furthermore, these light lamb have traditionally being sold to the store trade, but this year trade has been poor as store lamb producers are reluctant to buy in large quantities on account of high meal costs.  <font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font><\/p><p><br \/>  There has been significant public investment in the sheep sector in recent years.  One of the main supports has been &#8364;54 million for the three-year Grassland Sheep Scheme which commenced in 2010.  The sheep fencing\/mobile handling equipment Scheme, one of five Targeted Agricultural Modernisations Schemes (TAMS) is also enabling many farmers in the sheep sector to complete the necessary investment works in order to maintain competitiveness and introduce increased efficiencies on the farm and so secure the future of their enterprises. Teagasc has also allocated almost &#8364;1.5 million for sheep research for 2012.  Bord Bia will spend over &#8364;1.1 million this year on a promotional strategy for the Irish sheep sector which addresses the issue of safeguarding the future of the sector in the following ways: by encouraging Irish consumers to buy more Quality Assured lamb; by collaborating with its French and English counterparts in a campaign to reverse the decline in consumption of lamb on the French market, which accounts for over 50% of our exports; by working with individual exporter to increase the amount of exports to higher value markets such as Germany and Scandinavia and thereby reduce Ireland&#8217;s dependency on the French market.<\/p><p><br \/>  On a positive note, sheepmeat exports to international markets almost doubled to 600 tonnes during the course of 2011. This generates a great confidence boost for Irish exporters.  While almost 99% of our lamb exports are to the EU, it is always beneficial to have a wide range of outlets available and to this end my Department, together with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to work to secure access to more third country outlets for Irish lamb. I announced the opening of the Singaporean and South African markets to Irish lamb over the summer. There is strong demand for all meats globally at present and my Department and I remain committed in our efforts to ensure that the Irish sheep sector is able to take full advantage of all of the opportunities that will arise as a result of this demand.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300088#WRBB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fur Farming","counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300088#WRBB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":506,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[42224\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100300088#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the review of fur farming; when a decision will be made on the report of the fur farming review group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":507,"content":"<p>   The Fur Farming Review Group submitted its report to my office.
