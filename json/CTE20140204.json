I thank them for inviting me to do so.<\/p><p>  The importance of investment in science, technology and innovation to Ireland's ongoing and future economic and social development and wellbeing has been well recognised by this and previous Governments.  Our focus has been very much on prioritising public investment in research while better exploiting results in order to lead to an acceleration of growth and job creation.<\/p><p>  Over the past decade we have expanded and consolidated our research and innovation system considerably and investment in research and innovation has grown substantially.  This investment has been based on an ambitious strategy of investing in people, infrastructure and associated facilities to build the science base across many areas of scientific research in both the higher education institutions and other public research organisations, notably through the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions, PRTLI, as well as Science Foundation Ireland and other research agencies.  This investment in scientific research is having many positive impacts, including powering an innovative and enterprising economy, creating high-value jobs, attracting, developing and nurturing business, scientists and talented people and ensuring Ireland is connected and respected internationally.<\/p><p>  We can draw much encouragement from the fact that Ireland has enhanced its standing in global research by steadily building a very credible research base, particularly over the past decade or so.  Our publication rates have doubled, for example, with Ireland's citation rates now surpassing EU and US averages.<\/p><p>  Ireland is now ranked in the global top 20 in all scientific fields and, specifically, by way of example we are ranked first in molecular genetics, and genomics, second in probiotics, third in immunology, sixth in nanotechnology, eighth in materials science and tenth in computer science.  Across the EU we are ranked third, according to the new indication of innovation output, which measures the extent to which ideas from innovative sectors are able to reach the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. This proves we are investing smartly in this area and that our investment is delivering jobs.<\/p> <p> The Government is very much seeking to support, embed and realise a return on investment in science, technology and innovation for national competitive advantage.  Enterprise Ireland, along with the IDA and Science Foundation Ireland, provides a spectrum of science, technology and innovation development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports to create a climate in which sustainable employment will grow and expand.  Employment by companies supported by Enterprise Ireland increased by a net 5,442 in 2013.  This represents the highest level of job growth in a decade and is another positive indication of us moving very much in the right direction.  Similarly, IDA Ireland saw a fourth consecutive year of employment, with in excess of 7,000 net new jobs in 2013 and 164 new investments won, 27 of which were specifically in research, development and innovation.  Science Foundation Ireland is a key part of the enterprise ecosystem, and in 2013, it had links to 41%, or more than 2,500, of the 6,400-odd jobs, or 90 company announcements, announced by the IDA in all fields.<\/p><p> We remain committed to using research and innovation to build competitive advantage.  We have implemented a number of initiatives to accelerate the economic and societal return on our STI investment, to strengthen further enterprise engagement with and take-up of public research, and to drive commercialisation.  Implementation of research prioritisation, under way since March 2012, is seeing the majority of public research funding aligned with 14 priority areas where we are most likely to get economic and societal returns, particularly in the form of jobs, over a period stretching to 2017 and beyond.  The priority areas encompass energy, food, health, ICT and innovation in business processes and services.  They are reflective of Ireland&rsquo;s strengths and future opportunities in various areas of industrial activity.<\/p><p> In line with a recommendation in the research prioritisation report, the adoption of the intellectual property protocol outlines a clear, robust and industry-friendly policy for the commercialisation of intellectual property arising from State-funded research.  As a result of this, the central Technology Transfer Office, cTTO, has been established and the director, Dr. Alison Campbell, is in place since September of last year, along with support staff within Enterprise Ireland.  The cTTO's primary role is to be the identifiable access route to the wealth of technology opportunities and academic talent that exists in research performing organisations.  It will provide a one-stop-shop for entrepreneurs and industry, signposting them towards the relevant sources of knowledge and capability within Ireland&rsquo;s research performing organisations.  The aim of the cTTO is very much to encourage the commercialisation of intellectual property arising from State-funded research, with a view to achieving more job creation from our investment in the area.<\/p><p> The remit of Science Foundation Ireland has been extended recently to enable it to fund applied research as well as oriented basic research.  In response to the specific recommendation that research centres should be more industry focused, he largest ever State-industry co-funded research investment, which is &euro;300 million in total, comprising &euro;200 million in Exchequer funding and &euro;100 million co-invested by 156 industry partners, was announced by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and me in February of last year.  Seven world class SFI research centres will be funded over six years.  They will support key growth areas and research will be undertaken into major social challenges, including health, ageing, communications and energy.  The centres will directly support more than 800 jobs while also acting as a key attractor for foreign direct investment.  There are also 14 existing industry-led research centres, namely, technology centres, which are undertaking research in specific areas in the joint Enterprise Ireland&ndash;IDA Ireland technology centres programme.  The centres are based in a university with support from partner colleges to deliver on the research needs of enterprise.  The Government is also supporting a pilot health innovation hub in Cork that is enabling the development and commercialisation of new ideas from domestic enterprise that will benefit the health care system.<\/p><p> European research framework programmes have always been an important element in providing international links and enhancing the excellence of the Irish research and development system.  With a budget of almost &euro;80 billion covering the next seven years, Horizon 2020 is the biggest ever European research and innovation programme and the largest in existence worldwide.  Agreement on the programme was a central plank of the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s theme of jobs and growth, given the crucial role research and innovation play as key drivers of growth and job creation.  I saw this at first hand because the team who accompanied me to this meeting was central to the negotiations and getting the programme over the line, as it were.  Horizon 2020 offers major opportunities to researchers, research organisations and industry in Ireland to engage in cutting edge research.  This has the potential to power both Ireland and, in a broader sense, Europe towards economic recovery.  The programme maps out the EU&rsquo;s strategic vision for European research and innovation over the next seven years.  The challenge for us in Ireland is to build on our successful experience, to find new research and funding opportunities we can exploit, to reach out to new participants and to increase our level of participation.<\/p><p> The national launch of Horizon 2020 took place last December in the National Convention Centre in Dublin in the company of Commissioner M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  We have put in place a very effective national support framework to maximise the benefits in preparation for our participation in the programme.  The challenge we have set ourselves for Horizon 2020 is to build on our successes in the seventh EU framework programme.  To this end, the Government has set an ambitious target for Irish researchers to win funding of up to &euro;1.25 billion over the lifetime of Horizon 2020.  We have proved that we have an excellent science base on which to compete successfully with the best.  We have every confidence we can achieve the target and boost our research capacity and competitiveness over the lifetime of the programme.  Just as is the case with our own national perspective, good ideas being turned into good jobs is the stated essence of the European Union&rsquo;s recovery and growth strategy, and it is one we will vigorously pursue.<\/p><p> With regard to higher education reform, my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, announced on 30 May a forward-looking re-organisation of the higher education system and a new framework for system governance.  It is clear that if the system is to meet increasing demands for knowledge, innovation and human capital, higher education institutions need to have a strong strategic focus and mission direction, underpinned by a new relationship of accountability with the State.  Funding of the higher education system will be closely related to the delivery of performance outcomes that are aligned to national priorities and key objectives of the system as a whole.  These, as well as key performance indicators for 2014 to 2016, have been outlined clearly in the higher education performance framework.<\/p><p> The Higher Education Authority will report each year to the Minister for Education and Skills on the performance of the system as a whole.  A process of strategic dialogue is under way, as part of the new framework, to agree individual institutional performance compacts with higher education institutions that will reflect each institution&rsquo;s contribution.  This will form part of a new higher education system designed to respond to the future needs of the economy and wider society.  Much earlier in the education system, the discover programme, known formerly as the discover science and engineering programme, is now part of Science Foundation Ireland.  It aims to increase the number of students studying science and mathematics to ensure there is a pipeline of young people who are prepared to pursue third and fourth level qualifications in STEM disciplines for the purpose of securing employment down the line.<\/p><p> In terms of key research, development and innovation initiatives for 2014, Science Foundation Ireland will establish two or three new large-scale research centres, supporting between 200 and 300 jobs, in sectors of national strategic importance such as medical devices, software, diagnostics, telecommunications, smart grids, sustainable food production and processing, among others.  It will fund 3,000 researchers and more than 20 world class research centres.  They are a key magnet for foreign direct investment and will help to ensure Ireland becomes one of Europe&rsquo;s most attractive locations for foreign direct investment.<\/p><p> Enterprise Ireland will support 95 innovative high potential start-up companies this year with an associated 2,100 jobs across a range of sectors.  These companies are potential star performers and each one will create at least &euro;1 million in export sales.<\/p> <p>Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, will continue to drive commercialisation form State-funded research, facilitating the emergence of new products and services that underpin export growth and employment.  In 2013, in excess of 30 spin-offs were generated and more than 120 licences, options and assignments were agreed.  Enterprise Ireland will fund in the region of 80 research and development projects for client companies that are valued in excess of &euro;100,000, while investment in the multi-annual programme for research in third level institutions will continue to improve Ireland's competitive offering in terms of research capability through the delivery of key physical infrastructural projects, that is, buildings and equipment, and research personnel.<\/p><p> I hope that I have touched on the more salient points.  The Government recognises that research, development and innovation form a major plank and we are smartly investing in and prioritising key areas.  We are leveraging industry involvement, bringing in-kind benefits and cash to the table, in partnership with our research infrastructure in a way that will deliver an economic impact.  This is the kernel of our approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014020400003#B00300","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391521500,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his presentation and for attending.

It was effusive in its praise for the Minister of State and the officials who had been handling our Horizon 2020 applications for EU funding.  It is important that we acknowledge this.  I also welcome the Minister of State's acknowledgement that the architecture for much of the investment was put in place by previous Governments.  Some good things were done in that time.<\/p><p>  Given the level of investment in research and development and science in recent years, is the Minister of State satisfied that we are maximising job creation opportunities?

The investment by successive Governments in research, development and innovation is recognised.  Less than 20 years ago, our capacity was much less than it is now and those Governments had the vision to build it.  We are now at a juncture.  We have a highly evolved infrastructure in which those in the oriented, basic research landscape and those in the applied space co-exist well.<br \/>In terms of the potential for maximising job creation, we have designed an infrastructure that is supra-institutional.  Traditionally, the universities and institutes of technology operated inside their own silos and collaborated on specific programmes that had thematic areas of interest, for example, pharma.  We have put together a fund through SFI under which the seven new centres that have been created must collaborate outside of their traditional institutional frameworks.  We have identified 14 areas, including big data and data analytics.  We have co-principal investigators, co-PIs, from six, if not seven, institutions.  The potential for job creation lies in the industrial engagement.  I cannot give the Deputy an exact figure of the number of industrial partners in an entity, but the investment of the industry's money in these new infrastructures is being done with a view to delivering an economic impact, by which I mean job creation.  The philosophy has been to create the seven new infrastructures with more to come this year, to accrue in-kind benefits - people from industry or cash investment - and to get the scientific community to act above its traditional institutions on specific themes and create a vital economic impact.<br \/>The Horizon 2020 target investment is attainable.  By creating new, large-scale infrastructures that supersede individual institutions and by attracting 156 industry partners and &euro;100 million, one creates a leveraging effect that puts one in a stronger position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the &euro;80 billion available in the Horizon 2020 pot.  While UCC or any other institution that the Deputy cares to mention may have been successful under framework No. 7 in its own right, larger infrastructures based on specific themes, strong industrial engagement and targets for small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, engagement in Horizon 2020 strengthens one's leveraging position.  Therefore, one's ability to attain the target becomes more realistic.<br \/>The investment in research, development and innovation is primarily an investment in human capital, for example, excellent scientists.  I do not have an exact breakdown of how much has gone towards bricks and mortar, equipment or human capacity.<\/p> <p>By and large, it is about investment in the very best people in the world in order to create impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014020400005#D00600","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391522100,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Minister of State would address the patent issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014020400006#E00200","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1391522100,"counter":18,"content":"<p>A review of patents is currently under way.  The Deputy will be aware of the technology transfer strengthening initiative.  A review of patents under that initiative is currently under way.  We have created an infrastructure which includes a central technology transfer officer and Enterprise Ireland supported technology transfer officers, TTOs, in the individual institutions, all of whom are tasked with pulling out that intellectual property and creating from it the economic opportunities arising for economic or societal benefit.  Let us take, for example, business investments in research and development.  During periods of economic downturn, it is less likely that companies will engage in research and development because of the cost element.  In other words, during periods of retrenchment companies will engage in a battening down of the hatches.  There is a direct correlation between that and the reduction in the number of patents.  This is being addressed through the national research prioritisation exercise.  <\/p><p>  Let us imagine we had all of the research funders in one room going through action plans for each of the priority areas.  Working with Forf&aacute;s, we have set out metrics in terms of how the institutions should perform, in particular those funded through Science Foundation Ireland, SFI.  I anticipate a behavioural change in this regard from the institutions in the context of what the State expects from them in terms of job creation.  The usual measures within academia are the numbers of publications and citations.  We are driving new metrics in relation to job, patent and licence numbers, etc.  There is a clear expectation among the research community in terms of what Government expects of it.<\/p><p>  A review of the patents is, as I said, under way through the technology transfer strengthening initiative.

Apple is considering locating its new research and development centre not in Ireland, but in Israel.

I apologise if I did not answer that question correctly.  The funding is tied down.  Commitments have been given.  There is potential for further industrial engagement.  For instance, in terms of the seven centres across the seven seams that have been created, there is further scope for industry to tack on to that.  We have created a type of hub and spoke model.  In terms of the current landscape, we are moving into the applied space.  There are greater flexibilities being created in terms of how industry maps on to or partners with academia in relation to creating spin-outs and so on.<br \/>I do not know if we can compare ourselves to Israel <i>per se<\/i>.  Account must be taken of the manner in which Israel does its business through Government investment or external investment, which is quite heavy in research, development and innovation.  It is very well financed and resourced.  There are also a lot more freedoms inherent within that system for individual researchers to draw down pots of money.  They also have flexibilities in terms of how that money is used.  We do not have those freedoms because of the economic constraints on us.  We are moving to a system which ensures that technology transfer is not carried out in a haphazard manner.  I am not suggesting that up to now it has been carried out in that way.  However, sometimes technology transfer within individual institutions could be a matter of whether I, as the technology transfer officer, had a positive or negative relationship with an individual principal investigator.  We are trying to disrupt that dynamic positively.  Bringing in the 156 industry partners means that dynamic cannot but be positively disrupted.  This is because the industry is investing its own money in thematic areas such as, for instance, the pharmaceuticals sector, particularly in Ireland in the context of the move from what are called molecules to medicines, which sector is partnering with academia to sustain jobs already in the system while creating new innovations in relation to how medicines are delivered, thus sending the message from Ireland's pharma sector to parent companies that the Irish Government is not only serious about maintaining investment in pharma here, but also in leveraging new opportunities to strengthen those individual entities relative to the mothership.  That is part of the philosophy, which I accept does not necessarily answer the Deputy's question. <br \/>By setting clear metrics we are setting clear expectations.  If these expectations are not delivered upon, the State agencies or taxpayer then has to review the operations of each of the centres. There is no ambiguity about that.

It is good to see there is a healthy gender balance in his Department.  I thank the Minister of State for coming back to the committee.  He made a very interesting presentation the last time he appeared before it and he gave a commitment to come back to discuss the broad issue of research and development.<\/p><p>  We all recognise the importance of research and development to economic development in the future and currently.  That is taken as a given.  I have a number of questions about different areas.  The Minister of State mentioned the reforms in the higher education sector and made the interesting point that funding of the higher education sector should be closely related to the delivery of performance, which I accept.  Obviously, we have to fund excellence whether it is in third or fourth level institutions or in research and development.  <\/p><p>  Part of the higher education reforms is the formation of a number of technological universities.  In the south east, there is the potential to a merger between Carlow IT and Waterford IT.  I hope that will create new opportunities for research and development but how significant will that be for those institutes because even though they punch above their weight in terms of the ArcLabs and the TSSG in Waterford, which we have discussed previously, there is no baseline funding for research and development for ITs while there is for universities?   There was a perception that a region which did not have a university was operating with one hand tied behind its back and that there was not a level playing field.  If Waterford and Carlow ITs are successful, will they be on the same playing field as other universities in terms of getting baseline funding for research and development?  How will these technological universities sit in the Department's overall plans for research and development?<\/p><p>  In regard to regional supports, obviously I support the need to fund excellence.  I think the Minister of State made the point that any research and development entity of any third or fourth level institution can put forward an application for funding based on whatever the project is and that the Department has to fund what it sees as excellence and the best applications which come before it.  However, there is a need to ensure, as best we can, that we have balanced regional spend.  What targets, if any, are set by the Department in regard to reaching regional targets and ensuring there is a regional spread and to maximise that?<\/p><p>  A previous speaker touched on trying to measure the success of research and development generally.  It can be difficult to get to grips with that in terms of what we spend and the return to the State.  The Horizon 2020 target was 3% of GDP but my understanding is that we will reach 2%.  This State measures a percentage of GNP whereas Europe said it should be GDP but even leaving that aside, we are still behind the target.  I presume those targets are based on outcomes.  How do we measure the funding which goes into research and development?  The Minister of State touched on it in terms of job creation and growth, which are obviously part of it.  Do equity shares come into it?  If there is State-sponsored research, is it shared publicly and measured in terms of a benefit to the State generally?  It is important for us to get a flavour of how the Department measures the benefit to the taxpayer because a significant amount of taxpayers' money is going into research and development.  While it obviously supports the development of companies and enterprise, which we support, there must be a return to the State.  We need to be able to quantify it.  However, for us to understand and measure that, we need to understand how the Department arrives at it.<\/p><p>  We discussed the Unified Patent Court in the past.  Currently, there are approximately 138,000 people working in knowledge-intensive industries, whether in high-end technology or in the pharmaceutical sector.  Last year this State signed the EU agreement in respect of the Unified Patent Court.  That will be a good thing because it will mean there will be a single patent for companies across Europe rather than having to apply to each member state.  In the coming weeks, the Department must decide whether it will host a local division of the UPC or whether it will cede to a regional division of the court, which would probably be based in London.  What are the Minister of State's and his Department's thoughts on that because we have been lobbied on it by a number of organisations, or least my office has been?  I am trying to find out what the Minister of State believes would be best?  Would having a local division of the court sitting in Dublin cost less for us?  Would it be more accessible for SMEs, in particular?  At what factors is the Department looking?  What criteria will the Department use in terms of making that decision?  Will it consult and take on board the views of the SME sector and the technology sector generally?  Before it makes that decision, would the Minister of State be in a position to come to this committee with his recommendations on what he believes would be best in this area because it is an important decision?  It is important that this committee has an opportunity to discuss it.  What is the timescale for that decision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014020400007#F00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1391522700,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.  I concur with Deputy Calleary's comments on our recent visit to Europe and the compliments paid to the Minister of State's staff on the great work that is being done.   I refer to the technology centres, which are currently linked to universities.  This is the only country in the OECD which does that.  In other countries, the technology centres are partnered with industry.  The IDA and Enterprise Ireland can draw down money individual without being attached to a university.  Why can we not do that if we are spending all this money on innovation, which is hugely important to economic recovery and on which we all agree.<\/p><p>  We spoke about Israel which has a more open way of doing research and innovation.  In terms of its funding models, it is very open to state funding and diaspora funding.  We talk about the 70 million Irish diaspora around the world but Israel has nailed down funding very well with the Jewish community.  It is something about which we are now talking.<\/p><p>  There is no reference to second level education and the possibility of entrepreneurship, which is a direct link to research and innovation, as a subject that people could study and which could be part of the new curriculum.  That would certainly focus the mind on entrepreneurship. <\/p><p>  There is a huge issue with lack of funding in regard to third level education which is directly related to entrepreneurship.  If a young person has a PhD or otherwise, it is very hard to get funding to stay in that space and to try to develop a business unlike in other jurisdictions.  Could we put some funding into a pilot scheme in that area?<\/p> <p>The Minister of State will be familiar with Dr. O'Shea, a fellow Corkonian, who is head of business development and running Washington University which has a budget of $500 million.  Of that sum, $84 million goes directly to driving research, innovation and entrepreneurship.  If one has an idea that gets vetted, one will get $50,000 to bring the concept to the next stage.  One will then get another $100,000 to work on the project before it becomes commercialised.  We are placing the emphasis on industry, in particular the multinationals, which is very welcome but we should look at developing some homegrown talent and make it a little easier for them to pursue their ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014020400007#F00300","speaker":"988","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391523300,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his team and thank him for all the information he has supplied.

I know there is an aspirational target set for 2020 and ideally we would like to be hitting it, but current conditions do not allow us to do that.  Small countries have to be smart and specialise in very specific areas of opportunity.  I think that is what we are doing.  We have identified 14 core areas, and food is identified as a national priority.  Already one of the new SFI centres is very much mapped on to the potential for food.  The Alimentary Pharmabiotic Centre, APC, is a research company led by Professor Fergus Shanahan and his team of researchers in UCC with investment in the region of &euro;40 million.  They are exploring the next wave of opportunity in the area of food, probiotics and functional foods.  They are currently mapping the human digestive tract at microbial level with a view to distinguishing between the good and bad bacteria and creating medicinal products that will be vital to sustain humanity.  Their work has a global focus.  The researchers from Teagasc, the dairy and pharma industries are mapped into the activity.<\/p><p>  We are focused on the next wave of potential in areas such as food, pharma and medical devices.  These are our inherent core strengths and will allow us to compete with industries in other countries, such as New Zealand.  We are lagging behind Singapore in terms of the delivery of education, particularly in relation to STEM subjects, science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  We have programmes such as the \"Smart Futures\" and \"Discover\".  There is flexibility in the new junior cycle curriculum to introduce STEM related activities.<\/p><p>  In my role in the Department of Education and Skills, I have responsibility for the policy of STEM.  We have set up a STEM educational review group, comprising academia and industry partners - chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith - and operating at arms length which is doing a complete mapping exercise on all STEM activity throughout the country, whether it is industrial engagement, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA or the State agencies delivering education.  If we can collate all of the activity, we can then create an impact through the primary and post-primary schools by inculcating an even greater sense of the potential of education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics in terms of the jobs that need to be created downstream.  <\/p><p>  I have a real personal interest in pedagogical research.  The primary school teachers have to be given the skill sets and have the tools that allow them to have complete confidence to teach mathematics and science related subjects.  Teachers at primary school level have to teach across a myriad of subjects.  An idea emanating from the STEM committee is the need to spend more on research to assist teachers so that we can achieve higher scores on the PISA and other international ranking tests and to adopt the methodologies that are inherent in places such as Singapore, Finland and Estonia.  That will allow us to create economic opportunities down stream and enable us to compete with other centres.  That is the philosophy that is guiding us.  The review group will report to me very soon.<\/p><p>  I will now respond to the questions on the regions.  Senator Cullinane mentioned TSSG, Telecommunications Software &amp;amp; System Group.  One only has to look at how many successful applications that have come from TSSG, a company formed as part of the Waterford Institute of Technology, in the south east, to see how well they have done on FP7.  They have done very well because there are excellent people in TSSG.  What must drive research and development is excellence and not regional considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014020400008#G00400","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1391523300,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I accept that point.

The calls from SFI are open to any institution and are based on the ability of the institution to attract the right personnel.  I am very familiar with the work that is going on in Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, and how the IOTs compete with the universities.  The recent Irish Photonics Centre is led by the Tyndall National Institute comprising UCC and CIT.  The excellent research base in light and photonics in CIT has allowed it become academic partners and win when the call was put out by SFI.<br \/>The process of creating a technological university is under way.  The issue of baseline funding will have to be teased out.  The targets for research performing organisations are set out and we have mapped out where SFI, the Health Research Board and Teagasc spend money.  We have conducted a research prioritisation exercise and established the priorities.  If we are to set out what we call compacts for each institution in terms of performance, we must have a level playing field.  A research entity may have expectations but in the case of a dearth of baseline funding, the question of performance has to be considered in the light of circumstances.  Let me sound a warning and say, without prejudice, that this is still an evolving process.  It must happen in a collaborative way and through a conciliatory process.

If one looks at the revisions to the research and development tax credit, we have tried to improve the system in a way that allows for an increase in the amount of expenditure on what we call a full volume basis.  It used to be based on a base year but now we are increasing the limit from &euro;200,000 to &euro;300,000.  We are trying to encourage more SMEs to participate in research and development.  We have put in place an increase, from 10% to 15%, in the limit on the amount of qualifying research and development expenditure that can be outsourced to another company.

An agreement was reached in February 2013.  We have a decision to make on Ireland's position with regard to a local or out-of-state court, and that decision will be made in due course.  The process of engaging with stakeholders is arguably still ongoing.<\/p><p>  On CERN, I make the point that the European Space Agency, ESA, is not often heard about in the public domain.  If one was to measure the column inches on the ESA versus CERN, CERN would garner many more inches.  However, if one considers our membership of ESA, an area for which I have particular policy responsibility, we have carried out an analysis of our investment of &euro;17 million and found it has directly impacted on turnover to the tune of some &euro;250 million for Irish and FDI-related companies because it has allowed those companies to win contracts.  For example, Radisens Diagnostics is a company that, through its engagement with the ESA, has won significant funding nationally and is now winning serious funding rounds internationally.  The position is similar with Treemetrics, a company that has also won grant aid from the ESA and a company this committee might be more familiar with in terms of the impact it is creating in regard to global forestry solutions.<\/p><p>  It has been said we can get an associate membership of CERN for &euro;1 million.  The reason we are carrying out the review is that we need to kick the tyres on that statement.  We are carrying out a review of our membership of all international organisations.  However, it is only fair, if we are carrying out a review of our membership, to do so in the best interests of the taxpayer, which has to be the bottom line in all of this.  The question in my mind, given there is now a campaign, which we all welcome, is whether it is the case that individual researchers are barred from accessing CERN as a facility by virtue of the fact that Ireland has not paid its &euro;1 million associate membership.  I have not seen any evidence to suggest they are barred.  As I understand it, although I stand to be corrected, individual academic institutions can pay a particular fee, whatever that is, or they might have an arrangement with an external university which will allow Irish researchers access to the facility of CERN.<\/p><p>  We are being very honest about our approach on this and we have an open mind on it.  Before making the decision to invest &euro;17 million in the ESA, we undertook an economic analysis.  It is only fair that we undertake an economic analysis and, potentially, a societal analysis of the impact of our membership of CERN.  To be fair, while I do not want to be facetious, I have heard it said that CERN has been great for humanity and it has brought us the Internet.  However, the Internet was coming anyway, and it is not certain whether we would have had an influence on that, or perhaps there were Irish researchers already there who had an influence.  If we spend &euro;1 million on associate membership or &euro;12 million on full membership, will it have a quantitative impact on our interaction with CERN?  That is the question that has to be asked.<\/p><p>  I believe we should have the review.  I take absolute cognisance of the bona fides of those who are campaigning on this issue.  They are excellent researchers who are part of international consortia which have access to CERN.  However, the question has to be asked what is the benefit in real terms and what kind of contracts will Ireland get from it.  I would like to look at countries of a comparable size to Ireland and see what benefits they have derived from their membership of CERN in terms of various contracts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014020400010#J00300","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1391524500,"counter":54,"content":"<p>To follow on from that, CERN is the result of a collaboration among a number of European countries.

The closing date for submissions is midnight tonight and we will make a submission in advance of the deadline.  The review will examine how Ireland will gain maximum benefit from the resources it commits to international engagements in a rapidly changing world.  As a committee, we are examining the effectiveness of Ireland's engagement with the Council, including the central role of the permanent representative in Brussels whom some of us met a couple of weeks ago.  We are also examining other issues such as bilateral engagement with member states, relations with the European Commission and relations with the European Parliament.<\/p><p>  Today's meeting is an opportunity to hear three very distinct voices on these issues.  Mr. Tony Connelly from RTE has been based in Brussels since 2001, in effect, for the past 13 years.  He has reported comprehensively on the evolving relationship between Ireland and the European Union.  Boasting a distinguished parliamentary career as a Minister, Deputy and MEP, Proinsias De Rossa, has a valuable perspective on how Ireland's influence within the European institutions can be both safeguarded and enhanced.  Dr. John O'Brennan lectures on European politics at NUI, Maynooth, where he is also director of the centre for the study of wider Europe.<\/p> <p>His research interests span EU enlargement, Ireland's experience of European integration and the fallout from the eurozone crisis which continues to complicate EU politics.<br \/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

It is a pleasure to be here.  The opinions I offer are my own.  Nobody else is responsible for them, nor am I responsible to anybody else for them, which is a new pleasure I enjoy.<br \/>First, I suggest that the most important thing Ireland can do in Europe is to insist on the practical implementation of the Lisbon treaty in all its aspects, and not just in respect of the Single Market.  Second, in respect of the current foreign policy review, we as a people need to deepen our relationship with the European Union beyond ensuring Irish interests, which phrase is emphasised time and again in the public consultation document.  There is nothing intrinsically wrong with that, but it must be a part of a wider commitment to constructing a Union that is more democratic, more socially engaged and seeks to end economic inequality.  Others in Europe would join us in such a project, but we would need to show our commitment to these principles by actively implementing them in Ireland.<br \/>In Articles 2 and 3 of the Lisbon treaty, there is an excellent statement of values and objectives, while the democratic principles of the Union are set out in Articles 9 to 19 on the functioning of the EU.  However, there is still a lot of work to do in demonstrating a real commitment to them and in fleshing out democratic processes which span national frontiers in a way that makes citizens feel they are part of the process.  As well as protecting our back, we need to ask ourselves what contribution we can make to mapping a better European Union.  All politicians with a commitment to the EU, and not just Ministers, must lead that process by engaging with the public and the EU institutions in teasing through Europe's options in a rapidly changing world, where the only constant is the dominance of global finance which has escaped democratic control, crosses frontiers with impunity and dictates to democratic governments what they may or may not do and even what taxes they may collect.  As a consequence, the EU has been through its first almost fatal crisis, and it is not yet clear that it will survive as anything more than a Single Market.<br \/>Despite the experience of the crisis, the indispensable institutional and regulatory changes which only a transnational body such as the EU has the weight to achieve have been painfully slow and piecemeal because of the interplay of national interests which too often seem to trump the need for solidarity between us.  For example, despite the EU rhetoric that job creation is the priority, the broadening of the remit of the ECB to ensure it also gives employment creation that priority is not even on the agenda.  Its current remit states that &quot;the primary aim of the ECB shall be to maintain price stability&quot;,<i><\/i>while in that bastion of capitalism, the US, the Federal Reserve is mandated to &quot;conducting the nation's monetary policy by influencing the money and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long term interest rates&quot;.<i><\/i>I would argue that such a reform should be high on our European agenda.<br \/>There is, too, an urgent necessity for a serious EU budget to build a better system of social transfers between states, which would make real the Lisbon commitment to social solidarity in a social market economy.  I suggest that a financial transaction tax could be a major contribution to the development of such a budget based on EU so-called own resources which would not be dependent on what member states can spare from their coffers.<br \/>I suggest a way of engaging domestically and at European level in this debate about embedding the EU as part of our political culture is to establish a forum on the future of Europe, but make it more directly representative of citizens than the previous forum, as this Parliament has done with the current Constitutional Convention, and then go a step further by including elected councillors as full members as a way of reaching out to the most basic level of representative democracy.  In that way, we would be reaching out to more citizens for their contribution.  Committee members should not wait for the next treaty change to land on their desks before this is done.  We should do it now to mark the 100th anniversary of that man-made catastrophe that was the First World War, and have its first report ready for 2016 as a fitting way to mark the maturity of this State.  Its debates could be used among other things to broaden our understanding of the concept of sovereignty and the value of sharing it with other like-minded democracies as a means of creating a greater European democratic space.  I believe that having a serious debate on sovereignty now will help to undercut the interminable argument by Europhobes about Ireland abandoning its sovereignty.<br \/>One of the questions in the consultation document relates to Northern Ireland and how we can help there.  I suggest that having a mature debate in an EU context on sovereignty and what it means in today's world would help to undermine the grip of irredentist republicanism on those on this island who continue to claim a fantasy mandate to kill their neighbours in our name, based on a 19th century concept of sovereignty.  I believe such a process would deepen our commitment to the idea of a united Europe and ensure we have something important to contribute to the treaty reforms that have to happen if the EU is to survive as more than a Single Market.<br \/>Surviving the crises will not of itself reassure those who now fear for their future, or despair of ever getting a job again.  Some people are turning in despair to extreme right wing groups, and some seek reassurance by reverting to conservative religious stereotypes which primarily penalise women, but also gay men.  National chauvinism is giving rise to a tendency towards the fracturing of some states and a resurgence of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and anger toward immigrants.  This is accompanied in some states by militia style vigilantes hunting and killing presumed immigrants and other minorities.  These developments require us to reform our economics and tax systems to deliver more economic equality.  They require us to rebuild our health, education and social systems to deliver effectively social solidarity in a way that reassures people they have a secure future.  We need to avoid playing a zero-sum game by narrowing our politics to defend so-called national democracy or national culture, either unconsciously of for populist reasons.  It also requires centre right and centre left parties to mount without delay a vigorous defence of human rights and democratic values domestically and in Europe.<br \/>We can begin that process this year when the Government sets out to nominate a Commissioner, and with regard to selecting the next President of the Commission.  This committee could do a service to the citizen by discussing the criteria for the person or persons we send to serve at the highest level in Europe for the next five years.  What expertise will they bring to the table?  What political, economic and social values will they bring and are they in line with the objectives and values outlined in the Lisbon treaty?<br \/>The European Parliament has hearings and can approve or reject a nominee for the Commission, as well as the nominee for President of the Commission, based on whether they are fit for the job and committed to EU values.  This committee and its members could also hold hearings to examine the Irish Government's nominee to satisfy themselves as to the person's credentials and his or her approach to various key issues.  Would the person support a financial transaction tax?<\/p> <p>Would they support a European initiative to ensure decent jobs in line with the ILO criteria?  Would they support a European minimum wage?  Would they support a proactive global campaign to end child labour?  An associated question would be whether they would oppose policies that would undermine the European social model.  All of these matters have a direct bearing on the well-being of our citizens and their perception of the European Union as a force for good.  All members would have their own list of questions but the key point is that the importance of cementing citizens' commitment to the EU cannot be left to the happenstance of who needs to be promoted or, as some would have it, exiled regardless of their policy priorities or commitment to Europe.<br \/>Many of the political groupings in the European Parliament have nominated a candidate for the post of Commission President.  The idea is that people who vote in these elections can see that their vote is not only electing an MEP but also has an influence on who will run the next Commission.  A step that this committee could take is to ascertain if the Irish Government is committed to applying Article 17.7 of the Lisbon treaty which reads: &quot;Taking into account the elections to the European Parliament and after having held the appropriate consultations, the European Council ... shall propose ... a candidate for President of the Commission.&quot;<br \/>I think we have to insist that the Government does not go along with some member states who reportedly would rather ignore the wishes of the electorate and want to continue the old practice of making a decision behind closed doors and then presenting the European Parliament with a <i>fait accompli.  <\/i>There are many more issues I could address, but given the time constraints, I will leave it at that for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Proinsias De Rossa","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391523000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Proinsias De Rossa.

I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the ongoing review.  I wish to touch on four elements in my contribution, the first of which is the Irish priorities in the European Union and the way we defend and promote our interests; the second, how we communicate Europe in Ireland, why our EU membership is important, and developments in European integration in general; the third, the importance of further enlargement to the western Balkans, Turkey, and potentially further - it was interesting to see Commissioner &Scaron;tefan F&uuml;le talking about offering Ukraine a membership perspective in recent days; and the fourth, the role of the Oireachtas in the relationship between Government and Parliament in the European integration sphere.<br \/>In regard to Irish priorities and strategies in Europe, we have exited the bailout but this is still a very critical juncture for Ireland and for Ireland in Europe.  I wish to reinforce what Professor Ben Tonra said to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade last month when he spoke about the foreign policy review.  We must be smarter about how we use and deploy our resources in Brussels and elsewhere.  In particular, that means re-examining our network of embassies and the kind of activities in which they engage.  It seems to me there is something of an imbalance currently, with the understandable emphasis on reconstituting the economy and the move towards incorporating trade as a more important element of activity.  We should not lose the significance of the traditional nuts and bolts of diplomacy in the EU, which is so important in the context of the Council of Ministers and the broader institutional environment.  It is important that we continue to maintain a presence in every EU capital and continue to maintain the very basic tools of diplomacy which are so valuable in the EU-28 context, having eyes and ears on the ground and sufficient human capacity in order that people can engage in national capitals with parliamentarians, government ministers, civil society, business and so on.  All of that is critical as legislation is proposed and is going through the cycle in Brussels.  There is simply no substitute for human intelligence.  I think we have to beef up our smaller representations rather than rationalising or diverting attention away to Asia where there is an understandable need for further representation.  A core focus has got to remain on the Council of Ministers and the EU legislative cycle.<br \/>I will make a further point about Irish representation in the institutions.  I know Government is concerned about this in that many of the people who entered the Commission in particular are coming towards retirement age and that the number of Irish people entering the EU institutions has fallen dramatically.  We have to examine that seriously and also ways of incentivising people coming out of the universities, for example, to consider going into the Commission, the Parliament and elsewhere.  There is simply no substitute for having Irish nationals in positions of influence across the institutional matrix.  I was reminded of that again in Brussels last week in almost every meeting, where the cup of coffee or the casual drink one has with somebody may not be important in the immediate context but down the line it may be crucial where there is an issue of importance to our country within the Council.<br \/>I am aware the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs is visiting all the universities next month and he is very serious about tackling this problem.  I know that faculty members throughout the country also are giving this a good deal of thought.  We must increase the representation of our nationals across the board in Brussels.<br \/>My second point is about the way we communicate the importance of our membership to Irish citizens.  We know from many years of regular polling that Irish people continue to be seriously ignorant and ill-informed about developments within the EU.  Successive referendums have revealed the persistent theme of that lack of knowledge as a common variable in the Irish experience of European integration.  We simply must do more to bridge that gap, and again the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs is seriously considering new vehicles that might help us tackle that problem.<br \/>I agree very much with Mr. De Rossa's suggestion that some kind of reconstituted public space where people who are actively dealing with Europe, whether they are politicians, academics or otherwise, could initiate and continue conversations around the country.  I am involved with Europe Direct, which is an initiative of the Commission but which is done through public libraries.  There have been a number of meetings thus far and I have been very impressed with them.  They have echoed what the forum did in the past but we could expand that significantly with a little imagination.<br \/>A further point relates to the longer term, that is, the place of Europe, our membership of the EU within the school system, and how we construct a proper civic education process in order that people can be aware of the significance of Irish membership of the EU.  At the moment, the only place where this happens is within the second level curriculum in the social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme, but that tends to be rather haphazard and <i>ad hoc<\/i>and it has suffered like other programmes as priorities have had to be changed during and through the recession.  I think there is a very good case for putting very significant resources into both primary and secondary level and ensuring children coming through the system have some understanding of the place of Europe within the broader civic landscape.  I also think there is a need for a much expanded role for this in the university system.  I would argue that every single university student should be compelled to take at least one module in European integration in order that they become familiar with the institutional landscape and that when they go out into the world as engineers, doctors or whatever else, as leaders in their fields, they have internalised the contours of Europe and why they are significant for Ireland.  If resources could be directed towards them, universities would be quite willing.<br \/>My third point relates to EU enlargement.  This is my specialist area of research.  I have been immersed in it since the mid-1990s and I have grave concerns at the moment about the political will across EU capitals to achieve further enlargement.  So far as I can see there is an open and shut case for including the western Balkans within the European Union.<\/p> <p>At the moment there are unmistakable signs that many EU capitals have gone cold on the idea, for all kinds of reasons. Ireland has been identified, rightly I think, as a champion of enlargement in the past.  Certainly that was the case in respect of 2004 and there is a lot of goodwill towards us.<br \/>I urge the Government and parliamentarians to remain positive about enlargement and to remain a strong advocate, particularly to extend enlargement to the western Balkans, including Turkey.  I am in favour of Turkish membership once the accession criteria has been satisfied and we should make a case for same.  Three quarters of the current membership of 28 were former enlargement states so we all have a stake in this measure.  The goodwill that recent entrants have towards the EU is significant but it is one that we, in turn, should play a role in replicating, in the current context, in the western Balkans.<br \/>Finally, I shall discuss the role of the Oireachtas.  Some members will be aware of my views on the matter.  The Oireachtas punches significantly below its weight in terms of European integration that is broadly defined.  Parliament must take much more responsibility and step up to the plate across a range of spheres.  This is particularly the case in terms of the scrutiny of EU legislation.  The scrutiny that takes place in the Oireachtas is almost laughable and the change to a mainstream system has not worked.  I am in favour of condensing the work around European legislation to a single committee, the European Affairs committee.  The way that one can do so is to provide it with the necessary resources.  Therefore, one would need to significantly increase the resources of the EU committee which should be the primary vehicle.  We must address the imbalance in power where the executive has almost all of the prerogatives where European integration is concerned.  We must swing that back so that parliamentarians can engage in the proper and substantive amount of scrutiny and oversight of executive action in Brussels.<br \/>The current situation is not good enough.  There must be a stronger role for Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to play in the process.  There are all kinds of ideas about how that might happen and we could interrogate some of those in questions.  A stronger role for the Seanad, for example, is frequently mentioned and I favour the suggestion if the resource question is addressed and the circumstances are right.  The role of the Oireachtas must be beefed up for foreign policy in general and most especially in the European integration context.  I shall leave my comments at that and we can return to some of the issues later.<br \/><b>Chairman:<\/b>I thank Dr. O'Brennan and I call our next speaker, Mr. Tony Connelly.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391523600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I have reported from Europe on the European Union since 2001, the year that Ireland rejected the Nice treaty.  I have covered various referenda and events since then up to the fiscal compact treaty, exiting the bailout, plus the second Irish Presidency of the EU that I have covered which has just finished.  I shall outline to the committee the perception of Ireland at the end of all of those events and what political capital that may give the Government in shaping its strategic vision for its interaction with Europe and the wider world.  There is no doubt, having spoken to people both from member states and the institutions, that Ireland's reputation has been restored.  We are experiencing some kind of after-glow following a very effective Presidency and the exiting of the bailout.  That has been crystalised in the discussions and speculation about the future role of the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, as a potential presidential candidate for the European Commission.  Whether he wants to participate is another question.<br \/>Ireland's political capital has largely been restored following the awful events of the banking collapse and bailout.  Also,  there was an overhang of some discontent and criticism about the way various referenda were handled in Ireland.  Whatever about the democratic vote of the people at the time, broadly speaking, Ireland is now seen as a mainstream player in the European Union.  It is becoming more mainstream the more the UK drifts to the right and towards a more eurosceptic trajectory. <br \/>The Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, is a member of the European People's Party, the largest group in the parliament.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, is a member of the socialist group and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE.  All of these factors, and the fact that we are also in the euro is viewed as evidence that we are seen increasingly as a constructive, stable and forward looking European partner.<br \/>Having said that, the Europe that we have merged into, after the bailout and the Presidency, is much different and much changed from 2001, and even 2008 to 2009.  The challenges that Europe face will be a major difficulty for Ireland and for the European Union. <br \/>Looking ahead, we have the UK referendum, an &quot;in-out&quot; referendum, that could be poisonous and very difficult for the Irish Government to deal with.  The European Parliament elections are coming up and significant inroads could be made by far right eurosceptic candidates and far left groups in the European Parliament.  The trade deal with the US has also run into difficulty.  Migration is also a very difficult political hot potato that member states are not prepared to take risks with.  Perhaps it will fall to Europe and the European Commission to frame some kind of far-reaching migration-emigration policy.  Africa will be a major foreign policy challenge to the European Union.  All of the upheaval that has emerged from the Libyan crisis seems to have opened up a vacuum in the Sahel that is being filled by radical Islamists.  Therein lies the seeds of potential terrorist attacks in Europe in five to ten years' time.  These are some of the challenges that Ireland must confront over the next few years. <br \/>The question is as follows.  Does the experience of the bailout and the very painful reform programme that Ireland has gone through give the Government a particular advantage or political capital?  There may be an expectation, and there is certainly a desire, among some of the institutions that Ireland will use its bailout experience to put itself forward as a possible model for growth and reform.  Our ability to attract foreign direct investment is unrivalled in the European Union <i>per capita<\/i>.  There will be an expectation for the Government to punch above its weight and be a more assertive player.  Even though the Presidency is over the opportunity to do so still exists.  <br \/>Ireland is largely seen as a pragmatic country and we are not constrained in one particular group.  Of course Ireland is very close to the UK in a lot of areas such as taxation and justice and home affairs yet we are not virulently anti-regulation.  We are close to the Baltic countries on taxation yet we are close to France and Spain on agriculture.  We are trying to position ourselves as being closer to the northern European creditor rules-based community that we heard so much about during the crisis.  Certainly we have decoupled ourselves, in terms of reputation, from Greece and perhaps Cyprus.  <br \/>I shall outline another expectation.  Ireland is viewed as being close to America.  The Irish Government made quite a play and was quite triumphant about the fact that it was able to commence trans-Atlantic trade negotiations with the United States during its Presidency.  However, the talks have ran into trouble with the Congressional mid-term elections approaching.  Two questions are being asked in Brussels.  Will the Irish Government take up the cudgel again on behalf of the trade agreement?  Or will it sit back, like many other countries seem happy to do, and let the trade agreement talks drift?  <br \/>We have heard about taxation many times.  People always ask me the following questions when I return to Ireland.  Is the Irish corporate tax rate safe?  Are they out to get us?<\/p> <p>We can always go back to the reality that taxation remains a national competence.  There is a veto and many other countries have similar taxation aspirations.  There will be major developments at OECD level over the next few months leading up to the G20 summit in September.  The double Irish tax arrangements, the Dutch sandwich and various other loopholes that exist will come under a great deal of pressure at G20 level and they are not sustainable.<\/p><p> With regard to how the permanent representative and the Irish presence in Brussels operates, there was universal praise for the Irish Presidency.  People have spoken repeatedly about the professionalism of the Civil Service and the fact that Ministers were prepared to make the journey not just to Brussels but to Strasbourg and Luxembourg.  It was felt that the Ministers put many hard yards in and did a great deal of hard work with the European Parliament which is much more important, given the Lisbon treaty.  However, the Irish Presidency was in a cluster of first-time Presidencies, including Cyprus and Lithuania, and, therefore, it was not that difficult for Ireland to make a big impact.  We were seen as having done our homework on all the dossiers and civil servants were professional.  There was a sense that Ireland's honour was at stake following the EU-IMF bailout programme and the Presidency was the opportunity to address that.  One perspective I got on the way the Irish permanent representative worked is the ambassador, Rory Montgomery, seemed to have much more discretion and room for manoeuvre in making decisions on behalf of the Presidency rather than having to constantly run a particular policy or line back to Dublin through various levels.  I have heard the word \"envy\" being used in that context.  Ireland was much more pragmatic and had much more discretion and room for manoeuvre.<\/p><p> We are back to where we were before the Celtic tiger happened.  There was definitely a perception in Brussels that the Celtic tiger was accompanied by a certain level of hubris, a certain cavalier attitude to Europe that we did not need the EU and that we had largely become rich on our own initiative.  There were reservations about some of the policy decisions and logistical decisions Charlie McCreevy made as Commissioner.  That did not go down well in Brussels and that sense lingered for some time.  That was compounded by the events surrounding the bank guarantee scheme, the lack of regulation of banks and perhaps a fiscal policy which poured fuel on the fires that were raging at the time.  However, people were aware that Ireland was not alone and other countries had caused problems for the rest of Europe in terms of regulation and banking policy.  The UK, Spain and Cyprus have all come in for criticism.  Now Ireland is back and its reputation is largely restored.  The question for the Government will be what it will do with that reputation.<\/p><p> I refer to the EU and the world.  We are again in a changed set of circumstances with the creation of the EU External Action Service, EEAS, which is often referred to as the 29th member of the Union.  It is a strong bureaucratic body that is supposed to project European foreign policy with a strong voice.  There are criticisms that this has diluted and diminished the impact Ireland could have.  The Government sometimes struggles to get purchase on its policies at foreign affairs level but there are examples such as Zimbabwe where the Government along with other smaller member states was able to push the question of relaxing sanctions against the country in order that civil society and development organisations could benefit from a dialogue with the Union.  Eventually that became EU policy.  The opportunity, therefore, is there, although it is a greater struggle for countries such as Ireland when the EEAS is trying to develop its muscle and project its particular force on the world stage.<\/p><p> With regard to Ireland's traditional policy of neutrality, there is a perception that it is an irrelevance and there is puzzlement that Ireland is guided and bound by the triple lock given we do not have a voice at Security Council level but we have a voice at EU level and, therefore, why should we not go down that path.  There is also a feeling that while Ireland has been positive in the context of development aid and in projecting its aspirations through organisations such as Concern and GOAL, this may not be enough in the 21st century.  The security challenges Europe faces will require a blend of force, diplomacy and development aid.  As Kofi Annan said, there is no security without development and there is no development without security.<\/p><p> A major issue that will confront the Government in the next few years is the UK and its relationship with the EU.  It will be a major challenge given the apparent trajectory of the UK out of the Union.  There is concern that an unstoppable momentum has been created and Ireland will have to assess its posture regarding the UK.  The first challenge will come later this year with the European Arrest Warrant, EAW.  Under the Lisbon treaty, the UK can opt out of as many elements of justice and home affairs as it wants and the big expectation is that it could opt out of the EAW and that will automatically call into legal question what will happen in extradition cases between Ireland and the UK.  How the Government handles the debate as it takes place in Europe and as it filters through into the media-tabloid sector in Ireland will be important.  Ireland is seen as a constructive, pro-European member of the Union, yet it is close to the UK on tax, security and justice and home affairs issues.  However, it is not perceived as a troublemaker.  For example, I heard anecdotally that Viviane Reding, the Justice Commissioner did not realise Ireland had an opt-out on criminal justice matters because we do not shout that from sidelines and we keep it to ourselves.  We are seen as diverging from the UK on some key issues.<\/p><p> The perception is Ireland's reputation is largely restored in Brussels.  It is up to the Government to see what it does with that political capital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Connelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391524200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>We have had three interesting presentations.  I welcome Mr. De Rossa's suggestion about the Forum on Europe, which would be useful.  He referred to the committee holding hearings on future appointments of Commissioners by the Government.  While I would welcome the opportunity to cross-examine the appointees on their thoughts on issues such as the financial transactions tax, there is a danger these could turn into confirmation hearings akin to what happens in the US.  The Oireachtas had a recent experience in this regard when the chairman of EirGrid appeared before a committee.  These meetings could turn into a circus with opponents of the nominee using the forum to try to bring them down.  How would we make sure that such hearings did not turn into a circus and added value to the proceedings?<\/p><p>  Dr. O'Brennan said we should re-examine our smaller embassies and build our representation rather than focus on Asia.  The announcement of the opening of an embassy in Zagreb, Croatia will mean we have an embassy in the 27 EU capitals.  Some of those are single diplomat embassies, particularly in the Baltic states.<\/p> <p>An example is Estonia where one diplomat covers a range of activities on behalf of the Irish people.<\/p><p> While I agree it is important that we have sufficient representation across all of the countries in Europe how do we ensure that we also have representation in countries such as Chile, Venezuela or even Iran where we recently closed an office?  These countries have growing populations, of between 30 million and 50 million people.  We have significant trade with them and in some cases many members of the diaspora live there.  New Zealand is an example.  We do not have an embassy there.  How do we balance those needs with the need to have representation in the 28 capitals in the EU? <\/p><p> If there are unmistakable signs in some European capitals that they would like a slow-down in accession by western Balkan states how do we square that with the decisions on the accession of Serbia and Albania and the opening of chapter 23 in respect of Turkey?  I thought that the mood music from the capitals was to continue with enlargement, that they are keen for more countries to come in, particularly the Balkans, but not to rush this because they need to make sure the internal laws of these countries are up to speed with what European citizens expect from member states. <\/p><p> Mr. Connolly&rsquo;s point about the Presidency is well made.  Every time this committee visits fellow politicians across Europe we hear how successful the Presidency was.  I am glad to hear what he said about our permanent representative, Mr. Rory Montgomery, because we often hear how successful the politicians were during the Presidency but that could not have been the case without the support of the officials.  They were outstanding before and throughout the Presidency.<\/p><p> Mr. Connolly said that our political capital has been restored to a large extent and suggested that we can earn more capital by taking up the cudgel of the American trade agreement.  What does he think we can achieve in respect of the recapitalisation of the banks and how can we achieve that?  He knows the Government&rsquo;s position on seeking retrospective recapitalisation.  Does he think that is possible or are there are other ways to achieve that overall aim.  If so, what are they? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400006#E00200","speaker":"1076","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391524800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I am sorry I was late for Mr. De Rossa&rsquo;s presentation.  It seems that the EU works as a unit in brokering trade agreements with different countries.  I do not know how that works in practice.  Does Mr. De Rossa think it works well?  How are Ireland&rsquo;s interests served when we try to develop agreements with certain countries?<\/p><p>  Dr. O'Brennan touched on the disconnection from, and the communication of, the EU in Ireland.  He mentioned polling.  I did a poll which nobody seems to care about.  My office surveyed approximately 300 people around Grafton Street and 91% of them could not name one MEP.  Those who could named Gay Mitchell.  Fewer named Emer Costello and hardly anyone named Paul Murphy.  Do the witnesses have any views on the co-option of people from the substitute list?  I understand that Paul Murphy was not on that list, which would be perfectly legitimate if none of the people on the substitute list were available to go to Europe.  I have nothing personal against any individual but do the witnesses believe that contributes to the sense of disconnection that seems to exist?<\/p><p>  I release comments on EU matters to the media quite frequently but they are rarely picked up.  I have touted that poll to various members of the media and at this stage I am just boring them.  RTE could play a better role in the communication of what is happening in the EU.  Unless one is an insomniac who happens to be watching television on that one day of the month when the EU is covered one will not know anything about it.  Mr. Connolly does a very good job on the news programmes of keeping us up to date but we need more information from the EU.  What would Mr. De Rossa think of holding regular fora with MEPs in Ireland or some form of communication?  Who knows who would turn up at these events?  There could be quarterly fora for MEPs.  It is a good idea for students to get involved in politics generally and particularly in respect of the EU. <\/p><p>  Over the weekend I attended the Convention on the Constitution where I met members of the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, who were here to discuss African development and democracy.  They mentioned European involvement in the development of democracy in Africa.  Do the witnesses think that there is a role to be more fully explored in that respect or is it already up and running?  It is not on my radar.  The members of AWEPA said that Ireland because of its history, and because it is not naturally inclined towards colonialism, is ideally suited to being a leader in that work.  I would be interested in witnesses&rsquo; comments on that point.  I have other questions but that is probably enough for now. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400007#F00200","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1391524800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I welcome the panel here today.  Mr. Connolly mentioned neutrality.  The Minister for Defence told the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, review publication last year that neutrality is an outdated concept.  Is that idea floating around Europe?  Mr. Connolly spoke about the blend of force, development aid and diplomacy.  The plans discussed at the last European Council meeting could see increased spending on weapons and arms by EU member states including this State.  Will that float in this State, given our neutrality?  Is there sense in such a policy?<\/p><p>  The European Parliament recently voted on a report that noted with regret that the EU does not possess a permanent military planning and conduct capability.  Our MEPs supported that view.  The document defends excessive military spending.  This committee talks about promoting Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the EU and its relationship with the Commission and the Parliament.  Dr. Brennan spoke about the scrutiny of legislation.  Does he think we should consider some of the reports that go through the European Parliament too, such as the one I mentioned? <\/p> <p> Moving on from the role of MEPs, what is the current state of play with regard to engagement between Departments, permanent representations and MEPs?  We cannot force the hands of MEPs as they are members of particular political parties and groupings within the Parliament but is there co-ordination?<\/p><p> The civic education of young people was mentioned.  Last week the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, announced that politics and society will be an examinable subject for the leaving certificate examinations.

It is his view that a good part of that needs to focus on European integration, European politics and making sure there is more of an understanding of European institutions and how they work.<\/p><p> Senator Catherine Noone mentioned the Constitutional Conventional.  A previous convention considered reducing the voting age.  We talk about referenda turnouts and lack of understanding.  Does Dr. O'Brennan think that this European aspect in the politics and society module, which will be coming on stream, would help?

I apologise for my late arrival, having got delayed on the way, as I would like to have heard the presentations.  In am very interested in the question posed by the Chairman.  It is relevant and probably the most pertinent, and one that is on all our minds, that is, the question of the recapitalisation of the banks and how we are likely to fare.  At the top of our agenda here is the whole issue of job creation.  Nobody in the room needs any supporting arguments around that issue.  It is a no brainer, it is what we have to be about.  In that context, is the support for the youth guarantee scheme adequate, is more forthcoming and are we in a position to get it up and running?  Can Europe do more to get job creation programmes in place?  Is there more potential within ECB-ESM funding than we are fully exploiting from that perspective?  In other words, are we doing enough on the domestic front, is enough being done in Europe and can more be done?  There is nothing to bridge the democratic deficit, which is Dr. O'Brennan's area based on Senator Kathryn Reilly's question.  He referred to a disconnect and that the best way to address it would be the creation of the perception in this country that Europe was proactive in the jobs area and could be relevant in the regard.<br \/>I would welcome a comment on the possibility of a UK exit.  It would appear that momentum is gathering.  Is Dr. O'Brennan optimistic that it can be halted?  I would like to believe we will be fit to prevent the UK's exit and that ultimately it will not happen.  Can we prevent it and, if not, what then, given that we have 50% of our trade with the UK and given the position of Northern Ireland?  My constituency and that of Senator Kathryn Reilly staddle the Border.  It would have enormous implications and would set the clock back were it to happen.  <br \/>We are all aware from our televisions of what was happening in the Ukraine recently.  There was an inevitability that as we push east and close to the Russian borders, Russia would react.  It was hardly going to let us push in as far as Moscow in terms of western influence, trade links and so on without reacting and it is reacting in the Ukraine case.  Could it be argued that we over-did it, that we pushed too tight or that we did not proceed by process, that we did it to the detriment of the lives of the people in the Ukraine and as a result, caused a combustion and anarchy almost, with no alternative government?  That is a very serious question for the people who have to live there. <br \/>I know I am straying off to another issue but I will finish on this.  I read a very interesting article by Tom McGurk in the <i>Sunday Business Post <\/i>last Sunday suggesting that energy needs and energy strategies are changing all the time and questioning our hypothesis that all or much of our energy policy is currently predicated on the premise that we will be exporting energy to a UK market.  He questions that premise and said that because it is likely to get involved in the same strategies as the US in regard to shale and fracking, etc., we are unlikely to have an export market in the UK.  Have the witnesses any thoughts on that issue?  Is there a cohesive energy policy or strategy evolving in Europe as nuclear power changes?  Is there a need to look at energy policy at a European level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400008#G00300","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1391525400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly.

However, we do not live in an ideal world.  While I accept many of the contributions made, many are predicated upon resources and reform within the State itself.  For example, we are theoretically addressing the review of foreign policy and external relations.  How does one create a policy around those two issues?  Some have said it is important to relate to the people who put us here, the people must relate to Europe, we must go back into the schools and we must educate the politicians.  It is a sobering fact and it is not a popular one for a politician to say it.  There are about 226 politicians in this complex.  We struggle as a small committee as do other committees.  The representation is four people today.  We struggle to create a quorum.  We drag people in who happen to be passing by in the corridor and so on.  As soon as they come in, the meeting starts and they leave.<\/p><p>  On the questions the witnesses are posing to us - how does one build on what has been achieved so successfully to date, and on Ireland's role among the 28 member states in the European Union?  I challenge them to say that, theoretically, they are telling us how to go about it but, in practice, it will be very different.  Perhaps I can draw a comparison.  If we have closed the three embassies on the grounds of economic inability to sustain them and we have now decided, during this public debate on the review of foreign policy and external relations, to open five embassies and three consulate generals, that will all happen out of the existing budget.  There is not an extra cent in the budget for this increased representation.  Dr. O'Brennan mentioned the importance of retaining the embassy relationship at each of the 28 member states.  I understand that Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, three adjoining countries, have diminishing populations while one of them, Lithuania, has been targeted for a reduction in services.<\/p> <p>There will be a presence in Jakarta and the embassy to the Holy See is to be reopened.  It does not make economic sense to be opening embassies on the ground while ostensibly not increasing the budget.  The arguments that we are being asked to engage in would require substantial investment in the budget.<\/p><p> Mr. Proinsias De Rossa mentioned sovereignty, which has been kicked about a few times today.  Will he compare the arguments for our position and the counter argument that we play a wonderful role and are highly sought as an independent non-aligned country which engages in the depths of Africa, be it Sierra Leone and further afield.  We are uncontaminated because we are not deemed to be affiliated to some power bloc.<\/p><p> I would argue that we must reform the institution of the State before we can be sufficiently empowered to develop the argument that has been made today.  We are very proud of what we are doing as a country.  Could the delegation offer an opinion as to who got it so wrong about the Ukraine and Armenia, where everybody, including the Chairman, was convinced from listening to one side of the argument in Ukraine?  As a western State, have we neglected and not fully understood the complexities of Ukraine; that we have been looking at it as two nations and that we were playing to was the western half of the country?  Did the High Representative, Catherine Ashton or the external action services get it so completely wrong?  If Ukraine implodes, there are very serious ramifications for the rest of the European project.<\/p><p> I understand the Minister is at one with us when he states he has been in Albania and the Albanians are coming on board, and the same with Moldova.  The eastern partnership region started to come unstuck when the Russian Federation, engaging with Armenia, pulled Armenia out of the sphere of influence it was trying to head.  Everybody is shocked by the situation that has blown up in Ukraine.  Are we that divorced from our understanding of the country?  Is our knowledge of the region so unsophisticated that we fail to see the terrible potential in terms of what is already happening?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400008#G00500","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391526000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.  I too apologise for my late arrival.  I have a range of questions.  As I understand the brief it is not necessary to look at EU policy in detail but rather to look specifically at the promotion of Ireland's interest in the European Union and to ensure Europe's voice is strong at a global level.<\/p><p>  I have already raised this question with Ms Catherine Day when she came before us.  We are moving very quickly towards a much more robust economic and monetary union but the social agenda of Europe of the People seems to have been left behind.  We have much closer involvement at governmental level but as Senator Noone has said, it is doubtful if one would find a single person out of 300 people on Grafton Street who could list all the members of the European Union.  We are galloping very quickly in one direction but we are also galloping very quickly in another.  Is there an inconsistency?  We have an idea that the voice of Ireland is heard in Europe, but should we not be looking at the voice of the Irish people being heard in Europe?  Are we loosing to some extent the ability to hear the voice of the people of Europe?<\/p><p>  My second question relates to the use of our resources for the best effect.  Another point Ms Catherine Day made on the scrutiny of EU legislation was that we should focus our effort and identify those areas where we have influence and can exert our influence on European affairs rather than taking a scatter-gun approach.  To what extent is that also the case with our engagement with other member states?  Are we focusing enough on bilateral engagement?  I am conscious for the sake of argument that  as Mr. Connelly said, we have moved closer to the northern European model and distanced ourself from Greece.  Our strategy in the late 1980s and the 1990s was the opposite, it was to create bilateral engagement with the other peripheral countries, where there was a sense of a shared range of difficulties that also reflected Ireland's difficulties as a peripheral country.  Should we be doing more to develop bilateral relations with EU countries that perhaps are closer to the model of difficulty that we are facing rather than wanting to be up there on the economic and monetary scale with the Northern European good boys?<\/p><p>  My next question is whether monetary and fiscal affairs dominate the agenda in the EU.  We seem to be quite effective in negotiating that.  I am conscious of a speech that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, made in the D&aacute;il about moving to a new style of diplomacy, in which we would move away from the current entrance examination for third secretaries as a means of recruiting people to the diplomatic corps to a new style of ensuring the Department of Finance engaged on the diplomatic level.  To what extent has that change worked?  Should we be moving to a cross-departmental approach to diplomacy?  Are we already there and I have not noticed?<\/p><p>  To what extent could the European Union be facing enlargement not from recruiting new member states, but by increased nationalism among some of the older democracies?  For the sake of argument, if the referendum on Scottish independence is successful in September what implications will it have on other areas of Europe in which there have been movements toward separatism for many years but with which we have strong areas of national identification?  In particular I am considering  the challenge Ireland might face if Scotland is successful in achieving independence.  The opinion polls indicate it is not looking that likely but much can change in the course of a campaign in the next six months.  If that were to be the case, and Scotland achieved its independence, it might have an impact on the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership as Scotland tends to be more pro-European than the rest of the UK.  Would Scotland automatically stay as a member of the European Union if the United Kingdom were to leave the Union or would it be seeking to join the Union behind Serbia?  What happens in that scenario and what impact would that have on our interests in peace on the island of Ireland and Northern Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400009#H00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1391526600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Thank you.

The Chairman asked about my suggestion that the committee should consider hearings or a hearing for the nominee to the Commission.  This should also be considered for other matters, which I will touch on.  He asked whether this would lead to a circus.  It seems to me, from observing the D&aacute;il over the past couple of years, that the committee system in the D&aacute;il has matured enormously and there have been quite a number of hearings on very technical and, indeed, highly volatile subjects that have been remarked upon as a model of how it should be done.  I believe that provided such a hearing is structured to ensure the questioning relates to the criteria required of a Commissioner, there should not be any problem.<\/p><p>  From participating in hearings, I know that what is done in the Parliament is the political groups produce a list of questions they would like to have put to the nominee.  Given the size of the Parliament, one also has to nominate the people who will put the questions, and time is allocated and so on.  It is a highly structured affair but it is very effective.  I would instance the fact that M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, who was nominated as Commissioner by the last Government, did exceptionally well in the hearings and has proven to be a good Commissioner in terms of doing the job she was sent out to do.  To quote Article 17.3 of the Lisbon treaty, it states: \"The members of the Commission shall be chosen on the ground of their general competence and European commitment from persons whose independence is beyond doubt\".  Therefore, independence, competence and commitment to the objectives of the European Union are the issues, not whether, if they were former Ministers, Deputies or Senators, they let this or that one down, or whatever.  That is out of order.  The questions relate to competence and independence.  A good question would be, \"Will they act independently of all governments, including the Irish Government?\", which is key to the collegiality of the Commission.  I have no doubt this committee could do that. <\/p><p>  The issue of the Presidency of the Commission is equally important.  A new system is coming into place this year whereby, under the treaty, the Council has to consult with the Parliament about who it wants for President of the Commission.  That is completely new and has not been the case before.  As a consequence of that, virtually all of the political groups in the Parliament are putting forward a nominee for the Presidency of the Commission.  Martin Schulz has been put forward by the Socialist group, of which I was a member, and Guy Verhofstadt is being put forward by the Liberal group, of which Fianna F&aacute;il is a member.  I do not know who the EPP nominee is at this point - it may be the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, for all I know.  However, the point is that we need a commitment from all of the governments.<\/p><p>  We are concerned here with the Irish situation.  We need a commitment from the Irish Government that it will insist this is done, and that the Council will not go in behind closed doors and make its own choice, have a few perfunctory consultations with the Parliament and then just disclose the name.  If that is the case, the likelihood is that, no matter how good the person is, if it does not reflect the vote of the people in the elections, the person will be rejected and we will have a crisis.  It is very important this is addressed.<\/p><p>  We touched on the identification of MEPs, which is a perennial problem.  It is not so much a problem for councillors or Deputies because they are on the ground all the time and live in their areas.  MEPs spend four weeks of the month, 11 months of the year, not on the ground.  They are dependent to a large extent on what the media has to say about them, and in most cases the media has nothing to say about them, good, bad or indifferent.  We would be delighted if they would attack us occasionally just to get a bit of attention - I am speaking in the past, of course.  I can recall speaking in the Seanad on the European Convention and what was being proposed in the draft treaty.  I think I was the first MEP ever to speak in the Seanad but there was not a single word in any of the national print media or RTE.  It is not that I particularly wanted it, but I thought that, as an event, it would have been something of significance, given it was the first attempt at the Lisbon treaty.<\/p><p>  On the issue of substitutes, the last thing we need are European Parliament by-elections, which would be horrendous.  Therefore, either there is a substitute or we go for the full-on list system.  One reform might be that the name of the substitute would be printed on the ballot paper, which would make it very long but would in some way let the electorate, which will vote for its preferred candidate, know they are also voting for B, C, D and E as well.<\/p><p>  Senator Kathryn Reilly raised the question of voting in the European Parliament.  There are anything up to 1,000 votes a week in the Parliament in Strasbourg on all the different sections.  There can be an objection to a particular paragraph or line in a report which might run to ten pages.  If MEPs agree broadly with the report, they vote for the report, although they may have an exception to that point.  Therefore, I would not take a vote for a final report as a vote for a particular dimension of that report, as one would need to dig more to see if there was any explanation of votes and what the MEPs did to signal their unhappiness with it.  I have to say that sometimes, because there are 1,000 votes, MEPs vote for some things that, if they knew they were there, they would not vote for.  That is the reality as well, because they are only human.<\/p><p>  I will leave it at that, although there are many other issues I could touch on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400010#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Proinsias De Rossa"},{"type":"speech","time":1391526600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Thank you.

The Chairman asked about enlargement and earlier about diplomatic representation, which links to Deputy Byrne's question.  The key question is where the value is added in the international representation.  For me, it is about, first, economics and trade, and, second, about alliances in Brussels and how we construct and sustain those alliances over time.<\/p><p>  In terms of the budgetary question, we have to make choices.  I believe there is ample room to make a political choice.  If the argument is that there is value added in engaging in representation in X country, that can and should be done.  If one can demonstrate clearly that having representation in Lithuania potentially has benefits when it comes to a complex EU negotiation of one kind or another, one has to maintain that.  I believe there was a particularly poor decision in that case.<\/p> <p> Equally, it is regrettable that the embassy in Iran has closed.  Iran is an important country, as the Chairman pointed out, with a large population that has gradually been brought into the diplomatic process, partly through Ms Catherine Ashton's vigorous diplomacy last autumn.  There are real opportunities attaching to the normalisation of Iran geopolitcally.  We may come to regret that particular decision and the decision in regard to Lithuania.  Such decisions are made within the bounded contexts I have referred to, economic and otherwise, but we would do well to reflect on the suggestions put forward by Professor Tonra last month.  These include using secondments and short-term contracts to buttress the capacities we have in individual member states, particularly on important issues like agriculture, for instance, if it is France or Spain.  Another important issue is the necessity of watching the legislative cycle very closely.<\/p><p> The second question was about enlargement and my rather pessimistic view of the current landscape.  I am at odds with some of the members on these issues.  The agreement between Serbia and Kosovo last April has been asserted as the breakthrough that was needed because it has implications that go beyond those two states.  It certainly was a success for Ms Ashton and the European External Action Service, EEAS, but we should not come to the conclusion that it represents a decisive break in the logjam.  There are many issues that feed into the phenomenon of fatigue.  One is the perception that Bulgaria and Romania entered the EU prematurely - I disagree with it, but it is a view that is widespread.  Another factor is the economic crisis, particularly what has happened to Greece.  The Balkans is partly viewed through that prism, because of its proximity to Greece.  There are ongoing problems in the western Balkans, particularly in Bosnia, which is, in many senses, an embryonic state that refuses to become a state proper.  There is also a sense that we went too far too fast.<\/p><p> Looking at the support or otherwise for enlargement in key national capitals, it is clear there has been a decisive change.  The United Kingdom, for example, was always, for different reasons, a champion of further expansion, including to Turkey.  Now it seems to have gone completely cold on further expansion.  Recent comments by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, suggesting that the question of the western Balkans might potentially be held hostage to the immigration debate were disgraceful and represent a very decisive change in the landscape.  Similarly, the manner in which the Bundestag has insinuated itself into the German stance is very much a negative.  When national parliaments effectively hold a veto at every stage of the negotiation, rather than at the end, where the European Parliament effectively has a vote, it becomes very problematic.  Serbia was not able to progress last June because the Germans demanded more evidence of the commitment that is implied in the April agreement.  We have moved forward since then, which is very welcome, but there remain multiple opportunities for the process to be slowed down, which was not the case previously.  It is a cause for concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391527200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>The first issue I will deal with is bank recapitalisation, as raised by several members.  It is important to remember that the Irish State put some &euro;60 billion into the banking sector at a time when there were no instruments available at EU level to help with that process.  The Government's argument ever since has been that because Ireland stepped in to take a hit for the team, as it were, and prevent contagion at European level, we deserve to have some type of retroactive recapitalisation.  The mainstay of the Government's reassurance or comfort was the summit of 28 June 2012 where Ireland was explicitly named in the Council conclusions and implicitly offered some type of support for Irish banks via the European Stability Mechanism.  That has been the Government's foothold ever since.  However, there has been a steady withdrawal from that position at a commentary level by various European politicians, most notably Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, the German Finance Minister.  These comments appear to pour cold water on the prospects of Ireland ever getting a deal on bank debt, principally because of the argument that the State is doing fine, has worked its way out of the programme, is in recovery mode and does not, therefore, need any additional help.<\/p><p>  Having said that, the Government certainly is sticking to its guns and there is a very slow, deliberate and incremental process under way at European Finance Minister level whereby the modalities of a system for the ESM directly recapitalising banks in Europe in a way that would shift the burden away from the sovereign is being worked out.  That process should be completed in the next six weeks or so at official level.  Retrospective capitalisation, which is Ireland's aspiration, would then be handled on a case-by-case basis.  Nothing can happen, however, until the single resolution mechanism is up and running, that is, a system whereby banks can either be shut down or bailed out.  Until that architecture is fully agreed and fully in place and the European Central Bank is acting as the central supervisor, the Irish question will remain somewhat in limbo.  From speaking to various delegations in Brussels, it is clear to me that there is considerable sympathy for Ireland's claim and aspiration and that people have listened to the Government's arguments.  The problem for Germany is that it does not want to concede anything before the final mechanism is totally locked down and agreed; otherwise, it would create a precedent that other countries might want to follow.<\/p><p>  We were asked about neutrality and expenditure on weapons and so on.  I must demur when it comes to my own opinions on neutrality - I have to remain neutral myself as a reporter.  The argument at EU level at this time is very much governed by the decision of the United States to step back from major conflicts around the world, especially in Africa and increasingly in the Middle East, notwithstanding its recent efforts to broker a peace agreement there.  The hard reality for Europe was that when the no fly zone was put in place over Libya, it did not have sufficient airlift and refuelling capacity.  We needed the Americans to step in.  The more the United States steps out of the equation, the more exposed European capabilities will be.  There is an effort at EU level to ensure that the European Defence Agency will at least allow armies to equip themselves in such a way that they are not duplicating resources and wasting money.  It is a sensitive topic in Ireland because of our neutrality, but the reality is that if Europe is going to confront the threats it will face in the next ten to 15 years, especially the situation in the Sahel and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Africa, there is a view that it must invest more in defence.  The reality, of course, is that many countries have been cutting back on defence expenditure during the financial crisis.  The big question for Europe is how that issue can be balanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Connelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1391527200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I apologise to colleagues and witnesses for leaving the meeting.  I had some equally important questions to ask in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  I have said many times that we in this country do not take ownership of Europe.  We are entitled to that, the same as every other European citizen.  There is a tendency throughout Europe for each member state - some member states in particular - to use the opt-out clause and claim that Europe will not agree to a specific proposal.<\/p> <p>They have a contribution to make but they do not always make it.  That is commitment, to which Mr. De Rossa referred.  Social, economic and political cohesion cannot take place unless there is that commitment.  If one or a number of countries opt out, as one major country is effectively doing, then there is no Union.  The Union cannot exist that way.  It would be akin to taking one or two states, such as Texas, out of the United States.  What would happen to the Union is that it would be finished.  <br \/>An aspect we need to remember, which was mentioned by Mr. De Rossa, is the Commission and its competence and capability.  Those in the Commission and the President of the Commission always need to be people who have an overall conception of what the European Union is about and must represent the entire Union.  For example, we have all become accustomed to referring to the Irish Commissioner, which is not a reference to the present Commissioner who, as Mr. De Rossa has said, has done a very good job.  The English Commissioner, the French Commissioner and the German Commissioners, as it used to be, have lost the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>when it comes to that because they are supposed to be the Commissioners of all the community.  A Commissioner can become identified with one or other country.  We contributed to that too because we fought for an Irish Commissioner when, in fact, we should be fighting for a Commissioner to represent the entire Community, including Ireland.  Each individual Commissioner should and must be as familiar with the Irish position and the requirements of this economy as any other part of the European Union and if that does not happen we do not proceed in the way we should. <br \/>Reference has been made to the enlargement issue and the general opposition in some quarters.  To argue that what we have we hold, or we cannot move forward, or it is too soon to move forward, is all rubbish.  There was a need to move forward and to make a decision as to whether emerging democracies should be left to fly on their own, so to speak, to swim in the deep blue water or if there should be some engagement with them to bring into the Community.  They are European neighbours who are entitled to be identified as Europeans.  The same goes for the neighbourhood communities.  The European Union has a large population and should have a persuasive, cohesive and peaceful influence on its neighbours.  That reference has already been made by all the speakers.  If that does not happen we will have missed out.<br \/>My last point is on the ECB.  The ECB was supposed to have done a job.  Effectively, it was supposed to link up with all the other central banks throughout Europe.  There was supposed to be a mechanism whereby each would know what the other was doing, to whom it was doing it, their borrowing and lending capacities and whether they were observing the norms.  Of course, that did not happen or, if it did, the ECB did nothing about it.  The appalling situation that emerged was that the ECB did not function and it was only when the crisis broke that everybody realised at the same time that something should be done about it, and it was done retrospectively.<br \/>I was in the House a few moments ago where I heard a speaker mention the necessity to burn bondholders and to forget about paying back the money that was borrowed.  We forget that all the borrowing here took place under the noses of the Administration - I am not blaming one or the other - the supervisory role of the Central Bank, the regulatory system and the institutions that were supposed to protect the State and, ultimately, the eurozone and the European Union, and nothing happened.  The presumption in some quarters today is that we can withdraw from that area saying, &quot;Sorry, we borrowed that money, it was unfortunate, but we are not giving it back&quot;.  It does not work that way and we would leave ourselves open to serious consequences down the road and a lack of trust that we cannot afford.  I will conclude on the issue of neutrality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400011#K00300","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391527800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400012#L00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1391527800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I have believed for a long time that the ability of the European Union to defend itself has changed and is changing.

It would have very little difficulty in becoming a member but it would then have to decide whether it wanted to join the euro.  One of the big issues in the current debate is that the nationalists in Scotland want to remain part of sterling.  I am not involved in the referendum campaign but based on our experience in Ireland, populations at large generally do not like taking a leap in the dark in referendums.  I may be wrong but I do not see the referendum being carried.  One of the things the European Union has to acknowledge, and given what Deputy Durkan has said, is its relatively tiny size compared to the rest of the world, a declining population, an ageing population and a resistance to migration, all of which lead to a decline, which is an issue we have to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400012#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Proinsias De Rossa"},{"type":"speech","time":1391527800,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I call Dr. O'Brennan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400012#L00600","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391527800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>On the question of the move of European affairs from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Department of the Taoiseach, it is reflective of the wider environment in Europe where departments of the executive in general, and particularly, Prime Ministers offices, have been more empowered at the expense usually of foreign ministries over time.  I do not think the Irish context is that unique.  Prime Ministers have become more assertive within the EU process, perhaps for good reason in the context of the economic crisis and the task of managing it in the immediate timeframes.  There was always a delicate balance in the Irish context between the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach's office was a latter day arrival in some senses, in terms of the relative roles played by all three.  It is far too early to say what the implications will be in the longer run, for the efficiency of our policies and how they are pursued.  It can be argued that the Presidency which, as Mr. Connelly has said, has been universally viewed as a success, suggests that there is more continuity than change.  In other words, as the previous Irish Presidencies were successful, the dynamics of last year's one was very similar.  That suggests it certainly has not been a negative thing.<\/p><p>  There is some confusion, however, particularly about websites.

Senator Hayden asked about Ireland's bilateral engagement with other countries and if we had ditched countries with which we were more akin to in the light of our experience, such as Greece and Spain, and were moving towards alignment with northern European countries.  I think it is of benefit to Ireland that we are sufficiently pragmatic as it is not necessarily a zero sum game and the Government has managed to navigate different viewpoints and different camps in Europe.  The reality was that during the bailout we had to decouple ourselves from Greece in order to restore the trust and the attractiveness of the financial markets.  It was an expedient the Government had to follow.  The Government made it almost a virtue that we were not like Greece or Portugal but that we were something different.  That went down rather badly on the streets of Greece.  Certainly at some of the demonstrations that I covered at the time there was some resentment towards Ireland for its cavalier attitude, as it was perceived at the time, but having gone through the EU-IMF programme the Government is in the vanguard of reform, partly through choice because the policy choices that Ireland made had been embarked upon before the EU-IMF programme started.  We are seen as in the vanguard of reform and the Government will want to stay the course.<\/p><p>  I think Ireland has been very successful in keeping bilateral relations solid.  It is the same chemistry that people talk about in Brussels - the Irish diplomats' ability to put people at their ease, their ability to blend business and pleasure.  That is a gift that successive governments have and they would do well to keep hold of those gifts. <\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne raised the question of Ukraine.  There is a debate in Europe as to whether Europe lost Ukraine rather than Russia winning Ukraine.  The problems that people are declaiming on the streets of Kiev are the exact same problems and frustrations that accompanied the orange revolution ten years ago.  The frustrations that ordinary people have about the rule of law, the brutality of the police and corruption have not gone away.  They are being repeated.  The European Union was in a very difficult position.  It could not offer full membership to Ukraine but had to offer some kind of half way perspective that would sufficiently reassure the population of Ukraine without alienating Russia but there is no doubt that once the eight Eastern Europe states joined the European Union and joined NATO, the Russian Federation under Vladimir Putin was going to be on the defensive.  Ukraine occupies a place in the former Russian imperial soul that means that it is something the Russian government will not give up easily.  It is an intractable problem.  One could argue that diplomatically not enough attention was paid to the other part of Ukraine, as Deputy Byrne said, that it was left on a one way street, in terms of bringing the government and the people of Ukraine in a more European direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014020400013#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Connelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1391528400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>My question asked who led us up the garden path.

As today's meeting is being broadcast live on the Oireachtas channel I would appreciate if everybody would switch off their mobile telephones.<\/p><p>  Usually the first item on the agenda is the minutes of the previous meeting but today I shall deal with them after we meet the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD.  I welcome all of the delegation.  We normally do not meet until Wednesday afternoon so members have travelled here on a Tuesday morning especially to meet the delegation and hear about this important review that takes place every four years.  I am delighted to see an all-woman forum in attendance.  It is not too often that we see one and we are delighted to have the delegation.  <\/p><p>  We are all aware of the work done by Irish Aid which is primarily aimed at reducing poverty and hunger in sub-Saharan Africa.  We are rightly proud of the efforts of Irish Aid and also the work of the development assistance committee of the OECD.  <\/p> <p>It enables the effectiveness of our aid programme to be measured.  The next DAC peer review is due to be published in October.  Today's meeting is a timely opportunity for an exchange of views with members of the committee, which will be very useful.  The format of today's meeting will be a presentation by the Development Assistance Committee, followed by questions from the members.  <\/p><p> I welcome Ms Karen Jorgensen and Ms Ida McDonnell from the OECD, Ms Maria Paula Marques Faria de Barro and Ms Ana Paula Lopes Fernandes from Portugal and Ms Egl&eacute; Bloznien&eacute; from Lithuania.  I know they are receiving good co-operation from our officials in Irish Aid.  As I said, we have a very good aid programme, of which we are very proud.  The committee travels abroad to visit some of the programme countries and we have seen at first hand the excellent work done by Irish Aid and our NGOs, of which we are very proud.

It is a pleasure to be here today.  By way of giving members a little bit of background to the reviews, they may know the OECD conducts country reviews in a wide range of policy areas.  The organisation and its Development Assistance Committee place high priority on the reviews we do in the area of development co-operation.  The committee has 29 members and two of the members always review a third country.  This time Ireland is being reviewed by Austria and Portugal, and the representatives of Portugal are here today.  When we review the aid programme, we look at all aspects of how Ireland conducts its development co-operation.  We also look forward to issuing some recommendations for consideration by the Government about how it might improve its performance in the aid programme.<\/p><p>  We have two main objectives.  The first objective is accountability, namely, to hold the Government to account for international commitments undertaken and also for the commitments it set out in its own domestic policy.  The second objective is to foster mutual learning because we believe there is great value in members learning from each other.  We certainly believe Ireland has a good programme with much of the thinking behind it, from which other members could benefit.<\/p><p>  We consult a broad range of stakeholders in conducting the review.  We talk not only to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which is the main partner, but also to other Departments, partner countries, civil society, opinion leaders and, very importantly, Members of Parliament who vote on the budgets and on the policy direction and, to a large extent, who steer the programme politically.  We would really welcome hearing from them how they see the programme being implemented.<\/p><p>  We will spend one week in Dublin and one week in Malawi where we will also meet a wide range of stakeholders, including members of Malawi's parliament.  It will culminate with a meeting in Paris in October where the Development Assistance Committee will discuss the report we put forward as the team.<\/p><p>  We are really grateful for the opportunity to hear members' views on the work of the Irish Aid programme and we hope we can have a lively engagement with them.

The Chairman referred to the need for public support for the programme.  In challenging economic times, this country continues to provide a very substantial aid programme.  The taxpayers and the public at large need to know that money is being put to good use.  Syria is the humanitarian crisis of this generation and it was most disappointing that the international community failed to make sufficient pledges at the recent humanitarian pledging conference.  One of the issues mentioned to us all the time is that where humanitarian assistance is sought in times of crisis, it often does not get to the people most in need.  Maybe that is not directly under the delegation's remit but it is an issue which should always be at the forefront of our minds, that is, that humanitarian assistance gets to the people most in need.<\/p><p>  Is there any country whose aid programme appears to deliver better results than those of other countries?

I am familiar with the committee's oversight role.  My understanding is Portugal and Austria are the two partners that will review Ireland's overseas development aid programme and Malawi is being taken as the counter country.  How were Austria and Portugal chosen?  What is the relationship between these countries?  Are OECD staff in those countries?  What is the relationship within them <i>vis-&aacute;-vis<\/i>the other team that will accompany these staff for two weeks in Malawi?  I would like to clarify this organisational question.<br \/>Reference was made to the importance of this committee.  We sanction the ODA budget and, unfortunately, we also cut it on occasions.  It has reduced from 0.7% of GDP to less than 0.5%.  However, there are historical and economic reasons for that.<br \/>Has the OECD a vision of how to best use development aid?  We pride ourselves in Ireland on being a small country doing a good job but we do not have oversight of projects that are being funded, which we think are great.  When Ireland and its work in Malawi is compared to that of other OECD members, how are conclusions drawn in the context of the organisation's vision about the success or failure of our programme?<br \/>Uganda is a great example of where the Government stepped in quickly when it discovered fraud by the prime minister's office amounting to &euro;3 million.  We also pride ourselves that the fraud was exposed by virtue of the fact that Irish Aid had been assisting a department within the office.  That is a great example of how aid is effective because ultimately &euro;9 million was saved with two other affected donor countries also providing &euro;3 million each.  Aside from the traditional provision of aid for natural disasters, hunger and so on, has the OECD a vision as to how aid should best be distributed or implemented?  Rather than feeding the hungry at the side of the road as part of a charitable, aid assisted programme of the government, investment should be made in infrastructure.  If there is massive corruption in countries, ODA will dissipate.  Should the corruption not be tackled?  Should governments be assisted at local and national level where they are weak?  Many of these countries are emerging from wars or other friction.  If hunger is the perennial problem, should aid be provided for food production methods, education and water treatment to reduce the need for aid for those who repeatedly fall sick from dysentery and so on?  <br \/>The UN is preparing its post-2015 vision for development aid.  Has the OECD a vision and does the organisation want us to conform to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014020400004#C00500","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1391512200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for attending.  I am surprised there is not a ranking.  Why not?  Do some OECD members not want it because they might be embarrassed by it?  In business, as in any organisation, if it is not being measured, it is not being done.  Perhaps the OECD will consider this point.<\/p><p>  According to the delegation's analysis, some countries give aid that is tied to their trade policy.  In other words, they will give aid if the recipient country buys its products.  That is trade rather than aid.  Is that taken into account in reviews?<\/p><p>  In the context of aid, for every dollar that is given to developing countries by the EU and others, it is estimated they lose three dollars because of the trade policies of First World countries.  Has analysis been conducted on how that affects development?  I refer to EU trade policy, although this is not within the delegation's remit.  When developing such a policy with Colombia, a human rights clause was inserted but there is no trigger mechanism.  Nobody has ever explained to us how that would happen.<\/p><p>  Ireland's ODA contribution has reduced because of our economic circumstances but we are tied to giving 0.7% of funding to various EU initiatives.<\/p> <p>No matter what the EU initiative is we must give 0.7% of it.  The amount of money available for our bilateral aid programme and for our NGOs such as Concern, Tr&oacute;caire, GOAL and others under D&oacute;chas, and many other organisations, is dropping substantially because we are tied to giving 0.7% to all these EU programmes.  We must give hundreds of millions of euro over five years for particular programmes.  What is the witnesses' view of that?  We give a very large headline figure which reduces the amount we have as a country in discretionary allocation to bilateral aid programmes and to our NGOs, which badly need them.<\/p><p> When people consider our aid programme they consider the work done by our NGOs, our work in Malawi and other partner countries but that accounts for only a small proportion of our money.  Most of our money is committed to the EU.  We have no control over what happens to it after it leaves our coffers.  Ironically, we borrow most of that money from the EU in the first place.  I would like to get the witnesses&rsquo; views on those issues.  I am sorry that I cannot stay to hear the answers but I will be able to read them in the Official Report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014020400004#C00600","speaker":"1159","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391512800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>There are several questions from two members, Deputy Eric Byrne and Senator Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014020400005#D00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391512800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I will address the organisational issues that Deputy Byrne raised.  As a member of the committee a country is obliged to undergo peer reviews roughly every five years.  It is also obliged to serve as an examiner of another country, roughly every two years.  Every year I know which countries are due for a review.  I schedule them in and consider which countries are due to be examiners and try to match up members that can serve as good and appropriate examiners of the country to be examined.  That was not very eloquent but I hope the committee gets the point.  In this case Austria and Portugal were on the list of countries to be examiners this year and we felt that they had programmes of a similar size to Ireland&rsquo;s, that they were engaging in similar topics, had similar interests and could learn a lot from each other.  That was my rationale for suggesting to the committee that Austria and Portugal examine Ireland, and that was accepted.<\/p><p>  Another question was how we define best practice.  Some committee members have the reference guide for peer or country reviews which sets out seven dimensions of performance against which we think we should measure the member.  While it does not attach numerical or quantitative values that would allow a more specific ranking there is in fact an implicit ranking because we have indicators.  We started to apply this a year ago.  It gives us a better comparator between our members because we now review them against the same set of indicators.  <\/p><p>  In answer to the question about how we judge delivery of aid in countries, first, our point of departure in examining a country is the commitments that it has made.  The basis for our review of Ireland is the 2006 White Paper, supplemented by the more recent One World, One Future because they are the policy instruments that set out what Ireland would like to see being achieved.  It is very important that countries work in areas where they feel they have a comparative advantage, where they can add something specifically to the development of their partner countries, that they focus on countries where they have a presence, where they understand the context very well, where they have established good partnerships because all of those factors will be key to successful delivery of an aid programme. <\/p><p>  I will leave my answer there and turn to the representatives of Portugal to answer the more specific questions related also to the EU. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014020400005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Jorgensen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391512800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions.  I hope we will have time to hear their views on certain topics because that is also part of our objective at this meeting.<\/p><p>  Ireland peer-reviewed us in 2009.  We were very pleased with the team and had the opportunity to exchange some ideas.  We are now very pleased to be on this side of the table.  This is an exercise in peer learning and discussion about challenges and opportunities and how we do things.  It is not just an exercise in criticism.  It is an exercise in being critical, helpful, very respectful and understanding the policy environment in each country.  That is our attitude as examiners.  The committee is a peer-learning committee.  It is not a ranking committee.  That is not the spirit of the committee.  For example, we do not have a programme of development co-operation for Portugal in Malawi but I happen to know the country very well.  Each of us on the team has a particular expertise in certain areas that could be helpful for the team in addressing the topics that we must address.<\/p><p>  It is very difficult to compare what different donors do because they do not all work in the same countries or have the same objectives.  Some focus on least-developed countries, LDCs, others on middle-income countries, some are grant-oriented where others are loan or concession-oriented.

In the peer review we must also assess the results.  I was saying that if there are only two countries working, for instance, on Guinea-Bissau how can one rank them <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>countries such as Mozambique where 19 countries work.  It is a completely different setting if one is working on fragility or on a country that has a different consistency for development, even in education.  For ranking purposes, one is interested in the support for the millennium development goals, MDGs.  That involves targets.  We work more on targets and whether the country is performing <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>those targets.  We have commitments on tying.  Are we performing on the commitments that we have agreed on tying?  There is a ranking there.  We have commitments on LDCs, for example, how much of our aid should go to LDCs <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the total amount of aid.  Are we performing there and where are we ranking there?  We have particular rankings for particular international agreements to which we have subscribed as a community of donors, as governments, broadly speaking.  When we make these commitments we have rankings.  There is data from the OECD that can be assessed because it is public and transparent.  The OECD is very clear on that type of recommendation.  It might be difficult to have a ranking based on the general performance of the donor.<br \/>We have commitments and rankings on tying and many recommendations.  That is part of what we assess also in peer reviews.  We consider the overall importance that the government gives to human rights, in cross-cutting issues in its development policies. <\/p> <p> On the question about the way we are or are not following statistics, I happen to also be the facilitator of the working party on statistics, which is the body in the Development Assistance Committee, DAC, that is responsible for managing statistics.  We have rules that were agreed between the European countries and the EU to avoid double counting.  We do not have double counting in statistics in terms of reporting what each donor is doing under the EU framework and what that donor is doing as an individual, bilateral donor.  The contributions for the EU are also assessed against these principles and recommendations, as I said, so they are part of the whole picture, as the EU, and then we, as the EU governments, have agreements with them.  When we discuss the revision of the European Development Fund, for example, we may say what we would like the European Development Fund to do.<\/p><p> We can always improve the accountability system but I believe that is a discussion we will probably have to have in Brussels, among the EU members.  It does not really relate to the purpose of the discussions we have in the Development Assistance Committee, where we also have other members like the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  We are going a little beyond the European constituency there in that we have five more members joining this year and we also have an outreach strategy that includes Mexico, Chile and Turkey, as OECD members.  Therefore, we are going a little beyond Europe and the EU is just a part of that.  However, we are very careful to avoid double counting and to assess different issues in terms of the overall development statistics.

In Malawi, we were quite surprised because, even though we work in partnership with the Government, those parliamentarians I spoke to knew nothing of Irish Aid, so they certainly were not following Irish Aid or in any way assessing its effectiveness.<\/p><p>  I have a question that follows on from Deputy Byrne's question on best practice.  It probably comes under the Development Assistance Committee's heading of \"Delivery Modalities and Partnerships help deliver Quality Aid\".  When the witnesses go to Malawi, they will see that Irish aid is delivered through NGOs primarily, with supervision.  A number of Irish NGOs are being funded and possibly some international NGOs also.  On the face of it, one would think this is duplication of effort but, in fact, they are all dealing with different aspects of what is our really excellent programme there - in my view, it is a very impressive food nutrition programme.  It seems there is potential for drawing on the different expertise of the different NGOs but also for automatic peer review and peer learning.  From the perspective of the Development Assistance Committee, is there an international best practice model of how aid should be delivered in that way through NGOs or through a multiplicity of NGOs?  Perhaps it is a difficult question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014020400006#E00300","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1391513400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Thank you.

In addition, we want them to take an interest in engaging with their own government about where aid is coming in and where the government is spending that aid.<\/p><p>  In other countries, however, the parliamentarians are very well informed and engage quite extensively with us about the performance of the aid programme and, indeed, we hear their views, just as we like to hear the views of this committee's members with regard to Irish aid.

We have been working on this issue for the past three years in our team, drawing out some of the lessons we have seen coming from our reviews of how governments, as donors, and NGOs, whether they are based in the donor country or in developing countries, work most efficiently together to deliver development and to have a development impact.<\/p><p>  It is interesting to know that some $19 billion a year of ODA is channelled to or through NGOs.  These are predominantly the northern NGOs - the Concerns, Tr&oacute;caires and Oxfams of this world - and a large share of this money is for humanitarian assistance.  It makes sense in some ways that, as deliverers of humanitarian assistance, the NGOs are involved in that.  They are well co-ordinated through the UN agencies responsible for delivering humanitarian assistance, and there are modalities around this that are quite effective.<\/p><p>  Clearly, a large amount of money is involved and the members of the Development Assistance Committee have not come up with a recommended best practice for how donors should engage with civil society organisations.  However, based on a lot of consultation with the organisational equivalents of D&oacute;chas in the OECD member countries and the responsible people in the aid agencies, we carried out a survey and came up with some ideas.  There are three key areas which we believe NGOs and the governments should recognise as important with regard to being more effective and efficient in delivering.  First, there is an important role for consultation around policies and good practices so NGOs and governments actually talk to each other, dialogue and listen.  Second, NGOs have a comparative advantage in being close to the ground, and they can raise some of the needs that are important to be addressed through the policies.  Third, the funds and modalities need to be looked at carefully.<\/p><p>  We have different ranges of size in the NGO sector, which is probably why there are no recommendations on how best to work with NGOs, so one would match the way an NGO is funded to its capacity to deliver and to absorb resources.  A condition on the funding to the northern NGOs would be that they work with the developing country NGOs, and there is a large capacity building dimension through that, so it is not really a channelling of aid to other northern bodies.  We have seen that one can provide programme-based financing to NGOs which have very good reputations through due diligence and can demonstrate capacity to deliver because they have good priorities on hunger, basic needs and so on.  Then, there is the ear-marked funding, where one tries to have synergies between the donor's aid programme and using the NGOs to help deliver that aid programme.  We are now attaching more and more results to the frameworks for engaging with these NGOs and they must be able to report back on results.  This comes with a warning that one also needs to be sensitive to the nature of their work, in that one cannot quantify everything and it is long-term work, in order that one does not skew their projects on the basis of setting up short-term indicators that will not necessarily have a development impact over the long term.<\/p><p>  Those are some of our lessons.  It is a very complex and diverse world of civil society and NGOs.  A minimum of $20 billion of ODA annually is going through NGOs and the question of the accountability of NGOs arises.  They are working on that together at EU level, they are part of Busan and there is the CSO development group.<\/p> <p>That is their area of work, which they must develop themselves.  It is not up to individual governments to tell them how to develop their accountability.  Having said that, development NGOs are generally very advanced in their accountability mechanisms because their fund-raising efforts tend to bring them very close to the public.  Over the years, they have demonstrated good practice in terms of their transparency in dispensing aid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014020400006#E00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Ida McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391514000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.

As a member of this committee and as chairman of the Irish section of the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, I have had the opportunity to visit a number of African countries.  What impresses one very forcibly is the changing nature of the aid relationship.  It is no longer simply a case of donor and receiver, with a number of African countries now moving into the middle-income groups internationally.  Will the delegates' review take account of that changing relationship?<\/p><p>  When it comes to comprehensive development, coherence is important.  I have referred on several occasions to the dilemma that arises in terms of the food hunger versus biofuels debate.  Another issue of concern is that we are increasingly seeing food being treated as a commodity for the market, something which people can make money out of as opposed to the idea of it being primarily about meeting people's needs.  I am interested to hear the delegates' views on that.<\/p><p>  I was delayed this morning because I was meeting with a delegation of parliamentarians from the Arab spring countries who were invited over to Ireland by AWEPA.  One of the issues that has emerged very forcibly from our engagement is the importance of fair and balanced trade partnerships, which inevitably raises the question of tax justice.  We all know about illicit capital flight and there has been some progress made with the extractive industries.  This issue must be a priority.  What is the point of our giving aid to countries when they are losing their financial resources because of tax evasion by multinational companies?<\/p><p>  Human rights issues are a frequent subject of discussion in this committee.  Where we have an economic trade agreement with a country, the very least we should require is an assurance that workers have decent working conditions and other basic rights.  I am not saying we should go in and tell people what to do in their own country.  We can, however, be a strong voice, in a non-threatening and non-aggressive way, on the issue of human rights internationally.  The reality is that we are trading with countries which have appalling records in the area of human rights.  We cannot simply close our eyes to that reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014020400007#F00400","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1391514000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Jorgensen to respond to that group of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014020400007#F00500","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391514000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleagues to help me with some of the questions.  Senator Mullins asked whether our review will consider both long-term development and humanitarian assistance.  The answer is very much \"Yes\".  Component No. 7 in our reference guide deals specifically with humanitarian assistance.  We have a strong focus in the review of Ireland on how the State responds to fragile and vulnerable situations.  That is a major focus for Ireland.  It is often the case that a long-term development relationship arises out of what was initially a humanitarian assistance intervention, as was the case in Sierra Leone and Liberia some years ago.  In those cases the assistance programme evolved into a reconstruction effort and subsequently a partnership with a longer-term development perspective.  Part of our work is to examine how our members deliver their humanitarian assistance.  Typically, we look to see whether they are working in a co-ordinated way with, for instance, the United Nations, the Red Cross and other pooled funding arrangements which ensure effective delivery of humanitarian assistance.  We also examine whether they are working with local and international NGOs that can be part of the first responders effort.  Some 10% of all overseas development aid goes to humanitarian assistance, so it is very much part of our remit.<\/p><p>  Regarding public support for aid, I would like to turn that question back on the committee, if I may.  The degree of public support for its aid programme is part of our review of Ireland.  We have heard that opinion polls show support levels as high as 80%.  We have been asking questions throughout the week about what it is that secures such a high level of support even in times of economic difficulties.  We have also heard that there is very strong political support for the programme.  We would be grateful for members' perspective on why there is such a high level of public buy-in to the ODA programme and why politicians continue to give it such strong support.  That would give us an important insight.<\/p><p>  Deputy Durkan asked whether we can give an assurance that the moneys received by aid agencies are being well spent.  Part of our job is to examine whether the Irish Aid programme is, in our view, being administered well and in compliance with agreed international principles on the most effective way of delivering aid.  We look in the field to see how well Ireland is co-operating with other donors, which touches on one of the Deputy's other questions.  We are very much concerned with ascertaining whether the member we are reviewing is working in a joined-up way with other donors, participating in collaborative activities and pooled funding, and whether they buy into the recipient Government's programmes, including sector-wide programmes on health or agriculture, which help to ensure the aid is delivered in a co-ordinated way.  My colleagues from Portugal might comment on the new focus in the EU on joint programming in certain priority countries.  This is another way of ensuring the aid effort is co-ordinated as best it can be.<\/p> <p>Therefore, one gets the most from it.<\/p><p> Administrative costs is a tricky issue because we cannot really examine what goes into administrative costs.  However, the countries report to the DAC on their administrative costs.  It is very difficult to compare one country's administrative costs with another's because they work in different development contexts with different modalities.  Some types of aid might be more labour intensive than other types of aid.  Some projects that are quite large can, perhaps, be delivered with lower administrative costs than other, smaller projects that are in very difficult situations.  However, we look at whether the programme is managed in a tight way, whether it has appropriate structures and whether it is staffed with the right technical expertise to be able to deliver the programme that has been designed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014020400007#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Jorgensen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391514600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us.

We have been addressing this in the Development Assistance Committee from the perspective of the policy coherence for development.  We agreed on building blocks in terms of having the institutions really help us to have, first, an all-of-government approach to certain issues and then to address some of the areas where we are not being really supportive of development.  We have been advancing this, but it is an area where we are having some difficulties.<\/p><p>  At the same time, in the OECD we have what we call the development strategy of the OECD.  There we have areas where we thought it would be good to have a more all-of-government approach to certain development issues.  One of the areas in which Ireland is very much engaged is tax and development annual flows.  Other areas relate to environment, gender issues and corruption issues.  What we are trying to perceive in that regard is how can different parts of the government think in a development way and where are the constraints to having a global development that can service all.  What are we doing by our policies that do not enable the others to develop also?  That is the approach we are trying to take.<\/p><p>  We also have a chapter in our review that addresses that coherence approach.  In Portugal, for example, in some years we had an approach to security and development issues, and that takes time.  First, one must put everyone working together.  Then there must be a very strong discussion about the different views.  The most important issue, however, is that in the end one manages to have some impact in the way one is operating as a global actor, and that impact should enable others to perform better.  That relates pretty much to trade tariffs and some agriculture issues which were mentioned.  The OECD has just released the food security PCD document which might also be of interest.  We see that Irish Aid is very attentive to this and the work it is doing with agriculture.  We had some meetings with different line Ministers to discuss this all-over approach.<\/p><p>  I am sorry for taking so long but I wish to add a point on trade jobs and fair trade.  We are conscious of that.  Increasingly, different donors are acknowledging the need to go a little beyond the traditional areas of work and increasing the collaboration with other actors, such as the private sector, to see how we can best help different countries to create jobs and have economic growth.  That is all part of the challenges we will face.  This all links with the post-2015 framework.  In that sense administrative costs are part of some of the discussions we are having in terms of counting aid for the future statistics of development finance.  The Development Assistance Committee is very much linked with the United Nations in this discussion about post-2015 and the finance for development discussion, which also includes these administrative costs and the way we are measuring them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014020400008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ana Paula Lopes Fernandes"},{"type":"speech","time":1391514600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I am glad you mentioned agriculture.

It probably dates back to missionary times when our priests and nuns went abroad to do some great work.  Indeed, on some of our travels we have visited nuns and priests who have been missionaries for 50 years in Africa and have been doing tremendous work in assisting and educating people as well as in the medical profession.  Obviously, those missionaries are scarce now and Irish Aid and Irish NGOs are carrying on their good work.  There is also the response to the graphic television pictures we have seen when there is a tragedy, such as what happened due to the hunger in Somalia and recent events in the Philippines and in other areas.  The Irish seem to respond to these.  We are generous by nature and these graphic pictures obviously touch the hearts of many Irish people.
