The committee has always taken a very strong interest in our industry.  With the Chairman's permission, we will also update members on some of the current issues facing the industry.  I am the chief executive of and Accounting Officer for Horse Racing Ireland, the commercial semi-State body responsible for the development of the thoroughbred horse racing and breeding industries.  I am accompanied by Ms Suzanne Eade, our chief financial officer, and Mr. Jason Morris, our director of racing.<\/p> <p>  Owing to the value of the horse racing industry to Ireland, the State has always taken a strong interest in and legislated for the sector which has been overseen by a State body since 1945.  This task was initially performed by the Racing Board which subsequently became the Irish Horse Racing Authority under legislation introduced in 1994 and Horse Racing Ireland in 2001.  This level of Government support for and understanding of our industry is central to the international position of the sector relative to other jurisdictions.  HRI is a commercial semi-State body the mission of which is to develop and promote Ireland as a world centre of excellence for horse racing and breeding.  The thoroughbred horse industry is a sector in which Ireland has genuine claims to world leadership.  This has been consistently proved in the marketplaces and on the race tracks of the world.  People come from many countries to see how we do things in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In many fields, Ireland has led the way for the rest of the world in thoroughbred racing and breeding.  It produces more thoroughbred foals than Britain and France combined and is the third largest producer in the world.  We produce 45% of the total European Union output of thoroughbreds.<\/p><p>Ireland has legitimate claims to the No. 1 position with regard to quality.  Over 65% of our annual production is exported.  Last year, Irish horses were exported to 36 countries.  I ask the committee to note that the Irish horse racing and breeding industry supports approximately 14,000 full-time jobs that are widely dispersed throughout rural communities.  Some charts that are attached to my presentation show the locations of racecourses and training and breeding establishments across the country.  They illustrate the nationwide distribution of the industry and its investment and employment.  These are not jobs on the east coast or in Dublin; they are in the heart of rural Ireland.<\/p><p> This is the exact type of industry the country needs to protect and develop in the current circumstances.  It is rurally-based and labour-intensive.  It is probably the most environmentally-friendly agricultural activity we have.  It leads to a significant level of international inward investment to Ireland.  Horse racing and breeding is an all-island activity.  It has always been run on a Thirty-two County basis.  Foals born in Tyrone carry the (IRE) suffix after their name, just as foals born in Wexford do.  The two Northern Ireland racecourses at Down Royal and Downpatrick operate under the Turf Club's rules of racing, with 90% of runners coming from the Republic.<\/p><p> This industry contributes over &euro;1 billion in economic output to our economy every year and generates more than 80,000 tourist visits to Ireland annually.  Our 26 racecourses contribute to sporting and social life and are at the heart of local economies.  Festivals at tracks like Fairyhouse, Galway, Punchestown, Killarney and Listowel cumulatively contribute approximately &euro;150 million in economic activity.  Summer racecourses like Ballinrobe, Sligo, Bellewstown and Kilbeggan are key elements of the social fabric of their towns and regions.  Point-to-point racing, which is the starting point for many great national hunt horses, is rooted in local communities.  HRI has specifically increased its contribution to this sector in 2017.<\/p><p> I wish to emphasise the relationship between horse racing and breeding.  The racecourse is the proving ground of the thoroughbred, where its true worth is established.  If Ireland is to have a successful breeding industry, it needs a successful racing industry.  One is the pipeline for the other.  Successful racehorses become successful stallions that attract broodmares, many from outside Ireland.  This, in turn, stimulates economic activity in a wide range of businesses.  Racecourses and farms are more closely linked than many people might imagine.  The majority of breeders in Ireland - 92% - have fewer than five horses.<\/p><p> I would like to give the committee a brief overview of the business and governance structure of Horse Racing Ireland.  The headquarters of the company are at Ballymany on the Curragh, just outside Newbridge in County Kildare.  We have 187 members of staff, 94 of whom are in HRI and 93 of whom are in our subsidiary companies.  These staff are the backbone of the organisation.  I am very proud of our team.  Our board of 14 members acts as the national authority for horse racing by discharging its statutory functions as set out in the Irish Horseracing Industry Act 1994, the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 and the Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016.  Its primary functions under legislation are the administration, development, promotion and governance of the industry.<\/p><p> HRI operates three principal commercial subsidiaries.  HRI Racecourses Limited acts as the holding company for the racecourses at Leopardstown, Navan, Tipperary and Fairyhouse and owns the lands at Cork Racecourse in Mallow.  Irish Thoroughbred Marketing Limited is an international marketing agency.  Its task is to promote Ireland as the best country in the world in which to breed, train, buy and race thoroughbred horses.  Tote Ireland Limited operates on-course and off-course totalisator betting services.<\/p><p> HRI and its subsidiaries are audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  HRI also operates an outsourced internal audit function.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's annual audit reports have never been qualified.  A specific formal audit of corporate governance within HRI by our internal auditors was carried out most recently in 2015 and did not give rise to any significant concerns.  That is not to say there is no room for improvement.  HRI endeavours to address any issues raised by internal auditors in a timely and effective fashion.  HRI's audit and risk committee meets four times a year.  A number of the organisation&rsquo;s functions are carried out through sub-committees of the board, some of which are established under statute and some of which have delegated board authority.<\/p><p> I am aware that the chairman of the board of HRI and some members of the board appeared before this committee in October 2016 to discuss governance processes pertaining to my appointment as chief executive.  I regret the issues that arose at that time.  Arising from this appointment, the board has taken a number of measures to strengthen governance.  It has implemented a succession plan for the chief executive and senior management, introduced management development and training programmes, undertaken corporate governance training for board members and approved a new management structure for the organisation.  I confirm that the importance of proper corporate governance is recognised within HRI at staff and board levels.  HRI is fully committed to compliance with the new code of governance for State bodies, as published last autumn.<\/p><p> Last year was a positive one for the industry as Irish horses enjoyed unprecedented success on the track at home and internationally.  For the first time, the five major races in Britain - the Champion Hurdle, the Gold Cup, the Grand National, the Derby and the Oaks - were all won by Irish-trained horses.  In October, Aidan O&rsquo;Brien completed the unprecedented feat of training the first three finishers in the world's most important flat race, the Prix de l&rsquo;Arc de Triomphe.  Irish-based stallions filled seven of the top ten places in the leading sires table in 2016.  New emerging markets were developed for Irish horses last year.  A copy of HRI's end-of-year press release for 2016, which contains all the key statistics, is attached to our submission.<\/p><p> Despite this strong position, the industry is facing a number of key challenges.  The board and I are determined to address these challenges in a positive fashion with the support of this committee.  We believe a long-term secure and sustainable funding base can be achieved for the industry while saving money for the Exchequer.  Brexit is a significant issue for us because Britain is our biggest market for bloodstock exports.  We also intend to focus on the recruitment and retention of skilled staff within the industry, to broaden the racehorse ownership base and to increase attendance at race meetings in the modern digital landscape.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding these challenges, international successes are very important in underlining the attractiveness of breeding, buying and keeping horses in training in Ireland.  Race meetings are major sporting and social occasions in overseas countries.  Irish winners deliver a very positive image of our country.  I hope we will see further success for Irish horses, trainers, jockeys and breeders at Cheltenham next week.  I again thank the committee for giving me this opportunity to discuss the industry.  We will be happy to address any questions that members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kavanagh.

I acknowledge some members of HRI's board.  Deputy D'Arcy spoke about some of the issues we dealt with at length at a previous meeting.  I think we all agree that the process and corporate governance at that time left a bit to desired.  It is important that lessons are learned by HRI.  I acknowledge the strong role played by the horse racing industry in this country.  We have a very proud history in respect of how it has been built up.  Those in the sector played a role in respect of that.  It is something we need to continue to build upon.  As Mr. Kavanagh said, we have every right to be proud of where we stand as a world leader in the horse racing industry.<\/p> <p>  There are a few points that Mr. Kavanagh might flesh out.  Brexit is an important issue, as it is for many other parts of the agriculture sector.  Mr. Kavanagh outlined how it operates on an all-island basis so Brexit will pose challenges for the horse racing sector.  I would be interested in hearing his perspective on what those challenges are and how we need to meet them.  The export trade is significant.  What issues do we need to be cognisant of to ensure that the horse racing industry is protected and can continue to grow?  <\/p> <p>  The Curragh and Galway are very fine facilities.  Comments have been made about the regional racing network, smaller courses and the investment spread - ensuring there is a good regional spread.  Could Mr. Kavanagh comment on that because there is sometimes criticism about whether the investment is spread?  <\/p> <p>  A number of members will have received correspondence and will been contacted about the foal levy.  What is Mr. Kavanagh's perspective on that?  Could he brief us on the outcome of the recent court case and where HRI currently stands?  Some breeders have argued that an alternative structure should be put in place.  Could Mr. Kavanagh outline HRI's position on that?  Could he comment on the argument put forward by horse breeders that this levy should be based on the paid covering charge as opposed to the listed charge?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#N01700","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Brexit is a huge concern for our industry.  I do not think anyone really knows where it is going or what the outcome will be.  Our position and that of the British industry are quite well aligned.  The two countries have effectively operated as one industry for a number of years.  We operate a single stud book so while foals in Ireland and foals born in Great Britain carry different suffixes after their name, they are in the one stud book.  As we will see next week, Irish and British trainers, jockeys and horses travel over and back on a daily basis.  A hard Brexit will have very serious implications for our sector.  We are concerned that we would end up being collateral damage in a situation that may be slightly out of our control.  I mentioned earlier that the value of our bloodstock exports is &euro;225 million, which is a significant figure by any stretch.  A total of 80% of those exports are to the UK so that is what is at stake for our sector.  As I mentioned in my introduction, the situation is further complicated by the fact that we have always operated on an all-island basis.<\/p><p>Two of the racecourses in Northern Ireland, which are under our jurisdiction and get funding from us as well as being under the Turf Club's rules, could be outside the EU after Brexit.  All trainers in the North are licensed by the Turf Club, 90% of the runners are trained in the Republic and horses move, for racing or breeding purposes, on a daily basis across the Border.  The departments of agriculture in Britain, France and Ireland have a tripartite agreement that deals with the free movement of thoroughbred horses around the three countries and Brexit could affect that by significantly increasing the level of bureaucracy and administration in this area.  One of our leading trainers told us he had a nervous horse who was running at Cheltenham last year.  To calm his nerves, the horse has a goat for a companion who stays in the stable with him.  The trainer told us of the difficulty he had in getting clearance for the goat to travel to Cheltenham with the horse and that the number of forms he had to fill out was frightening.  If that is advanced to horses it would be a horror story for us.<\/p><p> While the two industries are complementary we are also in competition.  In worldwide investment terms, there is a danger Britain will be freed to bring in measures to make the sector more competitive.  If tariffs were introduced for the movement of bloodstock between Ireland and Britain it would create a difficulty, as would tariffs on the movement of labour because many staff in the industry in Britain are Irish.  We had a lot of success in Britain last year with 171 Irish horses running and winning a lot of prize money.  There are media rights deals whereby we sell pictures of Irish racing to the betting industry in Britain and worldwide and the income from those goes to racecourses.  It has been in euro up to now but will switch to sterling in 2019 and there is a risk that the lower rate of sterling will affect that.<\/p><p> These things are all what-ifs and there may also be opportunities, although it is hard to see them.  The British racing authorities see the importance of Ireland to them and 75% of Saturday runners in Britain are Irish-bred or French-bred.  They will have an issue filling their race programme and providing enough runners for people to bet, which is vital because betting is the basis of the British industry model.  The board discussed Brexit yesterday and we will try to commission some work to look at the overall implications.  Our main concern is that our voice gets heard, as part of the agricultural lobby and in Europe.<\/p><p> The development of racecourses is taking place around the country and is one of the most exciting things that is happening at the moment.  There is a big development at the Curragh at the moment but over the past 25 years less than 5% of funding for racecourse capital development has gone to the Curragh and it has always been waiting for a big development.  We introduced a new capital development scheme two years ago in which we were to provide 40% funding if racecourses provided the other 60%.  The response has been fantastic and 24 of the 26 race tracks have taken up the option.  We are working through evaluations and funding proposals for those.  The regional race tracks have shown the most agility in applying for this and whenever I am asked by a person from overseas where to go racing I always suggest Ballinrobe, Killarney, Bellewstown or Kilbeggan because that is where the real flavour of racing is.  I do not see a contest between big tracks and small tracks as they are all part of the racing sector and I have very few sleepless nights about the business models of small, regional racecourses.  They have the ability to get people through the gate and have huge local support.  They have media rights income and most of them race only in summer, relieving them of the cost of keeping staff throughout the winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#N01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I will give a flavour of some of the racecourse applications that have already been approved.  Sligo has plans for a &euro;1.9 million spend.  It only races eight times a year but they have a strong local committee and are planning major refurbishments to the grandstand, as well as a two-storey building for a restaurant and hospitality areas.  Roscommon is spending &euro;964,000 and Ballinrobe is spending just over &euro;500,000.  Listowel in Kerry is spending &euro;1.1 million on a new restaurant facility and has plans to spend a total of &euro;1.5 million.  Kilbeggan will shortly evaluate a &euro;2 million development, which is very exciting and will hopefully add significantly to its hospitality capacity and public facilities.  Killarney plans to spend &euro;850,000 and Tramore &euro;1.2 million so this is not a scheme for a small number of tracks but one for every racecourse.  We try to support them all and have approved the plans of every racecourse so far.  We investigate carefully whether they have the financial resources to provide the 60% funding.  They do not pay a dividend but reinvest their money back into facilities so that they can continue to attract crowds in a challenging economic environment.  Attendances went up last year and that is pleasing and reflects the hard work racecourses do across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jason Morris"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>We have run the scheme for the past two years.  There are many racecourses in Ireland relative to the size of the population and there are a lot of infrastructural needs.  We were able to introduce the scheme as a result of the horse and greyhound racing fund but we regard it as a stimulus for the building sector.  Horse Racing Ireland provides &euro;400,000 for every &euro;1 million spent on development and the racecourses provide the balance.  The tracks are run largely by volunteers on local committees who are passionate about what they do.  Sligo is one of the best examples and has a supporters' club of 400 people who pay significant amounts of money each year.  The Exchequer recoups approximately &euro;243,000 through VAT and employment taxes and, as is the case with prize money, this is a stimulus to the rural economy and the building sector.<\/p> <p>  The worldwide success of the Irish horse racing industry was mentioned but it also goes to the heart of the debate on rural Ireland.  The industry in this country has natural advantages in the form of our soil, land and climate.  We give out about the rain but it works for our business.  The climate, the soil and the people are way ahead of what are available in other countries.  The importance of developing industries to provide employment in rural Ireland has been emphasised and this ticks all the boxes.  We try to spread the capital as widely as possible and racecourses are doing the heavy lifting by putting up 60% of the funding.<\/p><p>When I came into the job at first there were difficulties with some racecourses that had overstretched themselves, in particular, Punchestown and Fairyhouse.  We have now put in a rigorous evaluation process for any capital grant because I do not want a racecourse to run into difficulty on my watch.  Therefore, it goes through the normal rigorous capital evaluation process that would be expected under the code of governance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>The foal levy, Mr. Kavanagh?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#P00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Yes, the foal levy.

People sometimes challenge the amount of money the racing sector gets from the State.  We would argue that there is a way in which the industry can be funded without recourse to a State top-up.  Indeed this committee, in a previous incarnation, recommended that in a report which was issued in January 2016.  It said the sector could be fully funded from betting duty.  People may question the funding of the sector.  Back in 2000, however, breeders came to the Government and said they were happy for a levy to be levied on foals that are born in this country.  However, they wanted the levy to underpin the infrastructure of the breeding industry, as well as underpinning funding of the Irish Equine Centre.  That is the main centre that protects the herd against disease, in addition to doing research and other good things.  They also wanted the levy to fund the breeders' representative association, the ITPA, and the international marketing agency, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing.<\/p> <p>  Legislation was introduced by the late Joe Walsh in 1999 and the foal levy was brought in for the first time in 2001.  It is based on a determined rate for the stallion fee, which is determined by Horse Racing Ireland in consultation with the stallion masters.  It has 99% compliance, so out of 8,500 foals born this year, 8,400 will be fully compliant with the foal levy.  That is paid by the breeders on a tiered basis with the lowest rate being &euro;35 up to the highest rate of over &euro;600.  In terms of the overall cost of producing a foal and getting it to the sales or on to training, the levy is a relatively small element.<\/p> <p>  We have looked at this issue over the years.  The board of Horse Racing Ireland is advised by a foal levy committee.  We made some amendments to the levy in 2011, which increased the number of bands, reduced the level of the lowest bands to &euro;35 and increased the level of the highest bands.  The proportion of the levy that is generated by the various bands is as one would expect.  The lowest bands, which are stallions covering at a rate of &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000, are contributing.  While there is a higher number of foals in those lower bands, the revenue is lower, and likewise at the higher end.  Ms Eade can give the figures.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#P00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>The lower bands represent 6% of revenue but 27% of foals.

From our point of view that would be an administrative nightmare because, like any business, a number of different arrangements are entered into by breeders.  Some breeders own both the stallion and mare, so they are paying no stud fee.  Some get involved in things called foal share whereby they pay half the stud fee and the stallion owner and mare owner agree that they own half the subsequent foal.  There are free return arrangements if a mare has not gone into foal the previous year for some reason, and there is the normal haggling that breeders will have with each other over a nomination fee.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, for a relatively small proportion of the overall cost of producing a foal, to get into each individual transaction would be administratively difficult.  The changes we made in 2011 to the foal levy bands have resulted in the difference between one band and the other being approximately &euro;50, so we are not talking about a major issue.  We feel that a 99% compliance rate is acceptable.  We are required by legislation, including a statutory instrument, to pursue any unpaid levy.  Generally, however, we are able to do that through negotiation, discussion and payment plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#P01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I would like to welcome Mr. Kavanagh and his staff, as well as the chairman of Horse Racing Ireland and some of the board members.  We have had a number of discussions about the appointment of Mr. Kavanagh.  It is recognised that not everything was done in accordance with proper governance.  However, I, for one, would like to move on to discuss where the industry is going in future.  This is a very important industry for the country so we should focus on Mr. Kavanagh's objectives for the next couple of years and how they will be achieved.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kavanagh's submission contains a table with figures I find surprising.  Thankfully, virtually all the first page refers to positive increases.  The only place one sees negativity is in some of the betting figures.  As a person who goes racing, I would not have thought there was an increase in national hunt runners.  I am not doubting the accuracy of those figures but we can see that the number of runners, especially in bumper races, has declined significantly.  According to that table, however, there has been a 4.1% increase in national hunt runners in the calendar year.  While that is welcome, I am surprised by it, although I am not querying HRI's figures.<\/p> <p>  The figures for on-course bookmaker betting and the betting ring all show negative downturns.  I want to ask Mr. Kavanagh a few questions about betting taxes and what he feels is the right direction to take.  Is an increase in the betting levy the route to go?  If it was increased where would HRI spend the extra revenue?  <\/p> <p>  I have concerns about the survival of track bookmakers.  The level of turnover and number of people participating in the trade are dropping dramatically.  I live very near a racecourse and 15 years ago the ring would be full of bookmakers on a race day.  Now, however, it is only one quarter full.  Track bookmakers are an integral part of the industry, yet they are being asked to compete on an unfair playing pitch with the multinationals.  It is unfair to apply the same level of taxation to track bookmakers as to Ladbrokes or Chronicle.  This matter needs to be addressed urgently because if track bookmakers disappear, we will lose much of the culture and atmosphere at our racetracks.  Machines have played a part in taking money out of the ring, but we should incentivise on-course bookmaking.  I would like to hear Mr. Kavanagh's views on an increased betting levy and what proposals he has for track bookmakers.<\/p> <p>  I was glad to hear that Horse Racing Ireland has put more money into the point-to-point sector.  Perhaps Mr. Kavanagh can elaborate on that investment because a lot of small breeders take their horses there for a first outing.  Hopefully small breeders will have success in selling horses on to major owners from the point-to-point field.  I would like Mr. Kavanagh to elaborate on what kind of revenue has been put into the point-to-point sector.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kavanagh said that most country courses only operate in the summer months and do not have the expense of winter racing and resultant staff costs.  However, some small country courses, including the one nearest my front door, are completely involved in winter racing.  Such courses are a very important part of our national hunt industry, although attendances are extremely poor, especially at Thursday meetings.  Only for the SIS there is no way they would survive financially.  Better track facilities are needed on a cold November or January day than on a summer evening.<\/p><p>I would hope that Horse Racing Ireland would look at those tracks that concentrate on winter racing.  I am referring to provincial tracks that provide Thursday racing, which is very important for the horses that will never be heading to Cheltenham but may win a small race on a provincial race track.  I would like to see that those courses are not neglected in the overall plan and that there will be something in HRI's proposals to help them to survive.<\/p><p> Mr. Kavanagh talked about Brexit and the impact that decision is going to have on us and on the industry.  The bloodstock industry has not featured in our discussions on Brexit.  It is something we might want to give more consideration to.  Considering the week that is in it next week, with the British handicapper and his treatment of our horses going over to Cheltenham, that might be something that should come into the Brexit negotiations - fair play is good play.  If there was one that got through the net and was well handicapped it would be nice to know.<\/p><p> In general, those figures in a time when our country is only coming out of recession and money is still scarce, all those positive figures on the table Mr. Kavanagh provided show that something is going in the right direction.  That has to be recognised as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#P01100","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I think the industry is coming out of a very difficult few years.  The figures for the national hunt runners are right, obviously.  It quite interesting.  At the middle of last year, all our national hunt indicators were down - horses in training, entries and runners.  There was such an uplift in the second half of the year that it overcame the problems of the first half and the overall figures for the year were up.  About a year or 18 months ago we saw a lift on the flat.  Perhaps that is because there is a quicker turnaround; a horse runs as a two-year-old on the flat, so as the foal crops started to rise again, more were coming into the system, whereas the national hunt runners do not run until they are four or five and the depressed foal crops of four or five years ago were hitting that.  I am please to say that those national hunt statistics have continued on into the first two months of this year.  That is healthy and we are even getting back to the stage where some people are complaining about being balloted out or taken out of a race.  That is an encouraging trend.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the betting ring, I fully endorse everything the Deputy has said.  The HRI board is very concerned about the long-term future of the betting ring.  It is a big problem.  Turnover from course bookmakers has fallen away significantly.  Technology has caused that.  We are seeing growth in attendance at race meetings mainly at the big festival meetings and the summer race meetings.  As the Deputy says, it is very hard to get people to go to the winter Thursdays.  There is so much racing and sport on TV now.<\/p> <p>  Years ago, people went to the racecourse because it was the place they could get the most money if they wanted to have a bet, a bookmaker would stand a decent bet to them, they got information on a racecourse that they could not get from sitting at home, and they could see the race.  Now the position is almost exactly the reverse.  I can sit on my couch and watch the race.  I am inundated with information online from racing posts and all sorts of other publications.  I can get the best odds on my mobile phone.  It is a huge challenge.<\/p> <p>  The board, led in particular by the chairman, took the decision last year to reduce the charges that on-course bookmakers are charged from 0.5% of turnover to 0.25% of turnover.  We would like to see the charges eliminated altogether.  That money goes to the racecourses  On-course bookmakers pay racecourses five times the admission fee whether they attend or not.  That needs to be looked at.  It is a very high cost for bookmakers in a falling turnover environment.  If we were to lose the on-course bookmakers, Irish racing would lose some of its soul.  The members may have raced in countries like France or the United States, which operate tote monopolies.  It is a lesser experience than racing here or in Britain, I believe.<\/p> <p>  With regard to betting tax, the Irish rate is the lowest of any major racing jurisdiction in the world at 1% of turnover.  It is significantly lower than the rate of tax in the UK.  When the horse and greyhound racing fund was established, the intention was that it would be fully funded by betting tax.  Betting tax was reduced progressively in 2001, from 5% to 2%, and in 2007 from 2% paid by the punter to 1% paid by the bookmaker.  We believe that was wrong.  The intention at the time was to protect small bookmakers' shops in the high street that have to compete with the multiples that were mentioned.  That is really the same as in any business.  Bigger firms are going to compete, whether it is on tax or on marketing spend or whatever.  We believe the rate of betting tax should go up to at least 2% or 2.5%.  That could fully fund the horse and greyhound racing fund at a higher level than is currently the case.  Members should bear in mind that the funding that goes into the horse and greyhound racing fund is still only at the level it was at ten years ago.  In order to develop the industry and look after the key challenges which I outlined in my introduction, we need more money.<\/p> <p>  We need to invest significantly in the Irish Equine Centre.  It has been built by various fundraising efforts and has lived on a wing and a prayer down through the years.  It is vital.  If there is one thing that will affect our industry more than Brexit or anything else, it is an outbreak of disease.  The way the climate has gone, diseases that were previously foreign to Ireland are now becoming more common here.  African horse sickness is a particular example.  There is a need for investment in that whole area.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant need for investment in education, training and employment, staff retention, and in racecourse facilities and in prize money.  We believe that the Government should not be supplementing the betting tax with money out of central Exchequer funds.  The betting tax rate should be high enough to fund horse racing and greyhound racing off its own bat.  I am not just saying that from a horse racing point of view but also from a rural Ireland point of view.  If we look at what is in the media these days about the decline of rural Ireland, this industry can play a significant part in arresting that decline.<\/p> <p>  Alan Dukes did a study some years ago on behalf of the breeders' association, in which he spoke about the clustering of employment in rural areas.  He examined four towns in rural Ireland representative of the regional spread of the sector: Bagenalstown, Enniscorthy, Navan and Fermoy.  They did a survey of the full-time employment equivalents in those areas.  Bagenalstown had 428 full-time equivalent jobs in our sector.  Enniscorthy had 259, Navan had 324 and Fermoy had 162.  When people think of racing they think of the sport of kings, horses racing for prize money, but behind that is a whole network of services.  Taking Bagenalstown as an example, that would include the training yards of Willie Mullins and Jim Bolger, and Red Mills horse feed, which employs 150 people in a state-of-the-art plant in Goresbridge and is exporting all around the world.  It would include all the local trainers, veterinary practices, farriers, suppliers and all those services.  If we are looking at clustering and increasing employment in rural Ireland, this sector is made for it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned his own constituency.  I am not going to get involved in refereeing between Thurles and Kilbeggan as to who should get more funding.  The Deputy makes a fair point about the tracks that race during the winter having particular needs relative to summer racecourses.<\/p><p>I do not think we can get into a different rate of grant for one track over the other.  We apply it across the board.  The rate of our capital grant funding to the likes of the track in Sligo is the same as for the track in Punchestown.<\/p><p> However, for tracks such as those mentioned, we have provided funding for other areas that are not as relevant for the summer tracks, including track drainage and so on.  We have put schemes in place.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the facilities in some of these tracks.  In the first instance we do not want to push racecourses into a situation where they are over-stretched.  Thurles, Clonmel and Tipperary are three important tracks in the Deputy's region.  Two of them operate during the winter.  The facilities could be better.  Clonmel is in the system.  Those responsible have applied for grants and they are being evaluated.<\/p><p> The situation in Thurles is different.  It is the only racecourse in the country that is privately owned.  By that I mean it is not owned by a company, trust or charitable society.  It is a family farm and there are issues around that.  However, without courses such as those in Thurles and Clonmel we would not have winter racing.  Thurles was jokingly described as Ireland's first all-weather racecourse.  It has a history of racing at times when no other turf racecourse in Ireland or Britain was able to be raced.  This is because of the unique soil.  We try to help that area as much as possible.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the point-to-point sector.  We increased our funding for the sector this year by &euro;728,000 up to &euro;2.2 million.  That has been well received.  The point-to-point sector suffered badly during the recession.  Numbers at all levels were affected in terms of horses with hunter certificates, runners, race meetings, attendances and betting.<\/p><p> Having said that, point-to-point racing is a source of a considerable number of the successful national hunt horses we have produced in the country.  Young horses can be tried and can gain experience at these meetings before they go on to race.  It has also developed into an important shop window.  Many British buyers and, increasingly, Irish buyers will buy a horse there.  Many people are buying young horses to run them in a point-to-point race in the hope of winning and getting a good return from one of the bigger trainers who would be prepared to buy a winning horse.  Everyone catches the headlines of the one horse that makes the big money.  However, to some extent, those dealers have probably bought ten or 20 horses.  They need one of them to click to be able to generate a yield.<\/p><p> Point-to-point racing is the soul of Irish national hunt racing.  We have increased our funding in three areas.  We have increased the prize money for point-to-point meetings.  We have increased the grants to the hunts that are staging point-to-point meetings.  We have provided funding to ensure that properly trained medical officers attend every point-to-point meeting.  They are fully trained to deal with serious accidents and injuries.  Those involved in the hunts put in extraordinary work and volunteer time and they need help.  Fortunately, we were able to do provide it this year.<\/p><p> This is reflected at grass roots level.  Some of our best jockeys have come out of that field, including Davy Russell, Ruby Walsh and Norman Williamson.  We have seen some wonderful jockeys down through the years.  Those racing at the moment such as Jamie Codd and Derek O'Connor are as good as most professionals in the UK.  We are keen to support and encourage the sector.<\/p><p> Deputy Cahill referred to the British handicapper - no comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.

We have made our points in respect of the situation that occurred.  I am looking forward to the development of an industry that is providing more than &euro;1 billion annually.  I look forward to the industry continuing to make an important contribution to the rural economy.  It is an important source of supplemental income to many dry stock farmers in the area.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Daly and myself were delighted when we swept two of the major prizes in Britain some months ago, thanks to those wearing the Westmeath colours.  Don Cossack and Rule the World are owned by Michael O'Leary.  The jockeys were wearing our county colours and we were delighted with that.  Annie Power won the champion hurdle and Harzand won the derby.  Minding won the oaks, the other big race.  We won the five big races there.  That was a major success.<\/p> <p>  On-course betting is showing a significant decline.  It could be terminal unless something is done soon.  Unless we do something, we are going to lose something that is important.  I realise Horse Racing Ireland reduced the levy to 0.25%.  This is a welcome move.  Normally, I argue with HRI and I have spent time at this committee arguing with Mr. Kavanagh over the years.  However, I have to be man enough to admit that some of the changes are those we would have argued for.  The HRI board is now implementing them.  We welcome them.  It would be churlish not to welcome them given what is happening.<\/p> <p>  Racing attendances are up.  We know that in the second half of last year attendances began to climb again.  The extra economic activity brought people back.  Some innovation and new ideas to attract the public were brought to bear.  I compliment Senator Daly and his committee.  They are continually re-inventing the wheel in Kilbeggan to bring people in and to try to get sponsorship.  It is not easy for regional tracks or those in the country to get sponsorship.  That is something we should recognise as well.  Sponsorship for some of the big tracks is easy to attract.  It is not so easy when they are situated down the country.<\/p> <p>  One major move by HRI was the move to increase prize money by approximately &euro;4 million.  It is a question of how it is allocated and spread.  That will be crucial.  We have to acknowledge that the level of prize money available to races in this country is up to two or three times what is available in England.  That is important.  There is an increasing focus on lower-handicap races.  This suits small trainers, syndicate owners and those who own two or three horses with a &euro;10,000 minimum value.  This is a major step forward.  A reduction in the cost of entry to those races at the lower end in terms of the handicap has been tackled at last and I welcome the change.<\/p> <p>  We need to make it attractive to own a horse.  We have some high fliers in the country.  They own horses and that is grand.  They are wealthy.  However, others are down at the bottom.  Those in syndicates and partnerships are important to the horse racing industry.  HRI should continue to work in this area and try to make it attractive to own a horse.<\/p> <p>  All is not sweetness and light.  It is important to ensure that everyone in the industry gets a fair crack of the whip.  I am referring to wages for those who work as stock handlers and valets as well as others working in this area.  It is important that they are properly looked after and remunerated.  Often, they are the spokes of the industry wheel.  They work early in the morning and late at night.  There are long periods of travel for them and so on.  It is important that they are paid appropriately.  The last thing we want is any degree of exploitation of that area.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to media rights.  I am delighted that they are out for the next six or seven years.  What is the relevant period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#R01300","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>It runs until 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#R01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>That is great.  Mr. Kavanagh knows the argument I have made in that regard.<\/p><p>Mr. Kavanagh has acknowledged the central role of the smaller racecourses, and I welcome that.  They generally attract good attendances at flagship meetings.  As I said to him, Senator Paul Daly will outline, as chairman of our local course in Kilbeggan, the tremendous amount of work done there.  The course is trying to attract people, including families on group outings, people on business outings and everyone else, while ensuring the ordinary person has a chance to get access to the course for a very reasonable price.  The same goes for the courses in Sligo, Roscommon, Clonmel, Thurles and Ballinrobe.  I visit them all and they represent good value.<\/p><p> I spoke extensively here about point-to-point and the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill.  I do not know what Mr. Kavanagh's view is, but I did not want HRI to be controlled in the rigid fashion originally proposed in the legislation.  I set my face against it and I am glad I did so.  Point-to-point is the seedbed of the national hunt industry, and we welcome the funding increases for it.  These are the real stalwarts of the racing industry.  They are the groups of volunteers without whom some of our greatest horses would never have been seen.  Kilworth and Fowlers Field years ago and the Shillelagh, Castletown Geoghegan, Kilkenny West and Oldcastle are the places where the real racing aficionados are down at the bottom, and it is important that HRI continues to support the point-to-point industry.<\/p><p> As I said, encouragement of syndicates, ownerships and partnerships will be very important, and the reduction of costs in this area is critical.  I wish to raise a point with Mr. Kavanagh in this regard.  Perhaps he will not agree with me but perhaps he might now that money has become plentiful again.  There should be no need for a charge for renewal of colours every year.  If one's colours are the same in 2016 as in 2017, why should HRI get any more money for that?  There is also a charge to confirm one's trainer even if he or she remains the very same.  These are little petty costs on people.  The declaration fee is another that drives me mad.  Mr. Kavanagh might not think it is much, but one can make a declaration and then the horse gets sick or some other bloody thing happens, and one still must pay.  These are irritants, especially during the downtime.  They are all very big cuts.  I ask HRI to try to do something in these areas.  However, I acknowledge and welcome the work that has been done, as I said.<\/p><p> The Curragh is a big development.  Mr. Kavanagh said very little money has gone into it up to now and that it will see a significant capital investment.  It is a beacon for flat racing.<\/p><p> There have been significant developments regarding Champions Weekend, as I said.  I know HRI does much promotion and other work during this fairly important flagship weekend, but the crowd capacity will only be about 6,500, as I understand it.  Maybe I am wrong.  Is that for 2017?  Is that not a failure of forward-thinking?  This is the biggest weekend for money promotion.  Very often that money goes abroad, but that is neither here nor there.  HRI wants Champions Weekend to be a major flagship event.  I know HRI has decided all its plans for 2017 by now, but surely to God it can consider this for 2018.  I am sure the work will not be finished in 2018, seeing as it is such a major development, but surely HRI can remedy and revise this.<\/p><p> I will finish with this.  I thank the Chairman and Deputy Martin Kenny for letting me in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#R01500","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I apologise to Deputy Penrose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#S00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":81,"content":"<p>That is all right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#S00300","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I did not see him earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#S00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.  I know the full levy and I know HRI is constrained, but I am not, and I wish to make that clear to the witnesses.  Mr. Kavanagh pointed out the mechanics and logistics of the method by which the levy is calculated, but it is absolutely mad and absolute nonsense.  A four year old child in a school would not come up with it.  It is such nonsense that the case in the District Court was lost.  I can speak about it.  HRI appealed to the Circuit Court, and I know what happened in the Circuit Court.  The Circuit Court is seeking clarification on the case from the Supreme Court and, as far as I know, HRI is dead set against it going there.  I know the witnesses cannot talk about this but I will raise it because if that is the position, it is an important legal issue.  If the Circuit Court, as I understand it, is in a position to seek a determination regarding a legal issue - I know what the legal issue is - one should only be charged on what one actually pays, not on a putative thing whereby somebody says it was &euro;5,000 and it turns out to be only &euro;1,500.  Perhaps I am incorrectly informed in this regard, although I do not think I am.  This is common sense.<\/p> <p>  This may not have been introduced by the HRI.  It was introduced back in 1999, 2000 or thereabouts.  I have raised this in the D&aacute;il already so I am not coming to this after the fact but before the fact, and it is wrong.  It must be addressed in the interest in fairness.  I know Mr. Kavanagh explained this with tables or graduated it, in fairness, and his colleague at the accountancy end of it says that the lower bands represent 6% of revenue but 27% of foals.  Nevertheless, if something is wrong in principle, it is wrong for the small person, the big person and everyone else.  We must stop fiddly-faddlying about and get on with this and deal with it.<\/p> <p>  Other than that, I wish HRI and the board well going forward.

If people did not have differences, we would never make any progress.  I do not think we ever had that many real differences and I worked very closely with a colleague of Deputy Penrose's, Jack Wall, down through the years, who shared his passion for racing.

It is absolutely vital we protect the on-course bookmaker.  It is not easy to see a solution - I will not hide that - and we are trying as hard as we can to work with the bookmakers on the tracks.<\/p> <p>  I would like to pick Deputy Penrose up on one point.  He said Irish prize money is significantly higher than that in the UK.  That is misleading.  If one takes the straight average prize money per race, the answer is that it is, but if one considers the cost - and the Deputy has criticised some of the costs surrounding declaration of fees and entry fees - that owners are having to pay towards prize money in Ireland compared to the UK, it is significantly higher.  If one nets that prize money out from what the owners contribute and then takes the prize money as an average per horse in training or an average per runner, we are significantly behind the UK and well behind France.  Therefore, while on the face of it the prize money might look attractive, when one scratches beneath the figures, we are behind the international competition.<\/p> <p>  Without trying to sound smart, on the one hand, Deputy Penrose cannot complain that we are charging owners too much but then say the prize money is too high.  Part of the reason for this is that the owners are contributing to prize money.  As part of the new funding structure, for which we are seeking the committee's support for the industry, we would like to be able to reduce all these costs on owners in order to ensure our prize money remains competitive.  We see the money that Horse Racing Ireland, through its horse and greyhound racing fund, puts into prize money as a major stimulus for the rural economy.<\/p><p>Last year we put in enterprise money of &euro;35 million and people will argue that this could go to more worthy causes.  However, that money stimulates in excess of &euro;400 million in investment by racehorse owners in purchasing horses and keeping them in training.  Over 8,500 horses were in training last year and, taking into account the average cost, including veterinary and downstream costs as well as purchase, this is a high return.  The funding should be from betting tax and not from funds needed for general Exchequer purposes, a recommendation the predecessor to this committee made and for which we would seek support from the current committee.  To suggest our prize money is significantly better than in the UK is not to look at the full facts.<\/p><p> The Deputy is right that a media rights contract has been signed until 2023.  That is good but it is a double-edged sword as racecourses can become dependent on media rights.  Some racecourses in the UK have not tied up rights contracts for this year and face losing that income so we cannot be complacent about media rights income.  I support everything Deputy Cahill said about point-to-points.  There was never a desire on the part of Horse Racing Ireland to have provisions in the legislation to control point-to-points in a rigid fashion.  They are part of the industry and we want to support them.  The legislation was possibly a missed opportunity to have the type of dialogue we are having now but the board is committed to supporting point-to-points going forward.<\/p><p> The chairman has put owners front and centre and their costs have been reduced by 30%.  I do not disagree with the point about colours or the authority to act but when our funding was cut we had to find it from somewhere else.  It might be said that we went for the soft targets by implementing charges but we have reduced them by 30%.  We have eliminated eight charges entirely and we will continue our programme to do so.<\/p><p> I was asked about the Curragh and champions weekend.  We are damned if we do and damned if we do not  The Curragh has been starved of development funding and is in dire need of redevelopment.  We have come up with a proposal for a public-private partnership which has generated &euro;32 million in investment.  We are hoping to raise up to &euro;40 million in private investment to reduce the funding the State is required to put in.  The track at the Curragh is central to the flat racing programme and we are too dependent on it.  The Phoenix Park and Leopardstown had very high-quality sprint racecourses but they have both gone.  The M50 took the sprint track from Leopardstown and the Phoenix Park was lost to development.  The Curragh is a unique track that can take up to 30 runners in races over certain distances and to lose that from the flat programme would create challenges.  We decided to continue to race during construction, but with a limited capacity.  The board met the Curragh chairman and chief executive yesterday and I believe the facilities at both meetings will be very good.  It should be remembered that they were not much to write home about before and were decrepit before the works started.  This year could even be one of the most enjoyable Derbies ever because of its uniqueness.<\/p><p> I will not get into the specifics of the case relating to the foal levy but there is 99% compliance with the levy.  The levy is a fraction of the cost of producing a foal.  A stallion might cost &euro;2,500 and production costs could total &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000 in a year but the levy is &euro;35.  None of us likes paying levies or taxes but 99% of breeders comply with it.  Deputy Pentose has been a supporter of our game for a long time and it is much appreciated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#S01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Kavanagh and his colleagues.

The issue for a lot of people is the fact that a lot of taxpayers' money is going into it.  Our responsibility is to ensure that taxpayers' money is well spent.  I will go back to the issue raised by Deputy Michael D'Arcy, namely, the difficulties around the appointment of Mr. Kavanagh last year.  Can Mr. Kavanagh give us an assurance that we will not be back in this situation in five years' time and that he will not be looking for another five-year contract at that point?

It is clear that I have tried to do what is right for Irish racing during my career and I have given a commitment that I will not seek another contract, which is in the minutes of a board meeting.  I have a passion for Irish racing and it is dear to my heart.  However, I fully accept the need for change at senior levels so we have put in place a new management structure, which is designed to bring new blood and new thinking to the senior management team.  We will hopefully fill places in that structure in the near future and it is proposed to allow the new people to be contenders for the position of chief executive, although that does not mean the appointment will be from within the organisation.  The timing for this has been approved by the board.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe that the chairman and I engineered our reappointment.  Everybody acted with the best of intentions, and it must be remembered that there was a hiatus in Government for five months, at a critical time, and there was no Minister between February and May.  The appointment of the chief executive is a matter for the board and that was approved by the board.  It was not the intention to do this without telling anyone.  The chairman told the committee that he wanted to ascertain the position of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before going back to the board.<\/p><p>I certainly have no intention of engineering anything.  As I said to Deputy D'Arcy earlier, I would have been more than happy to compete for the position and if I was successful, fine and if I was not successful, I would accept that.  I have competed previously and I think that would be fair.  That was the basis on which I was appointed in 2009.  The concern about my contract was the fact in 2011, this clause was removed from the contract which I signed noting my concern because it is very difficult for a chief executive to be in dispute with a Department that is providing funding to the industry and I would not want my contract to be a block to that relationship.<\/p><p> I cannot disclose matters relating to the media rights deal.  The Deputy asked for HRI's other sources of income.  They are in our annual report and Ms Eade will be quite happy to go through it with the Deputy.  HRI generates about &euro;5 million from the media rights deal.  The bulk of the deal goes to race courses but it would be inappropriate for me to disclose the value of it because it is a commercially sensitive area.  Mr. Morris and I negotiated it together with the chief executive of the Association of Irish Racecourses, Paddy Walsh.  That was effectively over a three or four-month period and required a lot of knowledge and understanding of the media landscape in the UK and the time to take the right opportunity.  As I said earlier, there is a race course group in the UK that has no media rights deal so there was a day when no pictures from that group were shown in any betting shops in Great Britain, Ireland or any of the betting shops owned by three of the major chains because they had not concluded a deal.  If we were in that position, it would render the race courses very vulnerable so the legislation requires HRI to negotiate the media rights.  That is because one will always maximise the value one gets for those rights by selling them as a package rather than Punchestown thinking it can do one deal and Listowel thinking it can do another one.  That came under the guise of the HRI media rights committee.  The executive work was done by Mr. Morris and I along with the chief executive of the Association of Irish Racecourses.  It was a tender process with interested parties so we invited applications from the various interested parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>So there was a procurement process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#U00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>It was not a public procurement.

If someone wants have a bet, they can watch a race on their phone or IPad.  It is a complex area.  I am not being evasive but I do not believe I can say what deal we did.  It is a commercial deal.

The Indecon report highlights the fact that some race courses are owned by HRI, which acts as the licensing and regulatory authority while the same time being involved in the industry.  It throws up a lot of conflicts.  In addition to that, we see the situation regarding the development of the Curragh.  A number of prestigious individuals are also involved in that deal.  It gets very murky to somebody looking at this from the outside who sees a lot of public money going in there and all these guys up to their necks in it.  HRI is in the middle of it all.

In respect of the Deputy's point about HRI owning some race courses, I understand the issue and if things are murky, it is my job to clarify them at events like today's meeting.  I can meet the Deputy and go through it privately or through the media.  There is no differential between HRI-owned tracks and private tracks in respect of the allocation of capital grants, prize money and marketing grants.  They are all dealt with equally.  Senator Mark Daly will know this.  We have three categories of race track.  HRI owns a track in both category 1, Leopardstown; category 2, Navan; and category 3, Tipperary.  Those tracks are dealt with the same way as other tracks in those categories.  One of our functions under the legislation involves operating race courses we own.  HRI really became involved in race course ownership because we had to.  I mentioned what happened in the Phoenix Park or Baldoyle earlier.  As a property, Leopardstown is worth many multiples of what it is worth as a race course so it is logical for the racing authority to own that race course because if it was owned by private individuals, their duty as shareholders of a company would be to maximise the return from that and it would not be through horse racing.<\/p> <p>  We became involved in owning Fairyhouse when it was effectively bankrupt about ten years ago.  This is the home of the Irish Grand National, one of our most prestigious races.  HRI had to put together a rescue programme.  In my contribution, I mentioned that Punchestown and Fairyhouse overstretched themselves.  We get involved in those race courses in the same way as the FAI and rugby authorities own and operate the Aviva Stadium or the GAA operates Croke Park.  I understand the point made by Deputy Martin Kenny, namely, how this tallies with private ownership.  The only thing I can say is that this is the same as happens in other countries, particularly France.  The racing authority in France owns nine of the principal race tracks.  Perhaps there is a need for greater clarity or transparency around some of the issues we are dealing with or some of the ways in which we are spending our money.  If it is not clear to the Deputy then I must take it that we are not getting the message across and we will have to work on getting that message across more clearly.  There is certainly no favouritism regarding HRI-owned tracks and other tracks.  I can understand how that would be a perception and we probably have work to do to address that perception.  I would welcome the opportunity to meet with the Deputy to discuss the industry in general but also that specific issue because it is a fair point.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the other point-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#U00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Indecon raised it in its report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#U00900","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Throughout my career in racing, I do not know of one race course that has paid a dividend to its shareholders.

Our attendances have held up but they have held up because of our big events, not our run-of-the-mill events.  It is the same as rugby.  More and more sports are being consumed and watched from the couch rather than at the live event.  It is a real challenge to get attendances at those race meetings.

Ten or 15 years ago the track was struggling but it now has a local committee behind it.  They built a fabulous new stand, which is really beautiful.  There is a theme to each of their race meetings during the season so, for example, they have student days and country and western days and the crowds are vibrant.

We look with pride on what organisations such as the IDA and Bord Bia do to promote Ireland overseas.  That is what Irish Thoroughbred Marketing does.  It has a relatively small team with a staff of nine.  They are very hardworking and do a lot of travel around the world.  If we take last week for example, the Minister, Deputy Creed, was on an agri-food trade mission to the Gulf.  We were able to take part in that and he very kindly hosted and spoke at a reception for Irish Thoroughbred Marketing in Dubai with Dubai trainers and Dubai-based owners about the advantages of buying horses in Ireland.  Last year, 25% of the horses that won races in Meydan, which is the main racecourse in Dubai, were Irish bred.  They were born here.  Last year, seven of the first ten finishers at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe were born in Ireland.  The Melbourne Cup in Australia has become a big market for stayers, which are horses that run over longer distances.  Three or four years ago, eight of the first ten in the Melbourne Cup, the biggest sporting event in Australia, were Irish.  They had &quot;Ire&quot; after the horse's name.  Irish Thoroughbred Marketing is out there trying to encourage and promote these successes to get buyers to buy horses at the horse sales in Ireland, to have horses in training in Ireland or to base their breeding operation in Ireland.  Compared to some of its international counterparts, it is run on a shoestring.  I am not belittling &euro;1.8 million because it is a decent amount of money but if we were able to spend more, it could do a lot more.<br\/><br\/>To return to the earlier point about Brexit, if it becomes a problem we will be challenged very strongly to look for new international markets.  The difficulty we have is that national hunt racing, which is the side that produces many of our foals, it is an activity that is restricted to Ireland, Britain and France.  The flat scene is where the global market and global buyers are.  We will have to travel the world a bit further.  There is great opportunity there.  American buyers are now looking to Europe because pedigrees have gone stale in America.  There are difficulties in America with the use of medication on horses.  There are people questioning the toughness of the American breed and they are coming to buy horses in Europe now and particularly in Ireland in order to bring them into their pedigrees to strengthen them.  To do that, we need to get feet on the ground around the world, as Ms Eade said. <br\/><br\/><b>Deputy Martin Kenny:<\/b>That is helpful.

I should not only refer to our track.  It is hard for me; it was a slip of the tongue as much as anything else.<\/p> <p>  The provincial tracks that are running in off-season with limited meetings do not have the same disposable income to put up their 60% in order to draw down the 40% of the taxpayers' money or the share of the media rights that is being held for grants.  There is a well-known saying that the weaker the patient, the greater the care required.  The value and importance of the provincial tracks with regard to employment and tourism in rural Ireland has been pointed out by many speakers this evening.  Deputy Cahill referred to racing during the winter when nobody else can race because of ground conditions.  In our instance we organise racing during the summer and provide national hunt racing for the weaker type of horse that will not be going to the Cheltenhams of this world.  We provide that service to the paying public in the area who like being able to attend the local rural country race meeting with a family atmosphere like that being created in these tracks.  Providing the facilities will cost more in some ways than the bigger tracks who will have the cashflow because they have festivals.  Mr. Kavanagh said he does not like doing that.  I am being very parochial.  My question is would Mr. Kavanagh consider looking at that differently in future?  He also said he does not have any sleepless nights over the category 3 racetracks.

I do not see it in a big track-small track, us and them, context.  I see them all as part of the tapestry of Irish racing.  If we are trying to sell or promote Irish racing, we are promoting a whole variety of things, whether it is the racecourse experience, the breeding industry or tourism.  Tiered grants is something the board will look at.  We have a strong desire to get the funding structure we spoke about earlier in place.  The current capital grant scheme will run out in 2019.  Most of that money has already been earmarked for racecourses and we are working with Kilbeggan and other racecourses to finalise current plans.  We hope to put in place a further grant scheme thereafter.  I have no compunction about looking at the idea of tiered grants but it is not easy.

That letter was drafted after my appointment.  It was written in September.  I draft letters for the chairman as a matter of course, both the current chairman and previous chairmen.  That is a normal way that chairman-chief executive relationships work.  The letter the Deputy is referring to was a letter from my chairman to reflect a board decision.  I do not have the detail to hand but in terms of the sequencing of things, my appointment was approved by the board at a July board meeting, which I think was 21 July.  I am well aware, as was the chairman, that it was a function of the board to appoint the chief executive.  I was not in the room at the time but there was a long debate at that board meeting about the appointment and ultimately the appointment was approved.  I am speaking from memory because I do not have the record in front of me.  There were at least two board meetings in September at which the board reconfirmed the appointment.  At the second of those board meetings, there was an instruction to issue a statement to the media and write to the Minister to outline the decisions that were taken.  That is the letter the Deputy is referring to.  It was to reflect a decision that had already been taken by the board.  The chairman was not bypassing the role of the board.<\/p><p>That was certainly not anyone's intention.  That letter largely reflected what was in a press statement agreed unanimously by the board at its meeting.  I cannot remember the specific date.  I believe it was around 11 September or 12 September.  A press statement was issued thereafter that was actually drafted by the board itself.  It finalised the wording.  The letter was to update the Minister, Deputy Creed, on the situation.  I believe it was before he was coming before this committee.  It was drafted by me and signed off by the chairman and deputy chairman on behalf of the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#W01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Kavanagh not consider that to be lobbying?

It is a major project.  The Deputy asked what kept me awake at night.  It is not Kilbeggan racecourse.  The development at the Curragh represents a great opportunity.  I would not describe the shareholders as private developers.  They are people who have been investing in our business for over 30 years.  Most of them are from overseas and have put a lot of people in high-quality jobs via their operations in Ireland.  They have got behind the current project.<\/p> <p>  The reason there is a tripartite arrangement is there was a previous attempt to develop the Curragh racecourse before the Celtic tiger era.  Thankfully, it failed, if that does not sound stupid, because it would have been a white elephant.  It was typical of what was planned at the time.  While certain moneys were lost, including by the owners of the Curragh racecourse at the time, no State money was lost in the project.  That was down to the ethos we pursued in capital development programmes.<\/p> <p>  I am sure the Deputy is familiar with the Curragh racecourse.  I do not know if she was in the room for my earlier remarks, but in the past 20 years less than 5% of the capital investment in racecourses has gone into our primary racecourse.  It is not a good showpiece for the industry.  When I attend a match in the Aviva Stadium or Croke Park, I am proud of these venues.  The Curragh is the track that receives the most overseas visitors and we want to show off to them.  We set up a company with a three-way split.  The Turf Club which owned the site did not have the funds to develop it and agreed to put the asset into a new company.  On behalf of the State, we agreed to provide funding for the redevelopment of the site.  We sought and are still seeking private investment in the company.  We generated &euro;32 million in private investment quite quickly, money the State will not have to put in. <\/p> <p>  I do not think it is correct to refer to private developers.  I am very conscious of the points the Deputy is making about the mixture involved, of which we need to be mindful.  I stand over the organisation's track record in terms of the previous development and what happened at Punchestown and Fairyhouse which we were able to rescue from the brink of financial difficulties.  We need to apply the same thinking to the Curragh racecourse.  We took serious cognisance of this and were conditioned by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to participate in the company.  In order to participate in it, as a State body, we required ministerial approval from the two Departments, which we sought and received, subject to a number of conditions, with which we have complied.   We evaluated our investment in the company through an independent evaluation process which was chaired by and involved three external parties which comprised someone from Deloitte, the chairman of our audit committee and a retired staff member.  They put the process through the ringer, brought it to the board and recommended that the investment proceed, subject to the Curragh company satisfying nine conditions, all of which have been satisfied.  It is a very complex project which has been chaired by Mr. Padraig McManus who is involved on a voluntary basis.  While it is very exciting, it needs to be watched carefully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#Z00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>It does and I am not referring solely to the big guns.

I do not accept that HRI cannot talk about it because of a court case because nobody is asking its representatives to talk about it.  I want to know how much money it spent in defending the indefensible.  We have to be clear on the amont.  Mr. Kavanagh said only a sum of &euro;50 was involved and that it was not really an issue.  What led to the court case was a sum of &euro;150 for an owner awarded by the small claims court.  We will call it a victory, one which was celebrated across the industry.  People were delighted because of the discrepancy highlighted by other Deputies.  HRI spent a significant amount of taxpayers' money in launching an appeal against that decision and then turned up in court with the biggest possible legal guns to block the case from being taken to the Supreme Court.  I read the coverage in local newspapers.  The case could have been taken with the approval of HRI and so on.  It did not have to state anything but it spent a lot of money in trying to block the case.  How much was spent in doing so?  I do not accept the point that the foal levy system would be an administrative nightmare if the case was abandoned.  It would not be.  It is like everything else that people buy in shops.  They do not pay VAT on the advertised price.  If a person buys a can of Coke in a shop, he or she receives a receipt which shows the price actually paid which includes VAT.

That was a very significant and in many ways a very appropriate increase.  From my knowledge of the industry, it is the key issue that comes up on a daily basis in my part of the world.  This is a significant issue on the point to point circuit in south Cork, Waterford and Tipperary.  It is probably one of the most important investments in that sector of the industry.

Is this a once off increase?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#AA02400","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>No.  I think it goes back to the point I made earlier about funding.  We are looking for the support of members of this committee on the funding issue.  That is just one area.  Deputy Clare Daly has spoken about staff and we spoke of other areas that need further investment.  I believe that further investment will generate a significant return for the country if we can move away from the perception of a sport to an environmentally friendly natural industry.  Our intention is to increase the funding for point to point meetings, if possible.  In order to do that we need an overall funding solution for the industry and we believe we have that solution.  I am always wary of somebody from Cork who is claiming that he or she does not know that much about something, but Senator Lombard is from the heartland of point to point.  It was good to be able to do something for the point to point sector this year.  A good case was made for funding and fortunately we were able to do that.  I think that will produce a good yield.  It will benefit local communities.  If somebody has a horse running in a point to point, people in the village or the town will go to see the horse.  Those horses then graduate on to the racetrack.  It is a huge nursery for Horse Racing Ireland at all levels.  If we can address the funding issue, it will be our intention to continue to fund and increase funding for point to point meetings.

As I said earlier the horse and greyhound racing fund was originally set up to be fully funded from betting tax but the yield from betting tax has dropped.  If one sets aside the needs of horse racing and greyhound racing, one must bear in mind that in 2001 in this country betting amounted to approximately &euro;1.3 billion and the Exchequer got &euro;68 million.  Betting in this country last year amounted to approximately &euro;5.5 billion and the Exchequer got &euro;50 million from it.  It only got that &euro;50 million because the Government introduced legislation to capture tax from offshore betting in 2015, which is now yielding &euro;20 million.  It seems illogical that a sector that was generating tax of &euro;1.1 billion 17 years ago has now increased fivefold and it is generating a lower yield.<\/p> <p>  In the very good report it published in January 2016, the committee said that it recognised that Ireland has the raw materials in terms of land, climate and knowledge to maintain a world class equine industry and to grow it in terms of employment.  The committee believes there should be a national plan for the development of the industry and that the necessary extra funding required to implement it should be raised through increased revenue from the betting levy.  The report went on in the specific recommendations to refer to increased funding being made available for the development of the thoroughbred sector by increasing the revenue derived from the betting duty.  As I understand it, that issue will be addressed.  The Government said the first thing it would do in relation to betting was look at the tax that was being avoided by offshore companies and that was addressed in 2015.  It said once the system was up and running it would look at the rate of betting tax.  Again, we can provide the committee with any assistance it requires in terms of our knowledge and experience of other countries.  I feel there is cross-party support on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Just on that point, is the betting tax to which Mr. Kavanagh referred on all bets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#BB00400","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Yes, all bets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#BB00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>It does not matter whether the bet relates to GAA or soccer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#BB00600","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017030700002#BB00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>It is an interesting scenario that Mr. Kavanagh proposes that a bet on one's local GAA match would go to fund the local horse racing industry.

It is not exceptional.  Hong Kong is a good example.  It has probably the most sophisticated betting sector in the world.  People are only allowed to bet on horse racing and soccer and tax revenue goes back to fund the horse racing sector.  It is a case of how one looks at it.  The sector gets no real supports other than the horse and greyhound racing fund compared to other agricultural sectors.  The total fund that goes into horse and greyhound racing fund is 2.7% of the annual budget of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is 5% of the voted expenditure.  Of the money that comes from the EU, and the money that comes through the Department or through the Vote, it is a relatively small percentage.  The food sector, fisheries and forestry get direct support.  There is a logical argument that there should be direct support for this sector, in particular in terms of the arguments about rural areas.  If we are serious about supporting rural Ireland, the Vote should support this sector because it is a bastion of the rural economy and it presents a good image for Ireland internationally.<\/p> <p>  The system worldwide is that betting funds racing.  The horse and greyhound racing fund was set up and the betting tax was ring-fenced for horse racing and greyhound racing.  The bulk of betting still takes place on horse racing and greyhound racing, in particular in betting shops.  The betting that is not on horse racing and greyhound racing is largely on events that are outside Ireland anyway.  Senator Lombard is correct that it needs to be looked at.  There was a three-stage process - first, get the offshore issue addressed; second, look at the rate; and, third, look at the distribution of the rate.

I will keep it succinct because the committee has the written presentation.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of key objectives that we are trying to reach with this charter for students and parents.  One is to fill what we feel is a gap in the Education Act 1998 by setting out in this legislation the principles that schools must apply in their engagement with students and parents.  If one looks at the 1998 Act, one will see some measures that relate to parents or to students but one does not see any cohesive set of principles that set out the way parents or students should be treated by a school.  That is the first objective and that will be done in the proposed legislation by replacing the existing section 28, which speaks about grievances narrowly, with much broader legislation.  The key thing we are trying to achieve here is a change of culture.  Having a statutory charter would bring about changes in how schools interact with parents.  The key thing is that if things are done differently at the beginning, or on a day-to-day basis, difficult grievances do not arise or are minimised, simply because the issues are resolved in advance.  The charter is about coming at this in a different way than before and trying to front-load measures that will bring about a change of culture.<\/p> <p>  The second key piece is that we ultimately arrive at a standardised parent and student charter in all schools.  The legislation itself is enabling.  It sets things out.  The key piece of work will begin after enactment, if the Oireachtas decides to enact it.  That will be when the Department will have to sit down with the education partners to work out the details and to put flesh on the charter.  The Minister is given the power to make them the statutory guidelines.  We see that work being done in the manner in which we work with our education partners on many things, that is, where we get together in a room and around a table and have working groups.  That is what we mean by consultation when the Bill talks about the Minister producing the guidelines based on consultation that will have taken place.  The principles I spoke of at the beginning are sort of the basic skeleton, the Bible if you like, that has to be followed in the making of the guidelines.  The real piece of work will be there.<\/p> <p>  The third key piece we are doing here is the linkage with the Ombudsman for Children.  We see that as quite important.  It brings in a set of measures where the Ombudsman is not stopped from proceeding with an investigation or examination of a matter simply because an appeal within the school has not concluded, which is the current legal position.  One of the heads of the Bill is to remove that.  The other is to give the Ombudsman the capacity to examine matters within the charter.  The charter itself will be extensive in terms of the things it will cover.  They are in the papers we presented.  Critically, if the Ombudsman then makes recommendations to a school, either in a formal space or after a formal investigation, this head makes legal provision for the Ombudsman to write to the Minister and say that he or she is unhappy with a situation and that the school does not seem to be taking his recommendations on board.  The Minister can then raise that with the school.  It is provided for in the law that the school can respond but that ultimately the Minister can give a direction.  We have a mechanism here that can bring about change in the school in what is hoped will be the small number of cases that will ultimately arise and arrive with the Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Hanevy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Like Mr. Hanevy, I will shorten what I have to say in light of the limited time available.

As was stated earlier, the Ombudsman for Children's office, OCO,  is an independent human rights institution established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to promote and monitor the rights of children in Ireland.  We examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administrative actions of public bodies.  We are independent and impartial, and act neither as an advocate for the child nor as an adversary of the public body.  We respect and promote local complaints procedures, and we aim to achieve systemic change that addresses the root causes of complaints.<\/p> <p>  I am statutorily obliged to consider the best interests of the child and to give due to consideration to the wishes of the child, in accordance with age and understanding.  I also have a statutory remit to promote and monitor the rights and welfare of children.  This involves a number of actions, one of which is to advise on legislation as I am doing today.  It is the opinion of my office that the general scheme of the Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill sets out a sound legislative framework to improve engagement between schools, students and parents.  It will also increase consistency across schools' complaints handling practices.  The implementation of a charter across all schools will see a cultural shift in how they operate.  It will see a move away from reacting to and dealing with grievances after they occur.  Instead, schools will have to engage proactively with students and parents to establish their views and positively invite feedback, and will have to be open to concerns and negative comments.  The early identification of concerns will allow problems to be considered and dealt with by the school, and will minimise or avoid reliance on formal compliant procedures.  The guidelines on the charter will also include procedures to deal with any grievances that occur once the charter is in place.<\/p> <p>  This very much complies with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, and will be a significant move towards fulfilling commitments made by all the Departments under the national policy framework for children and young people, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  In February 2016, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that Ireland should ensure the Education Act 1998 is amended to guarantee the right of the child to be heard in individual cases.  By bringing forward this Bill, the Minister is beginning the implementation of that recommendation.  The Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill provides an opportunity for the general principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to be incorporated in legislation, both through specific provisions and at a more general level.  The full implementation of Article 12 in this educational context is of particular importance because it enshrines children&rsquo;s right to freely express their views in all matters involving or affecting them. <\/p> <p>  The Bill also seeks to strengthen the role of my office when dealing with complaints about schools.  In 2015, some 45% of the complaints we received were about education and of those, three quarters related to individual schools.  In our experience, local resolution involving children, parents and boards of management leads to fast and effective conclusions.  However, there are cases where more difficult complaints arise and it is important that there is a robust system in place.  This Bill would require boards of management to consider any suggestions, guidance or recommendations issued by my office and would provide the Minister for Education and Skills with a power of direction in respect of the encouragements or recommendations of my office.  It should be noted that this is likely to be used sparingly. <\/p> <p>  While this legislation will strengthen the work my office can do with schools, the statutory role and independence of the OCO will in no way be compromised.  I wish to emphasise the importance of consulting with children and young people at policy level when developing the legislation that will provide for the establishment of the charter.  If we move forward with a change-around in terminology to call it a student and parent charter, this would put the emphasis on children.  Children should also have their views taken into account when developing individual school charters. <\/p> <p>  In respect of the Education (Amendment) Bill 2015, I last appeared before this committee on 21 October 2015, the same day that Deputy Jim Daly first presented his Private Members' Bill to the D&aacute;il.  As outlined in our submission today, I believe that the Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill addresses the issue of principals and boards who do not respond to the encouragements and recommendations of my office.  Establishing an ombudsman for education with legally binding powers would add another legal layer without addressing the systemic problem.  It would result in confusion and new legal costs for schools and families, many of whom may not be able to afford such costs.  This would change the whole dynamic of complaint handling and would undoubtedly lead to longer delays.  I feel strongly that it would demotivate parents and carers from bringing complaints.  <\/p> <p>  It is also important to note that from a practical point of view, in respect of many of the complaints received by my office, while the main issue may be education related, there may be aspects involving disability, health, children in care, housing or other issues.  At present my office has the ability to address such complaints in their entirety.  This allows us to work across various Departments and organisations to achieve local resolution, or to effectively investigate a complaint. <\/p> <p>  Since I last appeared before this committee, Part V of the Education Act has been implemented.  This allows for professional conduct issues to be properly addressed via the Teaching Council.  This was a change called for by the OCO since we were set up.  I expect that this will have a significant impact on complaints handling in schools and will afford parents a much more direct route to complain about professional misconduct.  <\/p> <p>  Since the establishment of the OCO, we have investigated many education complaints and our recommendations have contributed to positive systemic change in a number of areas.  In individual schools, too, we have successfully worked with principals and boards during preliminary inquiries.  We work to improve communications with parents and children, to highlight and alleviate gaps in policies and to enhance engagement with students.  We look forward to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill which will introduce designation, called for by this office after we published an investigation into a case where one student was refused access to 28 schools.  In 2016, we published a report on complaints received regarding the State Examination Commission&rsquo;s reasonable accommodations for certificate examinations, RACE, scheme, which provides exam supports for children with specific learning needs.  This scheme has since been reviewed.  Our Education In Focus report, published in 2016, outlines other work carried out by the office in the area of education.  I very much believe that the parent and student charter would place Ireland in a strong position internationally in respect of our obligations under the UNCRC and it would attest strongly to the Government&rsquo;s promise to deliver on the commitments made under Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  It is the opinion of my office that the parent and student charter would best serve children and young people by developing a culture of participation and engagement.  It also provides a robust complaints procedure in those cases where a local resolution cannot be achieved.  I look forward to working with the committee in advancing this legislation in the best interests of children.  I thank the members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon for his submissions on the two Bills in addition to his own statement.

Our offices work very closely together and our views on these matters are shared.  I would obviously defer to Dr. Muldoon on the issues of the charter in so far as it affects the rights of children.  I am fully supportive of his remarks.<\/p> <p>  I want particularly to address proposals for the creation of a new ombudsman for education.  I have concerns about this, which I think are similar to those expressed by Dr. Muldoon.  The first is that most of these proposals relate to schools.  Much of the work of my office is in the field of education.  Much of that is in further and higher education, including issues about access to education for students with disabilities; grants for further and higher education; and the administration of universities and institutions of further and higher education.  This is a significant piece of work and, if we were to have something called an education ombudsman, it would create confusion in the mind of the public.  People would automatically assume that matters of further and higher education - grants and so on - would rest with that office.<\/p><p>That is a general concern about confusion.<\/p><p> There is another concern about creating a proliferation of ombudsmen's offices.  People need to know where to go.  Currently, they do.  If more offices are created, though, confusion can be created.  Across the water in the UK, there was a growth in the number of ombudsmen.  This caused a great deal of confusion and is now leading to legislation to consolidate offices.  We do not want to repeat the mistakes of others.  That is not to say that I disagree with the intentions, given that they are correct.  Some of Dr. Muldoon's remarks in support of that are important to bear in mind.<\/p><p> Speaking as the Ombudsman for public services, those services are democratically accountable to Members of the Oireachtas in respect of Departments and Government agencies or to local authorities.  That means that ombudsmen's recommendations, which do not have the force of law, are almost always observed.  In the 31-year history of my office, only one recommendation has not been implemented.  In the case of private sector ombudsmen, however, mechanisms are needed to ensure that their recommendations are delivered upon, given that the same democratic accountability does not exist.  The proposals giving the Minister the capacity to make directions would achieve that.<\/p><p> I draw the committee's attention to a final point.  Were a new office to be established, we would have all of the costs and delays associated with its establishment.  We would have to recruit someone, find premises and provide the office with ICT and it would have to develop processes and procedures.  All of that takes time and money.  Were the powers of existing offices to be extended, however, it would simply be a matter of recruiting new staff who could undertake that work within processes, procedures and a management structure that already exist and offices that have a record of delivering.<\/p><p> The Oireachtas needs to achieve what is proposed, but it can be done within the context of the existing framework.  The legislation that is on the table to extend those powers and jurisdictions would have the necessary effect without creating confusion and incurring costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tyndall.

The issues arising from both Bills are our bread and butter.  Every day we receive complaints from parents about schools after they have gone through local complaints processes, contacted the Department of Education and Skills and the Ombudsman for Children's office, which redirects them to local resolutions, and the boards of management will not budge on decisions.  If parents are at the start of that process, we usually talk them through it so as to ensure that they do not go down the wrong avenue before contacting the Ombudsman for Children's office.  After they have done that and still do not have a resolution, though, they are often in a dire psychological state.  I have personal experience of that, believe it or not.  I have been there with a board of management.  I have also sat on a board of management, so I am well aware of how boards operate and the challenges of having that responsibility.<\/p> <p>  These complaints are the bread and butter of the Ombudsman for Children's office, with 45% of them relating to education.  We have concerns about the capacity of the office to conduct investigations in a timely fashion.  Its own reports indicate that although there may be a resolution in a case, the child has either aged out of the school or the parent has voluntarily, albeit under pressure, removed the child to a new school placement.  That is not necessarily in the best interests of the child or parent in terms of the former's educational pathway.  Were the Ombudsman for Children's remit to be extended, we would like it to have greater capacity so that the investigation process could be undertaken in a timely fashion.  In the interim, we advocate for a formal, free advocacy or mediation service, be that under the auspices of the Ombudsman's office or an external service, whereby schools and parents can find local resolutions.  Some schools have funded mediation, particularly where there have been heated disputes, but doing so is up to each school.  The parent is often not in a position to afford a mediator and the school may be reluctant to allow in an external person.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Daly introduced the Education (Amendment) Bill 2015.  I have been giving out about the problem with boards of management for a considerable length of time, so I commend the Deputy on introducing the Bill and recognise that, as an ex-principal, it was difficult for him to do.  We find that many boards side with their principals' opinions and defer to their day-to-day managers regardless of whether they have different opinions on a case.  As long as the theme and intentions of the Education (Amendment) Bill are fulfilled within the parent and student charter, we would welcome whichever Bill proceeds if there is a solution that is external to the boards of management - another pathway for a parent to take where the interests of the child are paramount - and the Minister has the power to make the board's decisions accountable.<\/p> <p>  In the decision-making process, the balance of power in schools has shifted towards the boards of management.  This can have an impact.  For example, if the relationship between the parent and the principal breaks down, the latter has the power to sway board decisions.  The principal can also withhold information from the board - I have seen this at first hand - and, therefore, a board's decision is often not based on the reality of the situation or the complaint.  Parents try to subvert this process by contacting the parents' representatives on boards so as to ensure that the latter have whatever correspondence or complaints have been delivered to the board's chair.  As such, I would welcome better accountability in the decision-making processes of boards and oversight of how they reached a decision.<\/p> <p>  In general, we recommend the proposals in the parent and student charter, which would provide for parents and students to be treated more equally and with greater esteem.  The self-esteem of a parent who is fighting for a child's rights can be battered by the power that boards of management hold within the system, especially when there is no \"out\" if the decision is contrary to what the parent would like to see.<\/p> <p>  We have submitted observations on the heads of the Bill.  Some aspects have left us questioning the decision-making processes between the Ombudsman for Children and the Minister for Education and Skills.  For example, if the Ombudsman advises schools on a pathway to a resolution but they disregard it, at what point does the Ombudsman approach the Minister, would that be timely and what would be the timeline for the Minister to respond to the difficulties at the schools?<\/p> <p>  The Bill appears to give boards the right to reply to the Minister's office.  We would ask that the parents concerned and student body also be given that right.  Otherwise, an unbalanced power will be given to the boards.<\/p> <p>  Head No. 4 is unclear as to who would inform the Minister of a school charter's non-compliance with the Bill's proposed guidelines.  Would that be picked up through a complaint or the inspectorate?<\/p> <p>  One of the Bills seeks to establish a separate office of an ombudsman for education that would have a restrictive remit, given that education spans a broad area beyond just schools.  On the other hand, there is a proposal to extend the powers of the Ombudsman for Children.  As long as the outcomes are positive for parents and their children, we do not mind which pathway is chosen.  I assume that the decision will come down to the financial considerations.<\/p><p>It is proposed that student councils would give more regard to the interests of the students within a school than the school itself.  We want that same powerful principle to apply to any decision-making by boards of management.  Protectionism and risk aversion have strangled decision making in boards of management.  The outcomes are not always in the best interest of the child but influenced by insurance and indemnities, fear and ignorance, misinformation and lack of internal transparency, and fear of legal action by parties concerned. It may be timely for the Department of Education and Skills, managerial bodies and education stakeholders to review the composition, functions and processes of boards of management in line with the processes under pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dempsey.

It does not have any remit at second level.  We looked at both amendments, beginning with the Education (Amendment) Bill.  The IPPN considers the establishment of an ombudsman for education unnecessary and sees no justification for an additional oversight layer.  A number of people have addressed that it would be another layer on top of layers already within the education system.  <\/p> <p>  We currently work very well with Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Muldoon, has articulated his own position eloquently today, and we concur with everything he has brought to the table here.  That is based on our experience as principals and as an organisation representing principals and deputies.  If there were issues regarding that relationship we would not be currently working in tandem with him on other groups such as the well-being for teachers and learners group which we have established in the recent past.  The Ombudsman for Children and his office works collaboratively and effectively with schools and professional organisations such as ourselves in representing the voice of children.  It encourages schools to have robust and effective policies and practices in place to promote the welfare and the rights of children.<\/p> <p>  The provisions of the Education (Parent &amp;amp; Student Charter) Bill as outlined will strengthen the current role of the Ombudsman for Children.  In doing so it will eliminate the necessity to establish an ombudsman for education, for all the reasons that have been put forward by other speakers today.  The number of pieces of legislation in recent years has created a considerable stranglehold on an already oversubscribed sector.  The current system can include the Ombudsman for Children's office in the new charter.  We believe it is unnecessary to consider an ombudsman for education.<\/p> <p>  The IPPN welcomes and supports the provision of a parent and student charter, particularly when the focus is on fostering culture change within school communities to prevent grievances from arising.  Schools are all about prevention.  If we address things at an early stage in any grievance, that is the best possible way to deal with complaints.  As outlined in the parent and student charter, we believe that this focus on culture change would enhance that.  Schools currently work collaboratively at primary level with parents and pupils to promote the welfare and rights of children.  We welcome the setting out in law of principles of engagement with students and parents.  It is well-established that a significant number of primary schools have a well-functioning parents' association.  Those that do not are currently looking creatively at establishing parents' associations.  Working collaboratively with parents underpins everything that our organisation adheres to.  Primary schools have engaged in recent years with establishing student councils.  I am an advocate for that.  It has worked very well in my school.  We have seen very good examples of student councils working extremely well at primary level.<\/p> <p>  Current procedures used to address parental complaints in schools have been agreed by management bodies and unions.  I am aware they have not been agreed to by the National Parents Council.  However, these procedures are not underpinned by legislation.  They have in the past and are currently widely interpreted, often giving rise to confusion and conflict.  Schools will require significant assistance in drafting individual parent and student charters as there could be a variety of interpretations of the elements outlined in the legislation, which would be counter-productive.  We would be happy to see the complementary role of the parent and student charter and the school self evaluation mode mentioned in the parent and student charter outline.  It is viewed by the IPPN as a very positive move.<\/p> <p>  I am heartened to hear from the Department that the skeleton of this charter is currently there, and that the details of this charter will be worked out with the partners in education.  That has worked very well with the Department and ourselves heretofore.  We look forward to examining the detail and influencing how it will look when finished.<\/p> <p>  We are all about resolution. Schools are all about resolution, not about conflict.  If we look to this parent and student charter as it is evolving, we do not see that the establishment of an ombudsman for education is warranted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Doyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.<\/p> <p>  In 2012, the National Parents Council, NPC, made a submission to the then Minister for Education, requesting a strengthening of the role of parents in the Education Act.  The research overwhelmingly supports the benefits of parents' involvement in their children's education.  Before making its submission to the Minister in 2012, the NPC examined the status of parents and parental involvement in the Irish primary education system.  A significant amount of policy supporting parental involvement ranging from the literacy and numeracy for learning and life strategy, to school inspection procedures and many other policy areas was evident from this examination.  However, despite the range of policies and procedures that have been developed that reinforce parental involvement in schools, parents consistently report to the NPC that they do not feel supported to be involved in the key partnership role they have in their  children's education.  <\/p> <p>  The NPC examined the legislation regarding parental involvement and further examined directives to schools in the form of circulars issued.  Irish legislation, namely the Education Act, gives express rights to parents and responsibilities to school boards of management in supporting parents.  However, compared to other jurisdictions, Irish legislation is quite limiting in its reach, in particular in regard to school planning regarding parental involvement.  The legislation does not provide in depth direction to schools.  However, Circular 24\/91, \"Parents as partners in education\", issued by the Department of Education and Skills, did give clear guidance to schools in regard to the involvement of parents in their children's education.<\/p><p>The circular contained a number of key instructions for schools regarding their role in working with parents as partners in schools.  The NPC wished to learn to what extent parents had experienced the benefits of the implementation of the circular in their school and therefore initiated a survey to its membership to assess the impact for parents of Circular 24\/91.  Broadly, this is the background to how we came at the parent and student charter, and we welcome the general scheme of the education (parent and student charter) Bill.  The Bill broadly encapsulates the submissions and representations the NPC has made to the Department of Education and Skills and the Ministers over the past five years.  We know that when parents are engaged and involved in their children&rsquo;s education the children do better, and creating the right environment and culture in a school for parents and children to be active partners in school life is critical to this involvement.  The NPC believes the general scheme of the education (parent and student charter) Bill 2016 provides the legislative basis for the necessary change in schools to take place.<\/p><p> The NPC welcomes the statement of statutory principles under head 3 and agrees with all of the principles as laid out.  The NPC requests the inclusion of an additional principle, or the extension of the first principle, reflecting the values in the second principle.  This would give acknowledgement to the importance of the students' voice and participation in their own learning and progress.  This part of the Bill gives this to parents but we feel it could also be given to students.<\/p><p> The NPC supports the inclusion of head 4 and believes it is vital the Minister has powers to direct school boards to comply with the guidelines on the parent and student charter.  The NPC's survey in 2012 showed a lack of awareness by parents of Circular 24\/91 on parents as partners in education, and furthermore showed parents did not experience the provisions contained in the circular.  For example, Circular 24\/91 states each national school is required to establish as part of its overall school policy or plan, a clearly defined written policy for productive parental involvement.  The response from parents when asked if they knew whether their school had a parental involvement policy was that only 17% said they knew that their school did so.  It is vital that any legislation developed in this area is robust in ensuring parents and students are able to experience the benefits of its provisions.<\/p><p> The NPC particularly welcomes the expanded role of the Ombudsman for Children as set out in the general scheme.  The Education (Amendment) Bill 2015 is useful in setting out the challenges and possible way forward in addressing them.  The NPC believes the expanded role of the Ombudsman for Children, as set out in the education (parent and student charter) Bill, addresses the issues raised in the Education (Amendment) Bill and negates the need for a separate ombudsman for education.  The Education (Amendment) Bill drew attention to the deficiencies in the system that resulted in parents and students feeling they had nowhere to go with concerns and complaints if they felt their issues had not been addressed at school level.  Expanding the role of the Ombudsman for Children will address these issues and will ensure a one stop facility to which parents and students can go with their concerns.  As we know from other areas of policy and practice, dividing children's issues across Departments and services often leads to overlap and gaps, with significant work, financial resources and time spent establishing links.<\/p><p> The NPC welcomes the amendment to section 9 of the 1998 Act to insert the additional function of a school to promote the involvement of parents and students in the education provided to students.  The NPC believes head 9 completely supports the first principle outlined in head 3.  If the parent and student charter is underpinned by placing the student at the centre of school life and securing optimum outcomes for each student in his or her learning and holistic development, we know from research that parents are essential to the delivery of this principle, so ensuring a function of the school is to promote the involvement of parents and students in the education provided to students becomes vital.<\/p><p> The NPC supports the amendment of section 27 of the 1998 Act in clarifying the purpose of a student council in promoting the interests of students as distinct from the interests of the school.  The interests of the school will be better served if the student council promotes the interests of students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I thank everybody for their insights and observations on the Bills before us.

I appreciate many of them were made aware of the meeting at very short notice, and we appreciate the effort they have made.  This is an historic day, as it is the first time in the history of the Houses a Private Members' Bill and a Government Bill have been brought to committee side by side for pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is a very welcome development.  It is 20 years since the Education Act 1998, one of the most significant and progressive pieces of legislation brought through the Houses, and nothing has had the same impact on education.<\/p> <p>  I am not saying this in a boastful way, but there is no doubt none of this would be in this room if the Education (Amendment) Bill had not been published in 2015 and brought this issue to a head, albeit 20 years too late to enact section 28 of the Education Act.  The genesis of my Bill was frustration.  Coming from the inside, as I am a former principal as was acknowledged by Ms Dempsey for which I thank her, and now being a parent, and having dealt with boards of management and witnessed the trials and travails of other parents I was blown away.  This is because of the system we inherited, which probably goes back to the days of the church when the religious did the schooling for us and the State was able to operate a hands-off policy.  To this very day we take great advantage of this gap.  Most parents believe if a problem arises they can write to the Minister and get it sorted.  Of course we know they will be told the Minister has nothing at all to do with it and it is down to the board of management.  In my days as a principal I was told by someone in a trade union that the most important decision I would make as principal was to pick the parents on the board of management because I needed to surround myself with a good body of people who would say \"yes\" to me at all times.  This was the basis of the selection criteria for a board of management.  I understand the good reason for this.  It is not disparaging about anybody, it is just a fact of life.  The IPPN is before the committee representing principals.  I am a former member of the organisation, and I have great memories and great time for what it does, but I can understand how an ombudsman for education would not be popular with its members because it is another layer of scrutiny.<\/p> <p>  We must be mindful of the times in which we live.  Tonight I will be on Vincent Browne's television show and I will speak about the Grace case, the Tuam babies and all of the shames of our past.  We all have a responsibility to face up in the present and do what we can to bring openness and transparency.  We have a responsibility to do more than just defend our patch, which is the line I would like to bring across today.  If we do not accept this and move on in this spirit we will be back here again in 20 years time, hanging our heads in shame at what is wrong with the system.<\/p> <p>  The letters I have received from parents since I published the Bill three years ago are heartbreaking.  We see an 11 year old child in hospital with anorexia from being bullied at school by a relative of the principal, but nothing can be done about it by going to the board.  I could tell the committee story after story of heartache in the lives of real people.  The one voice that is missing from this room is that of the students.  They are not here today, which is telling in itself.  We must be very cognisant that the system we represent must bring forward the students' voice.<\/p> <p>  With regard to expanding the role of the Ombudsman for Children or whether we have a new ombudsman, I began this journey three years ago by publishing legislation to expand the role of the Ombudsman for Children to address educational issues.  At the time I was rebuffed by the same Ombudsman, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister of the day, who was a member of my party.  I was told the legislation would not fly and there was no need to expand the role of the Ombudsman for Children into educational matters, which was my specific objective.  Here we are, three years on, having come full circle and I am being told the solution to the problem is to expand the remit of the Ombudsman for Children, which is where I began three years ago.<\/p> <p>  This is not about right or wrong or about anybody having a monopoly on the right thing to do.  I was one of the first to quote the figure that almost half of complaints to the Ombudsman for Children relate to education.<\/p><p>Perhaps we could end all this and call it the education ombudsman as half the complaints to him are about education.  Maybe we could get over our hang-up with the title one way or the other.<\/p><p> I want to make a point on my Bill.  The legally binding powers aspect of it has been referred to by the Department and the Ombudsman for Children.  I made it quite clear on Second Stage that I have no difficulty with amending the legislation to remove the legally binding aspect of it.  I have no difficulty doing that and I want to put that on the record.  I am trying to get at educational welfare.  I have not seen it addressed in any of the submissions and I read every one of them before coming in here today.  People talk about the welfare of children but I am talking about the educational welfare of children.  There is a difference.  I became interested in that following a case submitted to the Ombudsman for Children where 39 students were put into junior and senior infants classes.  There should have been 24 in each class.  The principal wrote to the board of management to complain and asked if there should be a smaller number in junior or senior infants classes.  The board of management said that it was none of the principal's business and that it was the board of management.  Eventually a parent was forced to take it to the Ombudsman for Children.  I saw every letter from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children - there were numerous letters on this case - which it essentially said it had no remit.  I investigated it further.  There is an educational welfare issue where there are 39 students in a class.  It  is against the advice of the Department in that the smallest number of students should be in junior and senior infants.  There are 39 pupils in the class for no good reason but the Ombudsman for Children said he had no remit.  He has no remit because only their educational welfare is impacted.  They are not being beaten, starved or bullied.  Bullying is a grey area and I do not know if it is being addressed satisfactorily by the Ombudsman for Children.  Educational welfare is very different from other welfare and it is not being recognised or addressed.<\/p><p> Mr. Hanevy from the Department of Education and Skills gave a synopsis of the Bill.  We have had several conversations on it and I thank him for his engagement.  He made the point that if a parent had a grievance about the exclusion of a child from a school sports team, the parent could ask the ombudsman for education, if there was one, to exercise the power of direction to have the team's composition altered.  That is bordering on insulting because it is nonsensical and ridiculous.  The board of management is not responsible for the make-up of a school team.  I do not know of anywhere in the country where the board of management picks the team.  The team is picked by the teacher of sports on the day.  I am talking about decisions made by the board of management that should be appealed.  This is taking it a step too far and there is an over-emphasis on the legal side of it that we could all be tied up in courts for the rest of our lives.  I have accepted from the outset that I would be quite happy to remove that.<\/p><p> I have had discussions with Dr. Muldoon over a long time, including during his former role within the organisation.  One of the cases I read in his report was about a school had expelled a girl because she was pregnant.  A parent wrote to Dr. Muldoon and he carried out his investigation.  If my memory serves me correctly, he wrote to the school advising that it should admit the pregnant girl and had no grounds to expel her but from that day to this one, the letter was ignored.  That is my issue with this.  Even when Dr. Muldoon suggested something, he was ignored.  Some 95% or so of schools are good and are doing a wonderful job but when 5%, 2% or 1% are letting us down.  What are we going to do with them?  Children's livelihoods, education and well-being are all tied up in that.<\/p><p> I read Mr. Tyndall's submission with interest.  As I said to the Ombudsman for Children's office, he does not get the educational aspect of it.  He does not understand it.  He referred to 87 complaints about Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, or 82%.  They are about financial matters.  They are not educational complaints.  I do not see that as him addressing educational issues and educational welfare.  They are mathematical by nature and are related to accounting and somebody's income.  I am trying to make the point about the difference between educational welfare and financial welfare, general welfare and so on.  Mr. Tyndall mentioned access, finance and administration.  They are not really educational issues by nature.  If I was to ask Mr. Tyndall what he thinks of the ongoing teachers' dispute which is affecting only third years but will affect leaving certificate students shortly, which would come under his remit, what would he say?  I am not putting him on the spot, because I will not ask the question, but if I was to ask what he thinks of the teachers' refusal to correct their own children's work from an educational aspect and the protection of leaving certificate children, would he have a view on it?  I do not expect him to have one and am not asking that question.  That is the point I am trying to make.  An education ombudsman would be solely dedicated to educational issues.<\/p><p> On the proliferation of ombudsman offices, given the Grace case and Tuam Mother and Baby Home, I do not think we can have enough accountability.  Costs and delays were referred to.  One cannot put a price on a child's well-being or mental health, or the child who is in bed at 11 years of age with anorexia.  I cannot put a cost on that but if somebody has the expertise and interest to address the educational issues, I would not allow money to come in the way of that.  I have never been known for throwing money away either.<\/p><p> I thank Ms Dempsey for her forthright and honest comments.  They are welcome.  I thank her for her acknowledgement of my own comments.<\/p><p> The first time I saw the Irish Primary Principals' Network, IPPN, comment on it was in its magazine and I was touched by its concern for the national purse.  It is not a substantive reason to oppose it.  That was the first I saw of it.  It sees it as another layer.  I have no difficulty with the IPPN's opposition to it and understand that it represents principals who are people behind boards of management and may not want it opened up.  I would suggest it is not all but some of them.  I thank Ms Lynch for giving a balanced and welcome view on behalf of parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#H00300","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Daly.

I was committee-hopping today as committees are coinciding.  My colleague, Senator Fintan Warfield, was here to cover for me.  Deputy Carol Nolan is very much involved in the issue.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions in the previous D&aacute;il and Seanad, where we would have met with the Ombudsman on a regular basis.  One of the reports done by that committee was on looking at the power and the remit of the Ombudsman.  It made many recommendations about extending those.  It might be worth looking at that report in the context of this debate.  I appreciate the Bill is being brought forward in good faith.<\/p> <p>  From what I understand, a broader question has been alluded to in the debate which is that the power of the ombudsmen at the moment to do what they want to do, and should be able to do on behalf of the State, should be looked at.  They are quite hampered and that report will feed into this debate and show that there are mechanisms to extend the powers of the ombudsmen.  We need to ensure there is a mechanism available to anybody who has an issue with education to be able to bring it forward to one of the ombudsmen.  I am not 100% sure and I am happy to listen to the debate, which I welcome, as to whether we need a separate ombudsman.<\/p><p>At this stage I would not be sold on that debate, to be quite honest.  That is because there are certain areas that the children's ombudsman has been critical of, for example, including direct provision and children in that system who are trying to access third-level education.  Therefore we should also examine that report, as it would give us an insight into another facet of the debate.<\/p><p> This matter needs to be taken on board because it goes down to a core issue.  If a citizen wants to make a complaint it should be as easy as possible to do so.  It should be clear where a citizen must go to make a complaint.  We should also know that the person to whom the complaint is made has sufficient powers to deal with it and that the complainant can obtain redress.  In this scenario we need to clarify that pathway.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#J00700","speaker":"1377","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their presentations.

What is on offer regarding the parent and student charter is a phenomenal change of culture in the way forward for education.  We are putting children into the system for the first time.  It always irks me when I hear negotiations with the education partners that do not involve children.  Therefore we are putting a students' charter in place as well as for parents.  In turn, that means we are creating a new system of engagement with the authorities.  It will mean that parents should have a much more open and transparent engagement with schools.  In that way, principals will know that parents have an opportunity to engage with them on a more regular basis.<\/p> <p>  The charter will allow parents and children to highlight what they want from their school, and it will be the terms of reference for the school to work to.  It will also have a set of principles which are clear and concise, and which will refer to matters such as children's rights.  It will allow the child to be heard, which is an article of the UNCRC, as well as allowing the child's views to be listened to and followed up on.  In addition, it will allow the child not to be discriminated against.  This will not only concern students' councils, but will need to engage with all children across the board.  It will also have to encompass children with special needs, and education and welfare difficulties.  It is creating a whole new culture.<\/p> <p>  While there will be changes, the most important one is the ability to get a directive from the Minister.  That is what changes the concerns we had.  Deputy Daly cited the example of a pregnant teenager who is not allowed to go to school.  Even when the child was born, the mother was still not allowed to attend that school.  That could have been avoided if my office had the power to seek a ministerial directive.  It would probably have changed the way in which the principal dealt with us also because he would have known we had that option.  That is the greatest achievement coming from today's work and it is something to be proud of.  All the negotiations that have occurred so far change the way boards and principals have to look at things.<\/p> <p>  It is not something that will happen every day.  We are talking about a small number.  The psychological pressure on parents was mentioned, because essentially one comes to a dead end if boards do not listen to parents.  If they come to us and we cannot engage any further with them, that is a dead end.  That is what has been happening.  My ability to bring the Department of Education and Skills into it in a more realistic manner has changed as a result of this measure.<\/p> <p>  I want to counter what Deputy Jim Daly said.  It is unfair to characterise our office as not dealing with the educational welfare of children.  It is an unfair characterisation of our office to say that we only deal with bullying, child protection and beaten children.  There are clear examples to the contrary.  We have already highlighted the idea of educational welfare for children with special accommodation for the leaving and junior certificates.  We worked hard on that issue and created a report for the State Examinations Commission.  <\/p> <p>  We have also commissioned research on children in care in education and the welfare system they require.  We have examined designations that will be coming through the Education (Admissions) Bill soon.  That provides a designation for children who did not get access to school, as well as for special needs children.  We had a long engagement with the Department over those investigations out of which the designations have come.<\/p> <p>  We have also been involved in investigations concerning preschool children with special needs who could not get special needs assistants and were not able to access the free school year.  That has led to the new aims scheme that is now coming on board.  We therefore have a huge engagement with education and welfare, and our office does that all the time.  Some 45% of our work concerns the education remit.  <\/p> <p>  It was clearly stated that the idea of an education ombudsman is to be solely dedicated to educational welfare.  By its nature, however, one cannot engage with other aspects concerning children.  We do not need to silo children any further, we need to engage across the remit and we do that continually.  Every day of the week we deal with children who have problems getting school transport, as well as those with special needs, including occupational or speech and language therapy.<\/p> <p>  When we have child protection issues, that concerns Tusla, we engage across all Departments.  That allows us to see the whole child and not just the educational aspects.  To cement us into one more little silo is to the detriment of schools, parents and children.  That is the crucial part for us.  <\/p> <p>  It is important for the message to go out that the overall culture is changing and will allow us to examine the role of school boards and principals in order to do something about that.  We can certainly make improvements through the parent and student charter.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman said, this is a historical step forward from 1998 when section 28 was never even touched.  We have constantly asked for the tripod of complaints mechanism - the Teaching Council, section 28 and ourselves - to be in place.  We were working on our own for the past 20 years, but now have the Teaching Council and a brand new section 28 through the parent and student charter.  That will make a huge difference to those difficult cases that we all want to see being improved.<\/p> <p>  We want to take away the pain and psychological trauma, both for parents and children, when a board is stubborn, recalcitrant and does not go any further.  This represents a huge step forward. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Deputy Jim Daly was very eloquent in support of the principles he is seeking to have built into the ombudsman system and I have no quarrel with him in that regard.  It is clear that issues about educational welfare should be addressed in the context of an ombudsman's scheme.  My particular issue with it was whether that could be most quickly and effectively addressed by the extension of powers under and the remit of the existing scheme or whether it was necessary to create a new one.<\/p> <p>  The issue of recommendations being ignored is one that tends not to affect, as I said, ombudsmen working wholly within the public sector.  It is the particular role of schools and school boards which fall outside the power of direction that causes many of the difficulties the Deputy properly identified.  As I said, within the private sector it is normal for ombudsmen to have binding powers and for the organisations within their remit to have to comply with their recommendations, unless they take court action.  As the Deputy acknowledged, this potentially leads to many judicial reviews, which is not helpful.  The proposals to allow the Minister to make binding directions are an excellent compromise, one which balances the traditional ombudsman model and the quasi-independence or independence of boards of governors in a way that would ensure recommendations were not ignored.  As the Deputy stated, in all of these matters it is the small minority of cases in which problems arise that consistently provide the work for ombudsman schemes. <\/p> <p>  Although the Office of the Ombudsman deals with welfare issues, they tend to be student welfare issues within the further and higher education sector or, as Dr. Muldoon described, issues around access to support for leaving certificate students sitting examinations.  They are crucial and occupy a considerable amount of time for both offices.  The existence of both offices has led to major systemic change in the way this support is provided.  This shows the capacity of ombudsmen to take individual complaints and turn them into real and lasting change for a much larger number of people than come to our offices.<\/p> <p>  While I take the point that some of the work we do is about funding, I must also note that a significant educational welfare issue arises where a student is told midway through the second year of a degree course that his or her funding is about to be withdrawn and, what is more, that all funding received thus far must be repaid.  These matters have an impact. <\/p> <p>  The quickest and most effective way to realise the aspirations the Deputy set out for improvements in access to redress in schools would be to ensure the Ombudsman for Children, in particular, had the necessary changes to powers and resources to enable his office to deliver effective redress in the circumstances about which the Deputy is concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Deputy Jim Daly asked what we did about the 2% of schools.  Our purpose is not to take the offensive against all schools in the State system; we certainly do not portray a picture of principals running mini-cabals with boards of management.  However, the issue is one of deciding what to do about the 0.1%, 2%, 3% or 5% of schools where problems arise.  Some boards operate dysfunctional decision-making practices and some principals take issues very personally when a parent raises a difficulty in the provision of special educational needs support for a child or makes a complaint about one of a myriad of other issues in a school.  The issue arises when the complaint is compounded by not being addressed, despite the intervention of other agencies.<\/p> <p>  We know special educational needs organisers, SENOs, who will act as advocates on behalf of a parent and a child.  However, it is not within their remit to act in that capacity, yet they will try to act as mediators.  I am aware that there are proposals to include this in the remit of SENOs in the new inclusion support service.  SENOs do not have any say in the decision a school can make.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the cohort of people we represent, namely, parents of children with special needs, we interface with health and educational support services all the time, of which there is a severe lack.  A therapist may come to a school to enable it to deal with difficulties arising from a child's disability.  When this is not taken on board and a situation breaks down, it may lead to a breakdown of the school placement.  Despite the parent trying to act as an advocate on behalf of his or her child and work in a collaborative fashion with the school, the interpersonal relationship between the parent and the principal may break down.  When trying to navigate a solution, the parent may go through the official complaints procedure which leads to the board of a management which consistently sides with the principal.  We have even seen this happen in cases in which an accusation of assault was made against a member of staff or the principal.  These cases occurred prior to the Teaching Council being given the power to enforce disciplinary actions.  The 2% of schools with which we must deal are those where the board of management shuts down in the face of the problems I described.  I have personal experience of such cases.  Changing culture for the main school body may bring about a change for the 2% of schools where there may be peer pressure.  They may deal with matters in a certain way or perhaps the operation of the boards might need to be examined.<\/p> <p>  I have a list of telephone numbers which I give to parents who do not know how to navigate the system.  Some parents contact me to tell me they have been in touch with the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  I tell them to call the Irish Primary Principals Network and provide it with information on what is happening in the school in question.  Depending on who answers the telephone, the parent may be directed to a colleague who will offer advice.  In such cases the organisation is at least aware of what is happening in the 2% of schools, even though it is not within its capacity to sort out the issue.  We direct parents in the direction of the IPPN to ensure it notes that there is a problem in certain schools. <\/p> <p>  I note that the parent and student charter which would be more appropriately titled the student and parent charter proposes oversight mechanisms where required.  It does not appear that it will provide for the strong arm of the Minister in relation to all activities in schools.  It deals with the 2% of schools where there are no other avenues of redress for parents and children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":281,"content":"<p>The parent charter was conceived more than five years ago.  The elements of the charter related to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children were included because Deputy Jim Daly, in conversation with the Minister, identified particular aspects of the current operation of the system that could be improved.  It was an attempt to make improvements.<\/p> <p>  The last thing I want is to be insulting.  The committee, possibly for the first time, asked the Department to provide a briefing on a Private Members' Bill, not just on its own, which is new and part of new politics and so on.  In attempting to do this faithfully the only point I was making was that the Bill did not provide for many exemptions.  For example, the terms and conditions of teachers are excluded from the legislation covering the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  This means that since there are no boundaries, everything in a school comes before an ombudsman who will be in a binding space or make absolute determinations.  The example I used - there is empathy in this - of the row about the composition of the school table was given because one of my colleagues in the office was telling me about the experience in a primary school outside Athlone where the principal's child was on the team when everyone knew ten other children were ahead of him. <\/p> <p>  Much of the debate is about what happens at the back end.<\/p><p>What we are really trying to do in the charter is change things at the front end.  That came from a piece of research a colleague did for a Master's degree about how public services are delivered.  If one listens to the people who experience the service wilfully and openly, one can solve many things because one knows what is bothering people and what are their problems.  One then minimises the stuff at the back end.  In the detail of charter, we see parent power as being very important.  In respect of the reporting that must be done within the guidelines, there will be template guidelines so that they are universal.  They will have to explain the complaints they received in any one year.  Anonymity would have to apply but the totality of the parent body would be able to see exactly what was dealt with in the course of the year.  The reputational damage schools can suffer if they do not operate properly under the charter, for example, if a school feels it is going to be damned in the local newspaper, can often be potent in bringing about change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Hanevy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>The role of a school principal is ultimately about the welfare of children.  It is about teaching and learning in a school community and we take it very seriously.  No school is perfect and we know that as an association because boards of management are not perfect.  They were introduced in 1975.  As an organisation, we feel that there is significant room for reform there, and I can empathise with the committee's frustration at times.  We make significant efforts to encourage the best possible practice.  When we talk about 2% or whatever the percentage of schools where there is a difficulty, we feel parents should be able to put their case to a formal body.  In fairness to the Ombudsman for Children's office, about which I recently wrote in our magazine and whose powers many of our colleagues were not aware of, it has dealt with over 3,000 complaints.  We have 4,000 schools.  One complaint related to special needs education where the parents were unhappy with the way the child was being resourced.  The Ombudsman for Children's office was not afraid to come in and slap down the school's board of management on the basis that the special educational needs policy was outdated.  It advised the school on a new policy.  Ultimately, the Ombudsman for Children's office approached it very well and the outcomes were good in the end.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jim Daly's Bill has much to commend it but we are not afraid of scrutiny.  We have the inspectorate, which is part of the DNA of schools.  We have educational welfare officers and the Teaching Council of Ireland and that is all good.  Ultimately, if we see another body doing the work the Ombudsman for Children's office can do, why introduce another layer?  By all means, everything that happens in a school should be scrutinised.  Ultimately, it is the relationship between the primary educators, who are the parents, and the school that drives on things.  Every school aspires to the best.  There are some good points in the Education (Amendment) Bill but we just do not like the way it will create another layer.  If the good parts are taken out of it and given to the Ombudsman for Children's office, we will be happy with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Ruddy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>One of the things about which we would be very cautious is that the parent-student charter and the Ombudsman for Children's office are not seen as the answer to all issues relating to school boards of management.  We will badly affect the powers of the office of the Ombudsman for Children and the parent-student charter if we try to use both of those mechanisms to fix all of the issues around school boards of management.  That is a separate piece of work that needs to be looked and I would caution against that.<\/p> <p>  I would happily endorse Dr. Muldoon's assertion that it should be the student-parent charter.  Parents would very much want the students at the forefront and centre of it and believe that it is their role to support them.  It has been outlined how the different layers can be difficult for parents.  Other colleagues of mine have recently been involved in looking at the child protection guidelines in schools and how they need to be revised in terms of Children First.  In respect of the interplay between the Department of Education and Skills, Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in trying to make sure all of those things are put in place at the same time, the fact that children's issues are separated out over so many Departments is utterly frustrating and certainly not in the best interests of protecting children.  It is really important that children's issues are kept in a cohesive way wherever we currently have them.  Trying to pull back in situations where Departments have already separated out children's issues can be very difficult, but to start separating things out when children are clearly under the remit of one ombudsman will lead to further frustration for parents in terms of how they can manage certain situations.  Children do not fit into nice packages so a complaint is rarely just an education issue.  It often touches other areas of the child's life so it would be very frustrating for parents if they were constantly being knocked from pillar to post within the complaints system at ombudsman level as well because they experience this quite a lot before they even get there.  I would caution against that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank members for all the very specific issues they have raised because it is very interesting for us to get that kind of information and to reflect on it.  We would say as an office that the Department of Education and Skills needs to reflect on how boards of management need to improve in terms of best practice.  That is something with which we would agree.  The IPPN and other organisations would also agree with that.  We are not a panacea for all ills.  In terms of oversight relating to how schools deal with grievances, the Ombudsman for Children's office thinks that the parent-student charter has significant potential.  This is the first building block.  As Mr. Hanevey said, when schools have to be more open and transparent in respect of complaints and how they are dealt with, that information is there.  Oversight mechanisms within the Department can be further developed and improved.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the role of our office, we have a broad remit.  In respect of educational welfare, we have an amazing power under our Act, particularly section 7, where we not only look at the investigation of complaints, but at the rights and welfare of the child under section 7.  We work cross-functionally as a team so that where systemic issues arise that cannot be addressed in respect of the admissibility of a complaint or where a complaint may not meet the threshold of what is required to investigate, we do not just drop these issues.  We take them on board.  There are massive problems with regard to special educational needs because the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act has not been implemented.  There is a right to an assessment but no right to what comes out of that assessment.  These are often issues where, with the best will in the world and following through on an investigation, we still end up with a road block so it is just not about schools.  There is a range of issues where our office is in a position to advise about how the rights and welfare of children can be improved.  We are learning all the time as an office.<\/p> <p>  I draw attention to the nuances within what is proposed in subsection 16 because what has been drafted by the Department not only relates to recommendations for our office where the complaint has met the threshold for investigation and has gone forward, but it also applies to the large amount of work our office does at the local resolution phase.  What is fantastic about the charter is that it is fully reflective of the way our office works and what we want to build upon, which is improving how schools operate at a local level, transparency, accountability and all the frustrations about communicating with parents shutting down.  They are issues that the principles of the charter address.  This is what we want to see changing.<\/p> <p>  In respect of suggestions and guidance, the wording of what is proposed is so important because it is not only talking about where an investigation has been conducted, but there are options to lay a report before the Oireachtas.  There have been a small number of situations where that has not been possible because we were protecting a child.  It also applies to the local resolution phase where a complaint has not met the threshold for investigation because of the criteria relating to the Act but where it is a serious issue.  The office works very hard to make suggestions, give encouragement and make recommendations to a school.<\/p><p>It is true that sometimes there are situations where boards do not carry through on that.<\/p><p> This legislation provides an additional stick where we can say there is another power and they should listen to what we are saying.  I would highlight that in Section 7 of the Act there is a provision around best practice guidance for schools in regard to the rights and welfare of the child.  We are about to publish a golden rules and complaints handling procedure, which the office was working on prior to the current proposals and which places the child at the centre of all of this.  There is excellent research on child-friendly complaints mechanisms.  We will have that as a resource for schools.  We would say that the Department of Education needs to present what is best practice for schools.  The parent and student charter is the way forward to improve all of that but it is a process and it is going to take time, it will not change everything overnight.  We as an office intend to work with that.<\/p><p> On educational welfare, the amendments will allow the educational charter to fall under the remit of our office.  That would broaden what is covered by maladministration.  We will look at how schools are implementing the charter.  That is a space we have not quite figured out yet but that will broaden what we are looking at.  It will still mean that we are not getting involved in adjudicating in the nitty-gritty of everything that goes on in the school, nor should we because that would not be best practice and it would not be practical.  However, we do think these proposals have huge potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n Webb","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":287,"content":"<p>We came from a conference this morning on the role of the principal and looking at the importance of principals spending more time on the actual business of teaching and learning.

We as a society owe a great deal to the parents who serve on boards of management.  Without them we would be in a much weaker position.  When my children were going to school it was very difficult to get parents to go on boards of management and I am interested if it has become any easier in the period since then.  I am aware of difficulties in a local rural area where there were problems.  Sometimes, for members of boards of management, where issues are not resolved to a satisfactory level for those involved, there can be a historic aspect that goes on in the community where people can be divided, sometimes for a very long time thereafter.  That is very unfortunate.  It is not for today, but maybe a discussion on boards of management like Ms Dempsey mentioned, would be very worthwhile and is something that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I am heartened by the charter.  I am happy about Dr Muldoon's contribution and that in the future the Minister will be able to make a binding decision in regard to any issue.  For all involved it is a good thing to have on the table so that everyone knows from the get-go that if the people involved cannot find a resolution then ultimately the Minister can make a direction.  That is very helpful and it might focus the minds of all involved from the outset.  <\/p> <p>  I am easy about whether we carry on and extend the office as it is or establish a new office.  I would be inclined to work with what we have in the interim to see how that works out.

Then there will be individual charters by school, because obviously there cannot be a one-size fits all as there is huge variation in the make-up of school communities.  How will the consultation with parents and students in the individual schools work?  In the more disadvantaged areas it can be impossible to get a parent to turn up to a parent-teacher meeting.  If it is a student council, often it is the most vulnerable, most needy child that does not put themselves up for election, so how will their voice be heard in that context?<\/p> <p>  I refer to Mr. Cotrell's remarks.  Will it be the principal who will drive the individual charter in the school, as secretary to the board of management?  I wholeheartedly agree that principals and senior management, due to the moratorium, are under serious work over-load.  I am aware of a principal in a DEIS school who works as the principal, the assistant principal - which in this case is the year-head where there are huge pastoral care issues because it is a DEIS school - and is also now the student council  teacher because they cannot get the B post replaced.  When we talk about the welfare of students, there are huge issues that need to be addressed, and not just dealt with in the parent and student charter.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Dempsey raised an interesting point that the balance of power is often with the board of management,.  That is problematic when there is a perception that it is swayed by principals.  Has the Department considered re-examining the make-up of boards of management?

My response to that viewpoint, is that there is a Department and a Minister with responsibility for Education and Skills and a Department and Minister with responsibility for Health.  That is the way we organise our administration.  It would not be the worst idea to have an ombudsman, who would be independent, to have oversight of a Department of Education and Skills with a budget of &euro;8 billion.<\/p><p> I would like to hear the officials comment on educational welfare.  I see evidence of the acknowledgement of educational welfare along with physical, spiritual and emotional welfare.  Ultimately I am trying to achieve recognition of educational welfare.  I have tabled a parliamentary question on the number of complaints from schools on an annual basis.  Many parents would not know about the role of the Ombudsman for Children and would not think to make a complaint about a problem in school to the Ombudsman.  I would appreciate if the witnesses would provide the committee with the figures for the number of complaints.<\/p><p> I accept the Primary Principals Network, IPPN, has a contention about another layer of administration, in addition to the Teaching Council and the National Education Welfare Board.  I understand there is no layer dealing with boards of management and I accept if the Minister can take responsibility for boards of management through the Ombudsman for Children, we are bridging that gap.  To broaden the focus of the role of an ombudsman for education, it would not be just about complaints and grievances, it is only because I respect the work of both Mr. Peter Tyndall, Ombudsman and Information Commissioner and Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children and their respective offices, that I have such high regard and a strong desire to see an ombudsman specifically dedicated to education.  It is not a negative reflection on their offices.<\/p><p> I see the role of an ombudsman as being far greater than dealing with grievances.  The crucial role of an ombudsman is to lobby and to hold Government to account and to write reports on aspects of failings in the system and putting it up to Government to come forward.  School principals have an extraordinary workload.  I was a school principal and it was the most thankless job I ever did.  The job I am doing now is not hugely rewarding but I would never be a teaching principal.  I would not recommend being one in its current format.  I would like to see an education ombudsman who would be responsible solely for issues of education tackling that kind of issue.  It needs to be highlighted for Government that what is expected of teaching principals is grossly irresponsible.  I would see an ombudsman as a strength in dealing with this and other such issues.  The need for an ombudsman for education is a debate for another day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#N01100","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Daly.

We strayed, rightfully, into the issue of boards of management, their composition and how they are structured at present.  There is definitely work to be done in that area.  The boards of management of the 3,200  primary schools changed in the past year.  The model for the composition of boards has been in place since 1998, but an issue that was raised as a possible change when the Department was working with the partners this year was changing the role of the school principal from being a voting member of the board to attending the board.  That would mean the board could make its decisions without the principal being present.  That is good governance in most places.  The only partner that supported the Department in the working group was the National Parents Council Primary.  All the other partners, unions, the IPPN and the management bodies were not having it.  That is not to say we will not continue to persevere for it.  There is an issue about how the boards of small schools are serviced and how they can be serviced.  Even the IPPN has done work in the past about the division of the governance.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the charter, we are working with our partners on the child protection area at present because we know the safeguarding statements that will have to be provided when the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs commences the Children First legislation.  We will be creating a template.  There will be a great many common requirements in the charter, in terms of information for parents, the type of complaints procedure and how you engage people.  We will have a standard part but equally I take the Deputy's point about the disadvantaged.  We are quite seized about how the charter may have to be tapered.  The beauty of guidelines as distinct from regulations is that one can more readily taper the components to the needs of a special school for example.<\/p> <p>  There will be a lot of spoon-feeding because we want these things done.  I hear Mr. Se&aacute;n Cottrell's point.  Certainly, if the Oireachtas enacts this legislation, when we lead the work with the partners to take the flesh that is in the principles it and create the living charter, schools will be following that template.  I do not want to see that as bureaucracy, I want to see the purpose, which is a changed attitude.  I do see where there is extra work in simply asking people how they feel the school is going, inviting feedback in a simple questionnaire or simply at the end of the day setting out the number and type of complaints so that the entire parent body gets that type of information.  In the primary schools where the pupils must do 183 days, one time the Department used to police that, and we would receive letters that a school only did 180 days because a boiler burst.  That is a simple piece of information that should be included when the school reports to its parents at the end of the year.  How many of the 183 days did it make and, when it did not meet the 183 school days, to report the reason.  I do not see why anybody should be afraid to report that to the parent body.  There are charges that I do not think will involve extra work, but will be a change of mindset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Hanevy"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hanvey.

I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the overview of the operations of the national lottery.  The national lottery is an area of huge importance to the retail agents I represent.  It is also a key issue for this House as the national lottery is different from ordinary gaming in that it is operated under a State licence and was established to generate money for good causes.<\/p> <p>  The independent community retailers that RGDATA represent have played a key role in the success of the national lottery since it was first launched in 1988.  We certainly believe that our model of responsible retailing in the community assisted the national lottery to establish itself and develop into a well-regarded institution that attracted a significant price tag when the Government put a 20-year licence to operate the national lottery up for sale.<\/p> <p>  In general our members' relations with Premier Lotteries Ireland, PLI, the new operators of the national lottery have been positive and constructive.  While there were some initial transitional issues as PLI took over the national lottery franchise, thankfully the sort of technical issues which led to outages and the cancellation of a national lottery draw in 2015 have diminished.  PLI has also shown itself to be proactive in managing its relations with the national lottery agents and we welcome that.<\/p> <p>  As can be expected, PLI, as a commercial company that made a significant investment in the national lottery, will take whatever steps are necessary to build and grow its business in Ireland.  Retailers welcome any efforts to increase the retail sale of national lottery products, the prizes and the money raised for good causes and will continue to be responsible retailers within their local communities.  PLI can be expected to maximise the opportunities to grow its business operations here and to secure a return on the &euro;405 million it paid for the 20-year operating licence for the national lottery.  This is a fair and legitimate aspiration on its part, which should yield greater sales, more prizes and greater returns to good causes.  Of course PLI will do what it can to get a return on its business investment.  As the company itself states, \"PLI's mission is to operate a world class lottery for the people of Ireland, raising important funds for good causes, on behalf of the Irish Government\".<\/p> <p>  It was recognised at the time of the sale that it would be important to have an independent body overseeing the operation of the national lottery, protecting players' interests, the common good and ensuring the lottery was run in accordance with the licence.  Hence, the new licensing structure for the national lottery also saw the establishment of the first national lottery regulator in Ireland in 2014.  While the new regulator has needed time to establish and to start to build up expertise and knowledge we think that three years down the road the committee should review the role and function of the national lottery regulator.<\/p> <p>  From an RGDATA perspective and as significant stakeholders, there are some specific areas where we believe the national lottery regulator needs to become more public, find its voice and make its priorities and activities better known to the wider public.  I am not sure what the experience of this committee has been but, to date, RGDATA has heard very little from the regulator since the office was established and we would encourage a more open and active profile for this important role.<\/p> <p>  Let me give some examples of how the national lottery regulator plays a pivotal role.  The first area relates to technical issues.  In 2015 there was a significant technical issue concerning the national lottery which led to a draw being postponed for the first time in the history of the national lottery.  There were also some additional technical outages and incidents since then.  The technical integrity of the national lottery is of primary importance for players and retailers.  To date, no independent and authoritative explanation has been provided for the outages.  Retailers believe the regulator should be active in securing explanations for when the system fails and providing stakeholders with details of the problems and the measures taken to ensure they do not recur.<\/p> <p>  It is also important that the regulator regularly audits the technical performance of the national lottery and reports this information fully.  The growth in online gaming is another area where we believe the regulator needs to step up to the plate and demonstrate that the office is protecting the interests of players, the national lottery and the broader community.  At present there are 21 different instant games that can be played online on the national lottery website in addition to the national lottery and EuroMillions draws.  Players registered with the national lottery online are subject to spending limits of &euro;75 per day, &euro;300 per week and &euro;900 per month.  While most of the online games are replicas of the instant win or draws available in retail outlets, there are two that are entirely new and present an exclusive online playing opportunity, namely, Instant Lotto and Mini Keno.  The online games can be played on mobile devices any time, any place and anywhere so they raise issues for those disposed to gaming addiction that are less likely to arise in a traditional retail agent transaction.<\/p> <p>  The national lottery regulator should outline the measures that have been taken to protect vulnerable players and to replicate the types of controls on purchases in traditional shops.  It would also be helpful to get some data from the regulator on the profile and patterns of online purchases of national lottery products.  The impact of the rapid roll-out of online lottery products must be assessed independently and objectively.<\/p> <p>  We would also like to know if the national lottery regulator is monitoring the huge growth in online lotto sites with no links to the actual licensed national lotteries.<\/p><p>They offer punters the opportunity to gamble on the results of lotteries all around the world.<\/p><p> These sites have no obligations to contribute towards good causes.  All one has to do is google \"Play Lotto Online\" and one will get 16.5 million hits in less than one third of a second.  This has huge implications for how people play national lotteries and I make no bones about the fact that they are a huge threat to the retail agents I represent who are selling legitimate tickets that deliver funds to good causes.  The UK has proposed new legislation to make it a requirement for any gambling site wishing to advertise its services within the UK and accept UK customers to hold a licence issued directly by the UK Gambling Commission rather than the current position whereby the sites can operate with licences issued by a whitelisted gambling jurisdiction.  RGDATA respectfully suggests that the committee should investigate if we should do something similar here.<\/p><p> The growth in agents is another area I would like to touch on.  The national lottery intends to create a national lottery everywhere model, which will increase the opportunities for the public to buy lottery tickets in a host of new outlets and at new opportunities.  This will be achieved in part through deals with online payment services operators that have configured their devices to print out lottery tickets.  This will lead to a rapid explosion in the availability of the national lottery - a national lottery everywhere model with the lotto potentially being available in bookshops, cafes, restaurants, barbers - basically any outlet that has a point of sale terminal.  Has the regulator assessed the impact of such an extension of the availability of the national lottery?  How has he equated it with the licence condition for the operator of the lottery not to apply different commission structures to retail agents?<\/p><p> I refer to the national lottery and licensed premises.  It was a condition of the national lottery licence that no agents would be appointed in licensed premises where alcohol is sold for consumption on the premises.  This recognises two issues - first, the national lottery is different to ordinary gaming; it is operated under a State licence and aims to generate money for good causes.  It also recognises the risk of associating gaming with alcohol.  The irony is that the growth in online national lottery activity has effectively rendered the prohibition on sales of tickets in licensed outlets to be a fiction.  Players can now log onto their phones and play any one of 21 instant games in the pub subject only to the daily spending limit.  Has the regulator a view on this issue?  What research has his office carried out on the patterns of use and implications of such gaming?<\/p><p> It is important that the national lottery regulator increases its public profile and engagement with stakeholders in respect of the important role that the Oireachtas has conferred on it.  The regulator needs to demonstrate effectiveness in promoting the protection of the public interest in its operations and formal engagement by the regulator with the committee will be a key part of providing clarity on the regulator&rsquo;s role and function.  Ideally, the regulator should use its website and other media fora to provide details of reports on any technical outages involving the national lottery; measures taken by it to protect player interests; the extent to which it has approved or rejected new games submitted by approval by PLI; the research that it has undertaken on gaming patterns and habits in Ireland and how these feed into the regulatory function; the types of approvals sought for new agents to be appointed; details of any gaps in the regulatory protection for the public necessitated since the agency was set up; details of how it expends resources; and details of consumer complaints made and resolved concerning the national lottery.<\/p><p> RGDATA fully accepts that the regulator has a new brief and seems not to have had a significant level of expertise within his office from people formerly involved in regulating lotteries.  There has, therefore, been a steep learning curve.  At the same time, PLI has ramped up considerably its expansion of the national lottery and its plans to become a &euro;1 billion business and it is important that all stakeholders, including the public and retail agents, are confident that an active regulator is on the job.  I thank the committee and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Has RGDATA had direct engagement with the regulator?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030700002#D00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>When the regulator was appointed, we met him and we attended a previous meeting of the committee at which he was also present.

At the outset, and to put my presentation in context, I consider it useful to set out the respective roles of the operator and the regulator, which are set out in the national lottery Act 2013, and the licence to operate the national lottery.  Under the Act, the operator has \"the sole purpose of operating the National Lottery in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licence\".  The operator must report to the regulator on its activities and it must appear before this committee when requested to do so.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform awarded a 20-year licence to the operator, Premier Lotteries Ireland, PLI, on 27 February 2014 and PLI began operating the national lottery on 30 November 2014.<\/p> <p>  I was appointed as the first regulator from 17 November 2014.  Prior to that, the Minister acted as regulator.  Since establishment, we have put in place an expert team to regulate the market.  Our team includes regulatory, risk management, audit, accountancy, psychology and legal expertise.  I am an actuary with more than 25 years experience working in regulatory areas in the private and public sectors.  I am joined today by the deputy regulator and head of audit and finance, Mr. Derek Donohoe, who is a former partner in a leading Irish accountancy practice with significant experience of auditing, forensic accounting, corporate governance and compliance.<\/p> <p>  The functions of the regulator under the Act are to procure the holding of the national lottery; to monitor and enforce compliance by the operator with the Act and the licence; to exercise enforcement rights of any trade mark of the national lottery; to consider for approval certain matters relating to the national lottery, including schemes for national lottery games; and to manage and control the national lottery fund.<\/p> <p>  In carrying out these functions, the regulator&rsquo;s objectives are probity, participant protection, sustainability and, subject to the foregoing, maximising returns for good causes.  Accordingly, the regulator monitors and enforces compliance by the operator with the Act and the licence and considers - and approves or declines to approve - proposals relating to certain matters received from the operator.  Where an operational matter does not require approval and does not breach a term of the Act or the licence, this is a matter for the operator.  I hope the committee will understand that, in my presentation, we may at times only be able to speak in general terms.  This is because, like other regulators, our role requires that we respect commercially sensitive and confidential information.<\/p> <p>  In relation to compliance by the operator with the requirements of the Act and the licence, the regulator continuously monitors the activities of the operator.<\/p><p>Such monitoring includes oversight of data and systems of the operator.  This is real-time access and includes, for example, monitoring sales and cash flows.  It also includes oversight of the independent control system, which duplicates the activities of the operator's business system and provides an important verification tool.  We carry out reviews of the operator's processes and controls.  For example, we have conducted reviews of the operator's processes for risk management, anti-fraud, prizes management and fitness and probity.  We have reviews of specific matters, such as technology outages.  We receive and review of regular reports from the operator, including management reports, reports on IT performance and trading reports.  We monitor those.  We review arrangements for and the output of the operator's internal and external audits.  An area on which we are very focused is the ongoing review of online play, including the controls set out in the licence, but also play activity.  We get data on this from the operator regularly.<\/p><p> Our oversight informs our considerations when proposals put to us by the operator are being assessed for approval.  In doing this work, we have overseen enhancements in a number of areas, including risk management, internal audit, governance of information and communication technology and controls for online play.  <\/p><p> With regard to proposals from the operator, we consider requests for approval of certain matters, which, under the Act and the licence, require the approval of the regulator.  Such matters include codes of practice for advertising and promotion, sales, participant relations and employee vetting, in addition to proposals relating to schemes for lottery games and third party providers.  <\/p><p> In total, the operator has submitted 69 requests for approval.  These were considered in accordance with the Act and the licence, and on 60 of the occasions further information was sought by the regulator or the operator chose to submit amended requests for approval, or both.  Ultimately, 59 submissions received from the operator have been approved.  <\/p><p> A key function of the regulator is to manage and control the national lottery fund.  We review weekly detailed financial reports and receive and disburse funds as provided for in the licence.  Under the licence, the amount allocated to good causes is equal to 65% of the difference between total net sales and the amount in respect of prizes.  In 2016, &euro;218.9 million was transferred for good causes, &euro;7 million of which related to sales in previous years.  In 2015, &euro;193.3 million was transferred in respect of good causes.<\/p><p> Reports we have received from the operator in respect of 2016 include the following in regard to the operation of the national lottery.  In 2016, 1.4 million people played lottery games on a regular basis, representing more than 40% of the adult population, and almost 70% of the adult population played the game occasionally.<\/p><p> Ticket sales for 2016 amounted to &euro;750 million.   The figure for 2015 was &euro;670 million.  Sales for draw-based games amounted to &euro;530 million, while scratch card and online instant-win games generated &euro;220 million.  With respect to the sales channel, which includes sales for draw-based games and instant games, 95% of sales were retail, while 5% were online.  <\/p><p> With regard to the retail estate, the number of retail outlets increased by approximately 1,500 to 5,200 since the commencement of operations under the licence.  Around half of the increase relates to the availability of lottery games being extended from approximately one third of post offices to all post offices, including all sub-post offices.  It is noted that most of the increased retail estate provides a restricted service in terms of the range of games and the options available.  Of course, it is important to note the same controls in respect of probity and player protection and all the rules set out in the licence in respect of retailers apply equally in respect of the new outlets.<\/p><p> With regard to systems availability in 2016, over the whole network, terminals were available to sell tickets 99.9% of the time on average.  Availability of website services varied from 99.6% of the time to 99.8% of the time.<\/p><p> I hope that the presentation has been helpful for the committee in providing an overview of the operations of the national lottery and of the role of the regulator of the national lottery.  I look forward to answering members questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Sloyan","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488902400,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Senator Gerry Horkan took the Chair at 5.23 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sloyan and Mr. Donohoe for their attendance and their opening remarks on behalf of the regulator.

This company is marketing the products and giving advice to retailers on how they can push sales.  There is a significant gambling problem in the State.

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Elaine Breslin, the clinical assessment manager.  Further to our statement to the committee on 24 November 2016, we are pleased to discuss the HPRA report, Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review, which was submitted to the Minister for Health on 31 January and subsequently published by the Minister on 10 February.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the Minster asked the HPRA in November last year to provide scientific advice on the use of cannabis for medical purposes.  We were also requested to review the situation regarding the medical use of cannabis in other countries.  The role of the HPRA includes the evaluation of the benefits and risks of medicines on the basis of scientific evidence, prior to granting a marketing authorisation.  The evidence for the use of many cannabis products is insufficient to permit a conventional benefit-risk evaluation, or authorisation as medicines.  As such, we have concluded as an outcome of our review that we cannot recommend widespread access to cannabis for the treatment of a range of medical conditions.  However, we have advised that access could be facilitated under appropriately controlled circumstances where adequate assurance of patient safety and follow-up can be provided.<\/p> <p>  Since the publication of the report, a policy decision has been made by the Minister to provide access to cannabis for medical purposes for defined medical conditions.  He has indicated his intention to proceed with the advice of the HPRA.  In conducting our review of the medical use of cannabis, the HPRA convened an expert working group comprising relevant clinical experts and patient representatives.  The working group provided valuable support and context through the sharing of insights from both patient and clinical perspectives on this issue.  The conclusions of the review are comprehensively outlined within the published report which has been circulated to the committee with my opening statement.  I would like to outline the key considerations for today's discussion.<\/p> <p>  To date, there is an absence of scientific data demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of cannabis products.  A point of importance is that there is insufficient information on the treatment of long-term medical conditions, such as those for which there is a public focus.  Most cannabis products available under international access schemes do not meet pharmaceutical quality requirements for medicines.<\/p> <p>  The review highlighted significant gaps between the public perception of effectiveness and safety, and the regulatory requirement for scientific data, which is mandatory to determine the role of cannabis as a medicine.  Any proposal to circumvent the medicines regulatory system, established by law, would require careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences and lower standards of patient protection.<\/p> <p>  The best outcome for patients is the development of authorised, or those capable of being authorised, cannabis-based medicines where the safety, effectiveness and quality can be assured, and understood by the patient and health care professionals.<\/p><p>In this way, doctors can take account of side effects and interactions with other medicines, and patients have medical oversight for their cannabis treatment.<\/p><p> If cannabis products that are not capable of being authorised as medicines, are made available through an access programme, patients and health care professionals will need to be conscious of the limitations of the programme in assuring the safety, quality and effectiveness, as compared with what would be expected for an authorised medicine.<\/p><p> Access to cannabis for medical use should recognise patient need, be evidence-based, and fit with clinical practice.  Therefore, it is advised that treatment with cannabis is only permitted under a controlled access programme for the treatment of patients with: a. spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies and interventions while under expert medical supervision; b. intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes whilst under medical supervision; and, c. severe refractory, which is treatment-resistant, epilepsy that has failed to respond to anti-convulsant medications while under medical supervision.<\/p><p> In respect of the possible use of cannabis for the three specified medical conditions, the HPRA has not only reviewed the scientific literature, but has also advised on the practical steps that could be taken to provide access for Irish patients.<\/p><p> To this end, we recommend the introduction of a monitored five-year cannabis access programme.  Such a programme is necessary both to maximise the safe and effective use of cannabis as a medical therapy for an individual patient and to minimise the potential negative impact of wider access on society. <\/p><p> It is proposed that the programme should run for a period of five years with a centralised data collection point and regular reports to the Department of Health.  This information will provide data on the medical use of cannabis and the supply needs in Ireland.  The programme will also provide an appropriate level of monitoring and accountability for the cannabis products supplied.<\/p><p> Specific elements of the access programme should include the following: Patients treated with cannabis should be under the care of a medical consultant who has expertise and experience in the treatment of the specified condition, and who is responsible for the monitoring and follow-up of the patient; authorised cannabis-based medicines should be considered for treatment in the first instance.  This includes medicines not authorised in Ireland but approved for use in other countries.  Investigational cannabis-based products subject to appropriate quality control requirements, could be sourced and used in the treatment programme when standard treatments have been unsuccessful and alternatives are not available in Ireland; doctors, pharmacists and patients should be registered under the programme, and data collected on the use of cannabis in these patients; patients should be educated on the correct use of the cannabis for medical purposes, the benefits and risks involved, how to report side-effects, and the care and safe disposal of cannabis products; and, doctors and pharmacists should be supported to facilitate prescribing and dispensing.<\/p><p> This proposal for a cannabis access programme provides a strong framework that can inform the future direction of access to cannabis for medical purposes.  Further scientific research will be key to determining that future direction.  While there is significant involvement of scientific researchers in Ireland, more clinical, human-based research is needed.  We envisage that this access programme can be adjusted and widened as clinical experience and scientific knowledge develops, and as more cannabis-based medicines become available. <\/p><p> The HPRA is committed to assisting access to cannabis for medical use, in so far as we can, within the context of our remit.  The implementation of the access programme would be a significant move for Ireland, as we align ourselves with a number of our European neighbours.  In the course of the HPRA review, 40 countries were surveyed.  In Europe, 16 countries do not have any access programmes, nine have programmes for exceptional use similar to that advised by the HPRA, and three countries have wider access programmes.<\/p><p> I have previously highlighted that the proposals in the report were accepted by the Minister, who has committed to progress the implementation as a priority.  There are a number of factors that will be required including legislation, support for patients and health care professionals, and identification of suitable quality-controlled cannabis products.<\/p><p> A new legal framework for cannabis for medical use will require time to develop, and needs to be done in a manner that is effective and best meets both patient and societal needs.  There is already provision within the existing legislation for prescribing in limited circumstances, subject to a licence from the Minister.<\/p><p>Supporting patients and health care professionals is vital to its implementation.  To that end, the HPRA understands the Department of Health will consult relevant stakeholders.  As part of its review, the HPRA has identified potential product sources and further work is under way.<\/p><p> Since publication of the report, the HPRA has met patient representatives, Deputies and their advisers and responded to queries from members of the public and the media.  We consider it important that patients and health care professionals have access to the information we can provide on medicines and the background to the HPRA&rsquo;s proposals.  In addition, we are committed to continuing to engage with the Department of Health to achieve effective and timely implementation of the proposals.<\/p><p> The HPRA advises that cannabis for medical use should only be initiated as part of a structured process of formal ongoing clinical evaluation of patients with clearly defined medical conditions.  This position is based on current scientific evidence and will be kept under review.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for giving us this opportunity to make a presentation to the committee.  We will be happy to address follow-up questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorraine Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":948,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Nolan.

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Marie Egan, a pharmacist in the medicines and controlled drugs unit; Dr. John Devlin, deputy chief medical officer; and Dr. Ronan Glynn, specialist registrar in public health medicine.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee will know that cannabis is a Schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act and the most widely used illegal drug in Ireland.  It is worth remembering that it is not currently an authorised medicine and has not gone through the normal regulatory procedures for medicines which are designed to protect patients and ensure treatments are supported by good evidence of their effectiveness and safety.  However, the Department is aware that some patients believe cannabis should be a treatment option for their medical condition.  It is also aware that a number of countries have changed the law or introduced programmes to allow access, under strict conditions, for certain groups of patients.<\/p> <p>  Against this background, on 3 November 2016 the Minister for Health announced a review of policy on cannabis for medical use.  He requested the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, to provide him with expert advice.  On 10 February he published the HPRA&rsquo;s report, Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review, and announced that he would establish an access programme for standardised cannabis-based treatments for the following conditions: spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, resistant to all standard therapies and interventions; intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes; and severe, refractory treatment resistant epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anticonvulsant medications.  The Minister has thanked the HPRA and the members of the expert review group for their work on the report which he has described as a milestone in the development of policy on medicinal cannabis.<\/p> <p>  Patients accessing cannabis under the programme will be required to be under the care of a medical consultant.  Officials will consult stakeholders on how the access programme will operate.  It will be important to engage with the clinical community in the development of a framework to operationalise the access programme for the implementation of medicinal cannabis in health care.  Officials are also examining legislative changes that will be required to underpin the access programme.<\/p> <p>  The Minister intends to progress the establishment of the access programme as a priority.  However, to be clear, patients accessing cannabis under the cannabis access programme will need to be recommended for cannabis treatment by a relevant medical consultant involved in their care.  This recognises the relevance of such treatment in the overall care planning and management of the underlying medical condition.<\/p> <p>  For the period during which the access programme is being established, it remains open to the Minister to grant a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Act for access to cannabis for medical purposes in individual cases.  Such applications will be considered on a case by case basis.  The granting of a licence must, however, be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for giving us the opportunity to make a presentation to the committee.

I would welcome some information on that.  It happens regularly enough that a doctor prescribes an unlicensed medicine in this country.  In my job I am aware that unlicensed medicines, usually ones which are licensed in other countries, are prescribed.  There is no reason they are not licensed here but it is more an issue concerning paperwork.  One could ask what that would leave us open to in this country if we were to circumvent the licensing.  In other countries are such products always made available on foot of a consultant's prescription?  If a consultant or regular GP prescribes a product off-licence, where does the liability lie?  My understanding is that if a doctor prescribes something in Ireland off-licence, he or she is solely liable for the effects of the medicines, and takes it upon himself or herself professionally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#E00500","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":953,"content":"<p>The HPRA is now saying that we should look at establishing an access programme for three specified medical conditions.  An outline was given of what the potential access programme could look like.  It was said that the programme would be monitored, that it would be for five years and that there would be a centralised data collection point.  It was also said that a new legal framework would be needed in order to establish the access programme.  On page 32 of the report there is reference to the 1961 UN convention on narcotic drugs, to which Ireland is a party.  It says that under the convention the production and distribution of controlled substances must be licensed and supervised and the rationale for that is outlined.  In terms of the legal framework, do the witnesses from the HPRA expect the changes will have to be made in primary legislation or if they can be made in secondary legislation?  Did they make any recommendations to the Minister or was that left to the Department?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses from the Department stated that the Minister has accepted the establishment of a new access programme and that it will take time to implement.  We heard that the Department is looking at options in terms of legislation.  Will the legislative changes be made in primary legislation or by means of statutory instrument?  It was also outlined that in the absence of an access programme it remains open to the Minister to grant a licence under certain circumstances.  Could the witnesses outline what those circumstances are because there seems to be much confusion in terms of how someone can get a licence from the Minister before the access programme is established?

There is a lot of emotive debate around this topic.  A woman from Cork is coming to the D&aacute;il today, and it is important that we acknowledge the work and effort she has put into campaigning on this particular issue.  However, just because people are campaigning does not mean that what is being sought can be provided by political decisions.<\/p> <p>  We are discussing the health implications of individuals and, more broadly, society in the context of making cannabinoid oils with THC available through an access programme at some stage.  That will require a lot of monitoring, evaluation and correlation of medical and scientific data over the next number of years.<\/p> <p>  In the context of what is being discussed, and given the backdrop of Vera Twomey arriving in the D&aacute;il in the next hour or so, there has been a lot of confusion about the use of cannabinoid oils with THC.  Parliamentary questions were been tabled and there was a perception that a registered doctor could prescribe oils with THC in them.  Reference has been made to a number of parliamentary questions asked last October, replies to which stated an application could be made for a licence if a registered doctor made an application.  However, it was not made clear that a consultant paediatric neurologist had to make such applications.<\/p> <p>  I can understand the need to ensure there is proper scrutiny in the prescribing of drugs.  There should also be proper scrutiny of D&aacute;il questions and replies to ensure that they are accurate and do not mislead people, in particular in sensitive matters.  For a long period of time, the parliamentary questions gave a family hope they could access something they believed could change the life of their daughter but were subsequently refused on the grounds that a paediatric neurologist was not prescribing the drug.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the access programme.  How far has the European Medicines Agency gone in terms of examining the issue?  What other countries are making cannabinoid oils with THC available to patients under various licensing systems?  Are some countries more proactive than others?  Is there a lot of resistance in other countries?  I ask the witnesses to expand on the international comparators, primarily within the European Union, North America and Australia.  Did the witnesses consider that when compiling the report, for which I compliment them on bringing forward expeditiously?  It highlights issues such as spasticity, nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and epilepsy.  Why were those three areas highlighted in the report?  Was it because there is a body of research available or are the witnesses saying that other medicines may not work?  Are they suggesting that because they do not work something else should be tried?  Is there a strong body of international evidence to show that there is an improvement in outcomes in the three areas mentioned?<\/p> <p>  How many people have applied for licences in Ireland?  Without breaching confidentiality rules, how were such drugs prescribed?  Did consultants, GPs or other individuals prescribe cannabinoid oil with THC?  At what level were the clinicians who prescribed such drugs? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#G00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":956,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Deputy Kelleher.

She asked whether a medical consultant was required in the context of the access scheme we are proposing.  One of the conditions we have set out is that the patient should be under the supervision of a specialist medical consultant.  The conditions for treatment would include severe epilepsy, cancer and multiple sclerosis.  All patients treated in those cases would be under the care of a specialist consultant.  They would also be under the control of a general practitioner &ndash; I wish to make that point straight and upfront.<\/p> <p>  The reason we have outlined the need for specialist medical consultant oversight relates to the fact that one of the requirements of the access programme is to ensure that all the conventional forms for treatment have been tried.  There is a view that specialist knowledge is required to ascertain whether that is the case.  We are taking about cannabis being used in addition to an established treatment programme for a patient.  Specialist medical oversight is important to monitor the effects of cannabis on the patient and how the effects might interact with the current medical regime of the patient.  We really believe this approach will bring about the best outcome for patients and that is what we have recommended.  In other words, the patient needs to be under the supervision of a medical consultant as well.  We have not necessarily said that the consultant has to prescribe.  It is a question of monitoring the effects of cannabis on the patient in view of the complexity of the issues that I have outlined.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to medical prescriptions in other countries.  There are several variations in the approaches taken in other countries.  It is generally the case that the medical prescriber is required to be a specialist and have specific training.  That is generally the case throughout the European system and also in the international context.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the access programme and whether cannabis would be authorised.  We need to be clear that this is not an authorisation of cannabis as a medicine that we would conventionally view as being an authorisation of a medicine, because the data is simply not available and we have no submission to work on.  Cannabis would not be authorised as a medicine in the sense that we would see a medicine as being authorised in this regard.<\/p> <p>  If I recall it correctly, another question related to off-label use of medicines.  It is certainly possible for a doctor to prescribe a medicine off-label.  That could include an authorised cannabis medicine for treatment of another condition.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Brien asked about our views on the legislation that would be required to implement the access programme and the role of the International Narcotics Control Board.  I wish to be clear at the outset that the role of the International Narcotics Control Board is a supervisory and monitoring role.  The fundamental purpose of the board is to ensure that for whatever purpose a country permits consumption of a controlled substance, including cannabis, all the elements of consumption, including the manufacturing process and consumption by patients, are appropriately monitored and that monitoring can prevent diversion.  It is usually the case that we have to declare medical needs and consumption to the International Narcotics Control Board.  The board then gives us what is known as a quota or estimate system to which we must adhere in terms of the consumption requirements of the controlled substance.  We need to know the medical uses in terms of adhering to the system of monitoring provided and set out.<\/p> <p>  I was asked specifically for the view of the Health Products Regulatory Authority on legislation and I am willing to answer that point.  Committee members are aware that the progression of legislation is under the remit of the Department of Health.  I imagine officials from the Department will give their views to the committee as well.  Our report has indicated that primary legislation may be required.  Again, it is for the Department to determine whether primary legislation is required to implement these measures, whether secondary legislation is a more appropriate route or whether it can be managed under existing provisions.<\/p><p>That is our statement on the matter.<\/p><p> Deputy Kelleher asked about the position in Europe, in particular the position of the European Medicines Agency, EMA, on the use of medicinal cannabis.  I need to be very clear that the EMA has had no position on medicinal use of cannabis and, simply put, in terms of the current data, the EMA would not be endorsing the medicinal use of cannabis in any way.  The requirements are not there to authorise this as a conventional medicine, which is the business and role of the EMA, and the medicinal use of cannabis simply would not meet the requirements.  Throughout Europe nine countries currently have an access programme that is similar to what we are proposing, which is that it would be available in exceptional circumstances for the treatment of patients who are under specialist medical control and that it would be an exceptional rather than a conventional and widespread use.  Three countries have a wider access programme than we are proposing.  These include The Netherlands, which has a well established programme, Italy and the Czech Republic.  These countries have more widespread prescribing for a range of conditions.  The methodologies these countries use to secure the cannabis-based products that they are using, which are pharmaceutically controlled materials, are also different.  For example, The Netherlands would grow its own cannabis.  A contract is issued by the State to a company to generate the stocks of the cannabis and procure them and then these stocks are supplied to pharmacies that dispense them for patient use.  Sixteen countries have a prohibitive system that would be similar to the current system in Ireland.<\/p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. Elaine Breslin, who will speak about the conditions that were selected and the rationale and basis to the selections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorraine Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":959,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelleher for his question.  He asked about the three conditions that we have selected.  We carried out a scientific review of the evidence for the three conditions, namely, spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and intractable severe treatment resistant epilepsy.  The evidence is modest across all of the conditions.  In our review of cannabis, in general we found that the evidence is poor and often conflicting for all of the indications.  When we say conflicting, we mean that different reviewers consider the information to be different.  For example, in the case of pain, one reviewer considered the evidence to be moderate while another stated that it is substantial, although the same data set was used.  It is, therefore, difficult to reconcile those positions when trying to make a recommendation.<\/p> <p>  We have recommended that cannabis could be considered for the three conditions.  We are not recommending treatment with cannabis because there are only three authorised medicines available.  If patients were to have exhausted all available treatments and the feeling was that cannabis could be effective for a particular patient, cannabis treatment could be considered for those particular conditions.  Authorised medicines are available for two of the three conditions and for one of the conditions, which is epilepsy, a cannabidiol oil is currently under development.  Deputy Kelleher asked about the European Medicines Agency.  The medicine has been accepted as an orphan medicine for the conditions of Dravet and Lennox Gastaut because it is recognised that there is an unmet need.

That medicine is currently under development and is going through clinical trials.  One paper has been published that gives evidence of some efficacy across a group of epilepsy disorders and other trials are currently under evaluation by the company, which has issued press statements, but we cannot draw any conclusions on the basis of that.  The committee will understand that the normal process is for the papers to be published in peer reviewed journals and the medical community will discuss the evidence that is available.  We understand, however, that the company developing the medicine is planning to make an application in Europe and the US later this year.<\/p><p> The conditions we have chosen have objective end-points that can be measured by consultants monitoring a patient.  Reductions in spasticity and the number of seizures as well as the control of the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy can be assessed.  These are, therefore, objective end-points.  One of the problems one sees with the studies is that cannabis is found to be effective on subjective end-points or patient related effects, whereas when a consultant or doctor treating the patient examines the objective end-points, he or she finds that the efficacy and effectiveness are not necessarily shown.  There are objective end-points for the three conditions.  This is terribly important because this is a monitored pilot programme which will be available to a limited number of patients with the specified conditions under consultant care.  It is important that at the end of the five-year pilot programme, data will be available to show how the cannabis was used for the conditions in question and whether it worked for the individual patients.  This is not the type of data that would be suitable for publication in the sense of allowing others to draw conclusions.  However, it will inform the future direction of cannabis use in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":963,"content":"<p>Why does the Health Products Regulatory Authority have a preference for primary legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#K00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":964,"content":"<p>One of the reasons we suggested primary legislation is that the misuse of drugs legislation, on which I am focusing, currently treats cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug.  It is usually the case that if a substance or drug is to be used medically, it is rescheduled into Schedule 2.  This has been the case, for example, for Salivex, which is an authorised cannabis based medicine.  In the case of Salivex, the confidence in terms of rescheduling it was largely generated by the fact that it was authorised as a medicine.  On the basis of this authorisation, which means it met the full data requirements in terms of quality, safety and efficacy, it was moved into Schedule 2.  There was full confidence in allowing all prescribers to prescribe the drug in line with the conditions that it set out for treating it.<\/p> <p>  The issue here is that we are not proposing a rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2 because we have not reached the point, except in the case of the three products Dr. Breslin mentioned, where they meet the requirements for authorisation of a medicine.  That type of rescheduling is not appropriate in this case.  The reason we suggested primary legislation would be necessary is that one needs to enable some form of prescribing provision for this because the access system currently operates under a licence granted by the Minister.  This places the Minister very much at the heart of the clinical decision making process, which is not appropriate in the context of an access programme that we decide.  Clinicians need to be allowed to use their clinical judgment.  This limited provision allowing a Schedule 1 drug to be prescribed fundamentally changes the construct of the misuse of drugs legislation.  For this reason, we consider that primary legislation would be required.

There have only been two licence applications.  They are both from GPs.  In terms of who makes the licence application, there is obviously an applicant, but the applicant may include supporting documentation or information from others involved in the case.  In a number of parliamentary questions, the Minister has set out what one might generally expect to see in an application for a licence.

I refer members to the statement from the chief medical officer yesterday.  He said that an appropriate application, endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time, has to be submitted to the Department of Health.  A consultant does not have to personally apply in each case, but certainly the consultant should endorse the course of treatment that is proposed and be able to take responsibility for the overall treatment of that patient.

Is it the parent, the GP or the medical consultant?  Who is accountable for issuing and monitoring a licence?  It has been mentioned that medical consultants monitor the licence.  Do medical consultants report on the matter?  This aspect has been discussed but it needs to be clarified.  What does one do with a parent who finds it difficult to get his or her medical adviser to come on board?

Dr. Nolan mentioned that the Netherlands, Italy and the Czech Republic have all followed an approached access to medicinal cannabis.  It is more extensive than the programme proposed by the HPRA and is in line with the proposals for access contained in Deputy Gino Kenny's Bill.  The HPRA has chosen a more conservative approach than the one adopted by the Netherlands, Italy and the Czech Republic.<\/p><p>That happily dovetails with the Government's desire to kill Deputy Gino Kenny's Bill and only allow access in the cases that it decides.  Why?  What is wrong with the approach adopted in the Netherlands, Italy and the Czech Republic?  Why did the HPRA make a recommendation in line with opinion No. 14 instead of something that was in line with what had been adopted in those countries?  Has it any evidence to suggest there was anything irresponsible in the way the Dutch, the Italians or the Czechs had done things?  I suggest it does not.  Is the HPRA even qualified to adjudicate on this matter?  The delegates made the point that Ireland did not have experience.  Countries such as the Netherlands, Italy, the Czech Republic, Canada and so on do.  They have set up cannabis regulatory authorities similar to the one included in Deputy Gino Kenny's proposal and are developing specific expertise.  Those regimes make a distinction between cannabis and other pharmaceutical-type drugs.  It was a political decision.<\/p><p> At the very least, we need to debate which is the better option and hear arguments on both sides instead of just one view.  Other countries which are just as responsible as this one and which have more experience of this issue have made different decisions.  Will the delegates respond to these points?<\/p><p> Why has the question of pain relief been omitted?  Of the 800,000 people who suffer from chronic pain, 40% report that none of the medications they have tried addresses their condition.  They include cancer sufferers who have been left out in the cold in this regard.  Only those who suffer from nausea related to chemotherapy will be allowed into the trial programme.  Why are the 800,000 people mentioned being left out in the cold?  How can that be justified?  It is not only me who is asking the question.  I ask the delegates to respond to David Finn, professor of pharmacology and therapeutics at the Centre for Pain Research in NUI Galway, who is undertaking research in this area.  According to him, it is disappointing that the report does not include a reference to chronic pain because a significant number of patients who suffer from chronic pain could be denied the opportunity to trial cannabis or cannabinoids as a consequence unless the case for their use to treat chronic pain can be strongly argued with the Government such that they will be included in the final legislation.  He points out that one in five people suffers from chronic pain, or approximately 800,000 in Ireland alone, which is of an epidemic scale and all the more reason to do what we can to introduce new treatments that could benefit them, especially when we consider that 40% currently report that their medications are inadequate.  In addition, he believes the concerns about misuse and diversion in the wider community are not unique to the use of cannabis and cannabinoids, as they also apply to opiates which have been the mainstay in pain treatment for decades.  According to him, cannabis has significantly less potential for abuse than opiates and any concern could be mitigated to a large degree were the legislation to allow consultants to prescribe cannabis medicines for the treatment of chronic pain.  Ms Vera Twomey was mentioned.  She has said this, as has Professor Michael Barnes.  I spoke to Ms Twomey in great detail in recent days.  She will not mind me saying she is the person who has been denied medicinal cannabis.  She believes we are taking too conservative an approach, which is why she has been denied access to it.  She does not believe others who are suffering should be denied access to it in whatever approach we take.<\/p><p> On the legislative issue, my heart was sinking while the delegates discussed the time that would be required.<\/p><p>I do not understand this.  We have a Bill before us, Second Stage of which was passed by the D&aacute;il before Christmas, which acknowledges the need for much more research in this area, states we have to have a regulatory authority, states medicinal cannabis should be accessed through a doctor's prescription and attempts to deal with the removal of cannabis from schedule 1, which is an obstacle as has been alluded to.  Why would it take six months, a year or even two years, rather than dealing with the legislation before us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#N00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":987,"content":"<p>Originally we understood the Private Members' Bill would be dealt with by the committee in April and we were not prepared to go into it in any detail today.

Its membership will be broad-based with all the relevant medical specialties, including oncology, palliative care, neurology, psychiatry, anaesthesia, which includes pain management, general practice, pharmacy, the HPRA, patient representatives and ourselves.  The focus of the group is to provide an operational framework as to how a scheme will work into the future.  It needs to answer clear questions, for example, the clinical criteria for patient access for medicinal purposes, the forms of cannabis that can be used, the roles and responsibilities of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health care professionals who may be involved in the dispensing of cannabis for medical purposes, the requirements for a registry through which the scheme can be monitored and the mechanisms through which further scientific developments in the area can be monitored over time.  This work has started and we anticipate that the first meeting of the group will take place in the coming weeks while we expect a report to be made available within four months.

This is an important area because in many of the countries we have referred to where there are broader access programmes - the Netherlands, Czech Republic and Italy - cannabis is not considered a medicine and, therefore, its side effects are not collected in the same way we collect side effects for conventional medicines.  Part of our role is to collect the side effects.  That is quite different and, in many cases, the establishment of those broader programmes is outside the remit of the regulatory authorities such as ourselves; they are based in the Ministry of health.<\/p><p>The perception of cannabis is quite different.  It is not seen as a medicine but as something else.  Formal data are therefore not collected.<\/p><p> We have data on use in recreational circumstances.  There are many pieces of literature about that.  The safety in short-term use is quite well known.  The side-effects associated with short-term use of cannabis include euphoria, hallucinations, anxiety, paranoia, psychosis, impaired short term memory and confusion, impaired motor co-ordination, altered judgement and increased risky behaviour.  There are some gastro-intestinal side-effects such as diarrhoea.  The effects of long-term use, either recreational or heavy use, are of interest.  We are aware that there is addiction in 9% of cases.  The addiction rate rises to approximately 17% if one begins to use cannabis in adolescence.  If one uses it regularly or is a heavy user, the addiction rate rises to about 50%.  There is an increased risk of chronic psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, particularly in adolescence and in people who are at risk because of a strong family history of psychosis.  We do not know that cannabis causes psychosis.  The literature is not saying that, but it says clearly that cannabis is a preventable risk factor for psychosis.  It is a particular risk for young people who have a family history of psychosis and who use cannabis that is associated with a higher level of tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, which is the psychotogenic component of cannabis.<\/p><p> Another risk associated with long term use is cognitive impairment.  This is important if it is used in young people in adolescence.  There is a potential for cannabis to affect neuro-development and cause neuro-developmental delay.  We see cognitive impairment in older people, with lower intelligence quotient, IQ, among those who are frequent users during adolescence.  I have referred to altered brain development.  It is also associated with poor educational outcomes, increased likelihood of dropping out of schools, a diminished life satisfaction with achievement and what is referred to as the amotivational syndrome.  It is also associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation and attempts and with the symptoms of chronic bronchitis.  All of those side effects are really associated with recreational use.  We do not have good data on the medical use of cannabis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":1001,"content":"<p>To support comments made by Dr. Devlin in response to Senator Burke, an issue associated with this access programme will be the system of implementation and the supports put in place for implementation.

Why has pain been left out?  Can Dr. Nolan respond to the points made by Professor Finn that I read to her?  I want to stress this, particularly after Dr. Breslin's intervention.  Professor Finn said that the long list of adverse side effects of recreational cannabis use have very little to do with what we are discussing here, which is about medicinal use.  Is it not the case, as alluded to by Professor Finn, that we have a whole range of authorised drugs at the moment where the adverse side effects - there is strong evidence of this - are as bad as, or in many cases much worse than, any evidence we have for adverse effects from medicinal cannabis?<\/p> <p>  OxyContin opiate, known as hillbilly heroin, is widely prescribed as an end-of-the-line painkiller.  It is authorised and is highly addictive.  Benzedrine and Prozac are highly addictive and there is much evidence of adverse effects.  Their efficacy is questionable and it is certainly a debatable issue, but they are authorised.  There is a much lower bar for how they can be prescribed and who can prescribe them.  A general practitioner can prescribe those things, so why and on what basis have we decided that only a consultant can prescribe cannabis for medicinal use?  A GP is a registered specialist so why can a GP not prescribe cannabis?  None of these things is being explained.<\/p> <p>  A view is being put here but we are not hearing the counter view.  We need to hear the counter view as expressed by Professor Finn, Professor Barnes and many other eminent people.  No doubt people from the Netherlands, Italy and the Czech Republic would come in here and give a pretty different perspective on all this.  That needs to be acknowledged in any debate.  That is not to say who is right or wrong.  People have their opinions but what we are getting here are opinions, not definitive positions.  Nobody can claim to have the absolutely correct position because there are diverse opinions across the medical area and in how states deal with this by way of legislation or regulation.

The Deputy asked why we would choose to align ourselves with those nine countries that have a restrictive access programme versus those three countries in Europe that have a wider access programme.  We need to be clear that we have not aligned ourselves with any particular country or position taken by a European country with regard to this.  What we have done is review the available scientific evidence on this issue.  We have also reviewed the position in other countries but what we have ended up with, in terms of the proposals for the access programme, is based upon a review of the available science.  However, it is also taking into account the Irish context, the Irish health care system and the view of those clinicians who are practising within the Irish health care system because whatever comes from this has to be implementable in the Irish context.  That is an important point to make at the outset.<\/p> <p>  The position, and it is not a question of alignment, is that none of those three countries in Europe changed to a very wide access programme in one move.  No country has moved from a position where it had very strong prohibition to a position where it has a wide programme of access in one change.  Those three countries have all moved through this process of having a restricted form of access programme in which they can gather and generate information on their needs.  They know their needs and requirements before they move to a wider access programme and they also know, coming back to the International Narcotics Control Board, INCB, issue I spoke of earlier, their consumption needs in that context, which is an important point in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned pain.  I want to say at the outset that in the course of conducting our review we had a number of discussions with Professor David Finn.  He has contacted us since the Irish Pain Society's statement has come out and we are in the process of discussing it with him.<\/p> <p>  With regard to pain, the Deputy is right.  One in five or 800,000 people suffers from chronic pain, so we acknowledge the number of people who are impacted by pain.  In that context, we can understand that people suffering from pain are looking for alternative approaches to treatment.  However, when we reviewed the data on that, and the Deputy mentioned the Barnes review, including the Corcoran review, the national academy's report and those of the Journal of the American Medical Association and others, we saw that they all look at pain.  Twenty-eight pain studies have been conducted in this area and when we look at those pain studies we see that pain is a symptom associated with many conditions.  It is not ring-fenced in the way epilepsy or spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis can be.  It is an outcome of very many diseases and conditions.  Those studies are looking at pain across a variety of contexts.  They are also looking at a wide range of products including some of the medicines that are authorised that we spoke about such as Nabilone and Dronabinol.  The nabiximols, which would be Satifex, would be one of those also.  They are also looking at cannabis, which is smoked and inhaled.  We are looking at no standardisation in terms of the type and the form of the product used or investigated in those pain trials and no standardisation of the conditions.  It is incredibly difficult, therefore, to draw objective evidence from that.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to objective evidence, the outcomes for patients in those trials is very different when we look at the detail, depending on whether it is the doctor who is reporting on those outcomes versus the patient.  That is because pain is subjective.  If I experience pain I may say mine is ten on a scale of one to ten whereas the Deputy's might be five.  That is very much down to the individual.  That is the problem in looking at all of those pain studies.  All of the reviews we have looked at clearly cite the need for more research in pain.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the context of other alternatives in addition to opiates.

The problem is the risks have not been appropriately qualified.  If one wants to have a system under which one potentially expose 800,000 people to risks, that is a huge jump in moving forward.  What we are saying is that in order to ensure the correct levels of patient protection it is more important to look at the issue in a different way.  We are certainly not closing the door on use for pain relief.  We are simply saying the evidence is currently not strong enough to move forward because their use cannot be ring-fenced in the way that it can be for other patients.<\/p> <p>  I would like to come back to the point Dr. Elaine Breslin made about end points, namely, that for all of the conditions chosen under the access programme there are measurable end points that can be determined.  A doctor can look at how a patient's spasticity is responding to the treatment and make a decision on whether the treatment is working and if it is not, it is not acceptable or appropriate to expose him or her to an unqualified risk.  It is the same issue in the treatment of nausea associated with chemotherapy.  It is obvious whether the use of cannabis is working in the treatment.  Similarly, in the treatment of epilepsy.  There are measurable end points, but there are no end points in the treatment of pain which fundamentally is one of the problems.<\/p> <p>  The point on opiates to which I would like to come back concerns the idea of whether they provide a less addictive alternative.  I am not saying it does not have validity, but it simply has not been studied.  Nobody has looked at the effects in switching patients from opiates to cannabis and determined whether it is less addictive.  Nobody knows what dose of cannabis one could try for a patient.  The evidence is simply not available.  It needs to be studied and the evidence brought forward.  The access programme can give a lot more information and confidence in how the system could be worked.  Nobody is saying clinical research should not be encouraged alongside it.  In this country, much of it due to Professor David Finn's efforts, a huge range of preclinical research has been conducted.  We really need to harness, work with and back it from a policy perspective and carry out more properly conducted trials on pain subjects.  Including within the programme pain patients will not generate data in the way needed to bring them forward because it is not a formal clinical trial programme.  That is an important distinction in this respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#U00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorraine Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>Professor David Finn does not agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#U00800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>As I mentioned, what we are trying to do in this group is bring the clinical community with us.<\/p><p>We have national standards for clinical development, under the ages of the national clinical effectiveness committee.

I agree entirely with the levels of pain being determined by the individual rather than in some general application of rules.

It is unfair to try to bring them into this debate because we are talking about two completely different scenarios.  For example, Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to some prescribed medicines, for example, Prozac.  If a person was to take the drug in an unsupervised setting the side effects could be considerably more harmful than if it were prescribed while being monitored by a doctor.  We cannot compare like with like in that regard and I do not believe we should be muddying the waters on the issue.  Anyone who has ever seen someone who is addicted to Prozac will know that it is completely different from someone who is taking Prozac for a short period.<\/p><p> We have now established that we are looking at a minimum of six months for legislation with the possibility of 18 months.  The only option available at the moment is the licensing arrangement.  The Chairman has asked for clarification and it is important we get it.

However, the consultant need not prescribe it himself or herself; a doctor can prescribe it.  Can the witnesses clarify this point?<\/p><p> The Chairman made another point relating to a consultant.  If a consultant gets a licence, is it universal to other individuals or must it apply on a case-by-case basis?<\/p><p> My final point relates to costs.  If we are considering whether to bring forward legislation for people to access cannabis-based medicines, then obviously a cost arises.  In the normal way of things, drugs are reimbursed through public health schemes provided it is an authorised medicine.  That is my understanding.  In this case, we have cannabis for medicinal purposes.  While a trial period is under way, it is not going to be recognised as a medicine.  Does this have implications for reimbursement costs?  Have we examined that?  If we are looking to provide a scheme for the coming five years, then will some reimbursement programme be put in place?  Is that even possible without it being classified as a medicine?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#V00400","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":1023,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy O'Brien.

I apologise if I am repeating points that have been dealt with in my absence.<\/p> <p>  I wish to clarify the answer given by Dr. Nolan before I left.  Dr. Nolan said that the patient who claims to require this medication must be under the supervision of a consultant but that, in theory, the prescription could be written by a registered medical practitioner.  This applies only under three specified conditions, namely, resistant epilepsy, nausea to do with cancer treatment and multiple sclerosis.<\/p> <p>  One requirement to access the programme is that those involved have exhausted or used all other forms of medication.  Perhaps the pharmacist, Ms Maria Egan or whoever is most suitable could outline the answer.  There are examples of interactions that arise between medications and common foods, such as the interaction of certain medications with grapefruit.  Often people do not identify the interaction between warfarin and spinach.  Interactions with medicines are not simple.  Obviously, there are the effects of medicines on other medicines but other issues can emerge through the use of certain medicines.  This is not straightforward.  If something has not been trialled correctly and is mixed in with other mediations or foods, then the data are not available.  People can actually die from the use of some over-the-counter products with warfarin.  I say as much simply as an example to show that it is not as clear-cut as ticking a box.<\/p><p>As I was leaving, it was stated that the European Medicines Agency has no position on this and does not endorse CBD as the evidence is not suitable.  Is that correct?  Have I understood that correctly?<\/p><p> As a pharmacist and on Deputy O'Brien's point on side effects of Prozac, having a prescription does not change the side effect profile of something.  It does not really matter if one is taking Prozac or anything else with a prescription; the side effects will be the same.  It just means that someone is responsible and the person is part of a care pathway.<\/p><p> On reimbursement costs, many unlicensed medicines are reimbursed.  They get special reimbursement.  My concern is that Holland, whose pharmacy system I am quite familiar with, has specific pharmaceutical grade product with specific concentrations that are used.  Perhaps I am not understanding it, but will the witnesses elaborate on what exactly we are saying is okay in these three conditions?  Is it an arbitrary concentration of a product or an arbitrary derivative?  Are we looking at a specific breed of plant, extract or concentration?  What do we have when it comes to dosage and indication?  I know the evidence is poor, but have we any dosing parameters to work with?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#W00300","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the lengthy briefing.  I hope there is agreement on it but, as we are concluding, it would be helpful to clarify or acknowledge that the job of the HPRA is, as I understand it, to work within certain EU directives and frameworks to approve a drug to be used an dispensed.  As I understand it, it is not about deciding the efficacy of a particular product for a particular patient.  I think that is an important distinction and perhaps those from the HPRA or others might want to confirm it.  Notwithstanding the clear differences of opinion, I also hope it is acknowledged that other choices have been made and that other opinions exist.  These include those of medical professionals as well as regulatory authorities and Legislatures in other States.  There is no particular reason to believe that whatever recommendations or opinions are adopted here are superior to the opinions or decisions that have been made by other States.

One can probably say from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, report and the Minister's acceptance of that report, there is a clear political direction - the Government has decided this is the way it is going and has set out the three conditions under which the access programme will be available.  If one is a consultant working in those areas, one will know the Government has made a policy decision in that direction.<\/p> <p>  The issue of liability has not been raised directly with us.  Consultants who work in the public system are in the clinical indemnity scheme and sometimes they prescribe products that are not authorised, but their employers are aware of the treatment that is proposed and have approved it.  Consultants cannot decide to prescribe, but if the authorities are aware that one is trying a product, for which one has a licence from the Minister, that is a different scenario.  <\/p> <p>  Those issues can be explored further.  I am not sure that is the absolute barrier in the case of a consultant working in a public hospital.  My belief is that in some cases, the fact that they are not dealing with an authorised medicine, the evidence may not be sufficient for some consultants at this stage to use such a medicine.  Possibly the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, report and the work of the group that Dr. Devlin has referred to may provide further confidence in these medicines.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Devlin may elaborate further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Lennon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>If a doctor or a consultant is unable to provide a treatment for whatever reason, the Medical Council is very clear that the doctor must co-operate with whoever provides it, to include transfer of notes.  That depends on the interaction between the patient and the doctor.  The doctor is then obliged to go along with that.  The possibility is there for a second opinion.<\/p> <p>  The other issue that has been raised is the role of doctors and consultants, as two separate entities.  Of course it is not like that in practice.  Whether it is this or any other aspect of clinical care, most care is provided on a shared care basis, so the doctor is working together with the GPs.  Shared care means that the roles and responsibilities for consultants and GPs are clearly identified so the GP knows what he or she is doing and the consultant knows what he or she is doing.  The difference between consultants who work in acute hospitals and general practice is just in respect of their training programmes.  Consultants have great expertise and training in specific disease clinical areas and have developed a competence and expertise which may give them greater knowledge in relation to particular issues, whether it be neurosurgery, and so on.  General practitioners on the other hand are generalists.  When it comes to dealing with complex drug interactions, it is quite relevant and clinically appropriate that one would have the advice of the consultant available who would have an understanding of the condition, which may be a rare condition, which the GP may or may not have and be able to manage that.  In other words that is a clinically appropriate way of dealing with a very complex case.  Certain patients may often be on multiple medications.  The consultant, by virtue of the training and expertise has a good understanding of those interactions, hence it is reasonably appropriate that there is consultant supervision in terms of what is now essentially a new treatment being proffered.<\/p> <p>  There needs to be an education on this and that is part of the work of this group.  When the procedures, operating clinical protocols and everything else are put in place these are communicated to the relevant specialties including general practice and will be part of the training on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Devlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":1060,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Devlin.

I am concerned at the direction we are taking on this issue.<\/p><p>Consultants have a level of competence and experience that has been developed over many years in a particular area, which is exactly what Dr. Devlin has said.  Where are we going if we circumvent the clear advice and research of the Health Products Regulatory Authority?  The HPRA is not a mean organisation that wants to stop people getting medication, rather it safeguards the health of the nation regarding medicines.  <\/p><p> When thalidomide was first launched a good few years ago, it was deemed a wonder drug that would relieve morning sickness.  As it turned out, the trial data for the medication did not exist but I will not bore the committee with the details.  Anybody who suffers hyperemesis will happily take whatever one is handed.  Let us say the trial data did not exist but we had a person or two in Ireland who suffered severe hyperemesis as a result of pregnancy.  Theoretically, we could have a case where somebody who is suffering from severe morning sickness could approach the Minister and say, \"I want this drug prescribed\".  If we go ahead with the proposal for the State to indemnify consultants and children are born without limbs, the onus will be on the State.  <\/p><p> As the committee will know, I am familiar with the framework which was not developed to be mean to people or to avoid giving people things.  It exists to safeguard the health of the people of this country.  To my mind, it is a very robust system.  I have never had a difficulty with it.  As a pharmacist, I am quite uncomfortable with the three conditions that have been recommended.  I am fine with the framework and can see where it comes from, but what about the sanctity of the doctor's position, be it a GP or a consultant?<\/p><p> It is a bad state of affairs when the State starts telling medical professionals what they should do and that it will provide insurance if a person's arm falls off or whatever.  What are we at here?  We have good systems in place, yet we are trying to get around them.  What happens if a child or an adult suffers from an overdose of CBD or whatever product he or she is taking in the next few weeks?  We must be conscious that such a scenario could happen.  His or her blood would be on our hands to some extent.<\/p><p> We must be careful.  I support the initiative once a process has been gone through.  I am not a party pooper.  I want everyone to get what they can get if it is right for them to get it and it will improve their lives, but let us not rip up the rule book.  Medication can cause terrible unintended consequences.  We could spend all night talking about this matter.  The witnesses know, some committee members know and I know that terrible side effects have been caused by medications that were never anticipated.  That is why we have robust trials and assessment of medicines.  Everyone thought thalidomide was great until the second isomer emerged.

From our review, we know that a number of products could be supplied using this route.  Some are effectively cannabis flowering tip itself, where the cannabis plant is grown in carefully controlled conditions that comply with the European good manufacturing practice, GMP, requirements.  While a product would not necessarily meet the full standard requirement for authorisation of a medicine, we have a reassurance of the quality of the product.  This relates to the content of the cannabinoids in it, namely, the CBD and THC content.  Knowing the products' content will provide a basis for working out a dosing regime.  This might answer the Deputies' questions.<\/p> <p>  There is also the potential for a number of processed oils that are extracted from the plant and contain cannabinoids to be sourced.  Some of the companies that manufacture these products are interested in considering these and putting them through clinical trial programmes so that they may become authorised as medicines.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Boyd Barrett's question on opinions on this matter, we are a medicines regulatory authority.  Our job is to ensure that the medicines that are available in our market are safe, appropriate and work for patients.  Our fundamental reason for being is the protection of public health.  It is difficult to have any discussion on cannabis for medicinal use without the question of it being a medicine on the table.  This is about the best outcome for a patient.  The medicines system and framework exist in Europe in order to protect public health.  For example, Deputy O'Connell mentioned the thalidomide disaster.  Everything we do is founded on that principle.  Were I, as chief executive of our authority, asked to put any other substance on the market for access to a wide group of patients when I could not say whether it worked or was fully safe, committee members would ask me why I did that and why I was negligent.<\/p> <p>  Other countries that have examined this topic outside of a medicines programme ended up with two parallel systems and ran into difficulties.  That has been the experience in Australia and Canada, where policy has seen an access programme set up but clinicians do not know whether the substance works and clinical societies have advised that, from a clinical perspective, it is not safe and they do not know whether it treats anything.

N&iacute;l amhras ar bith ach gur n&aacute;ireach na staitistic&iacute; seo.<br\/><br\/>Ba mhaith liom d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an topaic seo mar Ghael &oacute;g.  Ba mhaith liom labhairt faoin bunt&aacute;iste a bhaineann leis an Ghaeilge mar theanga sa t&iacute;r agus conas gur f&eacute;idir linn &iacute; a &uacute;s&aacute;id chomh maith is gur f&eacute;idir linn i bpoist.  C&eacute; go bhfuil an tAcht i bhfeidhm &oacute; 2010, n&iacute;l ach plean gn&iacute;mh &aacute; chur le ch&eacute;ile faoi l&aacute;thair, seacht mbliain ar aghaidh.  Anuraidh, rinneadh com&oacute;radh n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta ar &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach 1916 agus muid ag cuimhneamh ar chlann uile an n&aacute;isi&uacute;in.  C&eacute;ad bliain ar aghaidh, n&iacute;limid ag tabhairt aire do theanga an n&aacute;isi&uacute;in i gceart fi&uacute;.  T&aacute; deiseanna dochreidte i gceist maidir le forbairt &aacute;r dteanga sa tsocha&iacute;.  D&aacute; mbeadh an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge curtha i bhfeidhm i gceart, bheadh pobal na t&iacute;re nua-chothaithe agus spreagtha gan amhras.  N&iacute; fi&uacute; d&uacute;inn a bheith ag briongl&oacute;id faoi 250,000 cainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge sa t&iacute;r muna dtig linn iad a shamhailt le r&oacute;lanna l&aacute;rnacha, iad gn&iacute;omhach agus ag obair sa t&iacute;r le postanna in &Eacute;irinn.<br\/><br\/>Ba cheart is ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an Ghaeilge ag pl&eacute;ascadh amach as na ceantracha Gaeltachta agus as na Gaelscoileanna fud fad na h&Eacute;ireann agus ag dul i bhfeidhm ar phobal uile na t&iacute;re i rith na bliana, i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; d&iacute;reach c&uacute;pla focal le linn Sheachtain na Gaeilge.  N&iacute; leor an b&eacute;alghr&aacute; anois m&aacute; t&aacute;imid i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin&aacute;r dteanga, faoin&aacute;r bpobal is faoin&aacute;r dt&iacute;r.  T&iacute;r gan teanga, t&iacute;r gan anam.  Caithfear n&iacute;os m&oacute; deiseanna a chuir ar f&aacute;il leis an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge a chur i gcr&iacute;ch.  Deir lucht gn&oacute; linn, mar shampla, gur f&eacute;idir linn leas a bhaint as an Ghaeilge i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; marga&iacute;ochta agus turas&oacute;ireachta, ach t&aacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; i gceist le teanga pobail.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  Nearta&iacute;onn teanga an pobal.  Is &iacute; an Ghaeilge bunchloch &aacute;r gcult&uacute;r.  T&aacute; sampla maith den phobal athchothaithe le feice&aacute;il faoi l&aacute;thair sa cheantar tuaithe &oacute; thuaidh i Sleacht N&eacute;ill, &aacute;it ina bhfuil athbheochan cult&uacute;rtha ar si&uacute;l agus an Ghaeilge mar chro&iacute;-l&aacute;r na hathbheochana.<br\/><br\/>Mar a d&uacute;irt M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Cadhain, &quot;Is &iacute; sl&aacute;n&uacute; na Gaeilge athghabh&aacute;il na h&Eacute;ireann&quot;.  N&iacute;l aon amhras orm go raibh an ceart aige.  M&aacute;s rud &eacute; go dtiocfadh linn an Ghaeilge a athchoth&uacute;, bheadh na Gaeil ag smaointi&uacute; faoi postanna in &Eacute;irinn go cinnte.  T&aacute; d&uacute;shl&aacute;in ann go f&iacute;rinne ach m&aacute; thugtar na deiseanna don ghl&uacute;in seo, t&aacute;im d&oacute;chasach go dtiocfaidh linn na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in a chomhl&iacute;onadh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2017030700005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Gr&iacute;ofa"},{"type":"speech","time":1488900000,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an bhfinn&eacute;.

T&aacute; an ardteist ag teacht agus beidh s&eacute; anseo go tapaidh.  Caithfidh m&eacute; a admh&aacute;il, mar dhalta, is saol crua &eacute; saol an scol&aacute;ire.  B&iacute;onn orainn obair l&aacute; i ndiadh lae, &oacute; mhaidin go ho&iacute;che le haghaidh scr&uacute;d&uacute; dodh&eacute;anta agus m&iacute;chothrom a mhaireann breis is dh&aacute; uair go leith.

C&eacute;n f&aacute;th?  Mar, do dhaoine &aacute;irithe, an rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; d&oacute;ibh n&aacute; bheith ar fheabhas ag gach uile rud.  An fhoirfeacht a bh&iacute;onn &aacute; lorg acu.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil br&uacute; orthu sa bhaile &oacute;na dtuismitheoir&iacute; n&oacute; &oacute;na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; ar scoil.  Cuireann s&eacute; sin isteach go m&oacute;r ar a sl&aacute;inte intinne.  Tugann s&eacute; sin ar aghaidh m&eacute; chuig mo dhara phointe faoin d&uacute;lagar.<\/p>  <p>  Glacann an d&uacute;lagar smacht ar shaol ioml&aacute;n an duine, ar bhealach sleamhain, sl&iacute;theanta agus cumhachtach.  De ghn&aacute;th, n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn aon rian fisici&uacute;il le feice&aacute;il.  Fulaing&iacute;onn duine as gach deichni&uacute;r idir tr&iacute; bliana d&eacute;ag d&rsquo;aois agus naoi mbliana d&eacute;ag d&rsquo;aois leis an d&uacute;lagar.  C&uacute;pla blian &oacute; shin, chaill m&eacute; cara le f&eacute;inmhar&uacute;.  Bh&iacute;os an-mh&oacute;r leis ach f&oacute;s f&eacute;in n&iacute; raibh a fhios agam go raibh s&eacute; ag fulaingt go dona leis an d&uacute;lagar.  Duine greannmhar agus fuinni&uacute;il ab ea &eacute; agus bh&iacute;nn ag g&aacute;ire an t-am go l&eacute;ir leis.  Cheap m&eacute; nach raibh c&iacute;os c&aacute;s n&aacute; cath&uacute; air ach nach ormsa a bh&iacute; an dul am&uacute;.  N&iacute;or labhair s&eacute; le haon duine faoin d&uacute;lagar agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir liom mo cheann a chur timpeall air sin.  N&iacute;or oscail s&eacute; a bh&eacute;al chun cabhair a lorg.  Cuireann s&eacute; isteach go m&oacute;r ar mo chro&iacute; gur cheap s&eacute; nach mbeadh s&eacute; in ann cabhair a fh&aacute;il.  Bh&iacute; fonn &eacute;al&uacute; air agus roghnaigh seisean an tsl&iacute; is measa ar domhain chun cr&iacute;och a chur lena fhadhb.<\/p>  <p>  Tarla&iacute;onn ruda&iacute; cos&uacute;il leis seo gach uile l&aacute; agus thosnaigh m&eacute; ag ceisti&uacute; &aacute;r socha&iacute;.  Cad at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn chun a l&eacute;iri&uacute; do dhaoine faoi ghruaim go bhfuil ualach cabhrach ar f&aacute;il sa t&iacute;r?  N&iacute;l aon r&eacute;iteach tapaidh air seo ach caithfimid tos&uacute; ag d&eacute;anamh jab n&iacute;os fearr aire a thabhairt do na daoine &oacute;ga at&aacute; ag fulaingt sa t&iacute;r seo.  Tugann s&eacute; sin ar aghaidh m&eacute; chuig mo phointe dheireanach.<\/p>  <p>  N&iacute; m&oacute;r don Rialtas airgead a chur ar f&aacute;il do na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; a chuireann seirbhis&iacute; ar f&aacute;il, mar shampla, Pieta House.  D&eacute;anann siad s&aacute;r-jab ag cabhr&uacute; le daoine &oacute;ga in am an gh&aacute;tair.<\/p> <p>Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh cabhair proifisi&uacute;nta ar f&aacute;il sna scoileanna chun cabhr&uacute; le scol&aacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; faoi bhr&uacute; &oacute;n gc&oacute;ras oideachais.  In&aacute;r scoilse t&aacute; beirt ghairm threora&iacute; go leith againn agus n&iacute; leor sin in aon chor do scoil le daonra scol&aacute;ire thar 1,400.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r do Facebook, Twitter agus na me&aacute;in cumars&aacute;ide sin gach ar f&eacute;idir leo a dh&eacute;anamh chun deireadh a chur le bula&iacute;ocht ar l&iacute;ne agus chun faire amach dos na daoine &oacute;ga a bhaineann &uacute;s&aacute;id as na su&iacute;omhanna sin.  Caithfidh an coiste agus an Rialtas a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil dlithe sa Bhunreacht a dh&eacute;ile&aacute;ileann leo si&uacute;d ata i mbun na bula&iacute;ochta ar l&iacute;ne.<\/p> <p> Cloistear sc&eacute;alta go minic faoi dhaoine c&aacute;ili&uacute;la a labhrann go hoscailte faoina bhfulaingt f&eacute;in leis an nd&uacute;lagar, mar shampla, Bressie, a labhair amach sa bhliain 2014 faoina dheacrachta&iacute; f&eacute;in.  Spreag a sc&eacute;al fl&uacute;irse daoine &oacute;ga chun a bh&iacute; ag cur as d&oacute;ibh a phl&eacute; n&oacute; &eacute; a lua le duine f&aacute;sta.<\/p> <p> M&aacute;s rud &eacute; n&aacute;ch dt&oacute;gann baill an choiste aon rud eile &oacute;n &oacute;r&aacute;id seo, t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtuigeann siad &eacute; seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; de cheart againn ar fad s&uacute;p is s&aacute;samh a bhaint as &aacute;r saoil agus muna mbraitheann duine 100%, t&aacute; s&eacute; sin ceart go leor.  T&aacute; cabhair ann, ach caithfimid mar shocha&iacute; jab n&iacute;os fearr a dh&eacute;anamh chun an cabhair sin a fh&oacute;gairt.  Mar a d&uacute;irt Donal Walsh, is r&eacute;iteach bhuan &eacute; f&eacute;inmhar&uacute; ar fhadhb shealadach.  T&aacute; sl&iacute; eile &eacute;al&uacute; &oacute;n ndorchadas, ach n&iacute; h&eacute; f&eacute;inmhar&uacute; an freagra riamh.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste as an &eacute;isteacht b&eacute;asach.  Rachel Lingwood is ainm dom agus is iad sin mo thuairim&iacute; faoi fh&eacute;inmhar&uacute; agus daoine &oacute;ga.

Is &aacute;bhar f&iacute;or-chonsp&oacute;ideach &eacute; seo gan dabht agus ba mhaith liomsa c&uacute;lra n&oacute; stair na consp&oacute;ide a thabhairt ar dt&uacute;s.  Bh&iacute; dl&iacute; frith-ghinmhillte sa t&iacute;r seo in 1861.  De r&eacute;ir Acht um Chionta in Aghaidh an Duine, cuireadh pr&iacute;os&uacute;nacht ar bhean ar bith a rinne iarracht ginmhilleadh a fh&aacute;il muna raibh bagairt siceola&iacute;ocht l&aacute;ithreach ann.  Bh&iacute; eagla ar dreamanna difri&uacute;la sa t&iacute;r a bh&iacute; i gcoinne an Ieas&uacute; seo go raibh an dains&eacute;ar ann go ngIacadh breitheamh ciall eile as na focal &quot;bagairt siceola&iacute;ocht&quot; agus go mbeadh ginmhilleadh ceadaithe.  Mar sin chuir siad br&uacute; ar an Rialtas reifreann a bheith ann leis na focal a athr&uacute; ionas go mbeadh s&eacute; an-deacair ginmhilleadh a fh&aacute;il.  Ba &eacute; seo an t-ocht&uacute; leas&uacute; i mBunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann in 1983.  Deir an leas&uacute; a leanas: &quot;Admha&iacute;onn an St&aacute;t ceart na mbeo gan breith chun a mbeatha agus, ag f&eacute;achaint go cu&iacute; do chomhcheart na m&aacute;thar chun a beatha, r&aacute;tha&iacute;onn s&eacute; gan cur isteach lena dhl&iacute;the ar an gceart sin agus r&aacute;tha&iacute;onn f&oacute;s an ceart sin a chosaint is a shu&iacute;omh lena dhl&iacute;the sa mh&eacute;id gur f&eacute;idir &eacute;&quot;.  Ghlac an pobal leis an reifreann sin.<br\/><br\/>Mh&uacute;scail an reifreann seo dearca&iacute; eags&uacute;la &oacute; dhreamanna difri&uacute;la sa t&iacute;r agus bh&iacute; dream m&oacute;r a bh&iacute; go huile agus go hioml&aacute;n i gcoinne an leas&uacute; seo.  Tharla c&uacute;pla rud i ndiaidh sin a thug an t-easaontas chun tosaigh ar&iacute;s.  In 1984, chuir sc&eacute;al scanr&uacute;il sc&aacute;faireach Ann Lovett br&oacute;n agus uaf&aacute;s ar phobal na t&iacute;re.  Girseach bheag &oacute;g c&uacute;ig bliana d&eacute;ag d'aois a bh&iacute; inti, dh&aacute; bhliain n&iacute;os &oacute;ige na m&eacute; fh&eacute;in ag an am.  D&rsquo;fh&aacute;g s&iacute; a scoil ag am l&oacute;in.  L&aacute; fuar, fliuch, c&aacute;idheach a bh&iacute; ann.  Rug s&iacute; breith ar Ieanbh beag b&iacute;deach faoi dhealbh na Maighdine Muire.  Thainig p&aacute;ist&iacute; beaga uirthi ar maidin an lae arna mh&aacute;rach agus &iacute; ar imeall an bh&aacute;is agus corp a linbh beag cl&uacute;daithe ina c&oacute;ta f&eacute;in.  Fuair Ann bocht b&aacute;s ar an turas go dt&iacute; an ospid&eacute;al.  Tharla seo bliain i ndiaidh an t-ocht&uacute; leas&uacute;, dl&iacute; a cuireadh i bhfeidhm chun beatha a chosaint.  Is soil&eacute;ir gur a mhalairt a tharla.  Bh&iacute; an t&iacute;r n&aacute;irithe.<br\/><br\/>In 1992, tharla rud uaf&aacute;sach eile ar a tugadh c&aacute;s X. Ar&iacute;s, girseach &oacute;g 14 bliana d&rsquo;aois a bh&iacute; i gceist.  Bh&iacute; s&iacute; ag iompair clainne de bharr coir uaf&aacute;sacha &eacute;agn&uacute; a d&rsquo;fhulaing s&iacute;.  N&iacute; raibh s&iacute; ag iarradh an p&aacute;iste a bheith aici agus bh&iacute; smaoint&iacute; f&eacute;in-mharaithe aici feasta.  Bh&iacute; s&iacute; ar a bealach go Sasana le ginmhilleadh a fh&aacute;il ach cuireadh stop l&eacute;i.  Bh&iacute; rac&aacute;n sa t&iacute;r ar&iacute;s.  Chuaigh an c&aacute;s go dt&iacute; an C&uacute;irt Uachtarach agus d&uacute;irt an breitheamh go raibh an ceart ag bean ginmhilleadh a fh&aacute;il m&aacute; bh&iacute; a saol i mbaol.<br\/><br\/>Ansin tharla sc&eacute;al millteanach br&oacute;nach Savita Halappanavar c&uacute;ig bliana &oacute; shin.  Bh&iacute; cuimhneamh ag mo thuismitheoir&iacute; ar na c&aacute;sanna eile agus bh&iacute; m&eacute; &aacute;balta ceisteanna a chur orthu faoi caid&eacute; a bh&iacute; ag dul ar aghaidh ag an am, ach t&aacute; cuimhneamh agam fh&eacute;in ar an gc&aacute;s seo.  Fuair Savita b&aacute;s i ndiaidh breith mhairfeach sheipteach.  Fuair an leanbh b&aacute;s chomh maith ach rinneadh an sc&eacute;al trag&oacute;ideach seo n&iacute;os measa mar go bhf&eacute;adfadh saol Savita a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il.  Nuair a bh&iacute; a fhios acu nach dtiocfadh leis an leanbh teacht ar an saol beo, d&uacute;irt s&iacute; go raibh s&iacute; ag iarraidh foirceannadh.  Dhi&uacute;ltaigh siad &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh agus fi&uacute; d&uacute;radh l&eacute;i nach nd&eacute;anfadh siad &eacute; sin, mar a d&uacute;irt siad fh&eacute;in, &quot;This is a Catholic country.&quot;  Bh&iacute; muid n&aacute;irithe ar&iacute;s.<br\/><br\/>Chruthaigh a b&aacute;s fearg agus frustrachas i measc cuid mh&oacute;r daoine sa t&iacute;r agus bh&iacute; daoine ag iarraidh dl&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh a bheadh soil&eacute;ir.  &Oacute; na casanna seo uilig t&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;-shoil&eacute;ir gur topaic iontach casta agus achrannach &eacute; seo ach caithfear r&eacute;iteach f&oacute;irsteanach a fh&aacute;il air.  Gach uile l&aacute; t&eacute;ann ar a laghad deich mban trasna go Sasana le ginmhilleadh a fh&aacute;il, thar 3,500 sa bhliain.  De r&eacute;ir fianaise at&aacute; foilsithe ag an Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, cuireadh tuairim is 1,600 piolla&iacute; ginmhille chun na t&iacute;re seo idir 2010 agus 2012.  T&aacute; tuairim&iacute; an-l&aacute;idir ag an d&aacute; thaobh at&aacute; ag arg&oacute;int faoi.  C&eacute; at&aacute; ceart?  An bhfuil ceart n&oacute; citeach ann?  C&eacute; a shocr&oacute;idh &eacute;?  L&eacute;anfaidh an consp&oacute;id ar aghaidh bliain i ndiaidh bliana agus mar sin t&aacute; socr&uacute; ag gabh&aacute;il orainn go luath, agus t&aacute; an socr&uacute; sin ag brath ar na polaiteoir&iacute;.<br\/><br\/>T&aacute; an t-&aacute;bhar seo i mb&eacute;al an phobail.  Fi&uacute; rinne <i>The Irish Times<\/i>suirbh&eacute; ar an topaic seo an Aoine seo caite.  Seo roinnt de na ceisteanna a bh&iacute; i gceist.  Ar cheart do bhean cead ginmhilleadh a fh&aacute;il ma t&aacute; s&iacute; ag iompar clainne de bharr &eacute;igni&uacute; n&oacute; ciorr&uacute; coil?  Bh&iacute; 77% i bhf&aacute;bhar ginmhilleadh sa ch&aacute;s sin.  Fosta, ar cheart di cead ginmhilleadh a bheith aici m&aacute; t&aacute; f&eacute;atas marfach m&iacute;-normalta ag an leanbh?  Bh&iacute; 76% i bhf&aacute;bhar sin.  Chomh maith le sin, t&aacute; ceisteanna eile a gcaithfear smaoineamh air.  Ar cheart do bhean a cearta bun&uacute;sacha a bheith aici agus a rogha fh&eacute;in a dh&eacute;anamh?  An bhfuil cearta ar bith ag an athair?  C&aacute; huair go bhfuil f&eacute;atas ina leanbh?  Caid&eacute; faoi chearta an Iinbh sin nach bhfuil ar an tsaol go f&oacute;ill?<br\/><br\/>T&aacute; s&eacute; doiligh freagra&iacute; cearta a thabhairt ar na ceisteanna seo gan dabht.

Is t&iacute;r neamhsple&aacute;ch muid, ach c&eacute; chomh neamhsple&aacute;ch is at&aacute;imid i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re?

Chomh maith, t&aacute; bearna m&oacute;r sa domhan i gcomhair chaomhn&uacute; timpeallachta.

Cinnte, mar shampla, thiocfadh linn a bheith mar cheannr&oacute;daithe &oacute; thaobh &aacute;bhair a hathchurs&aacute;il san Eoraip, rud a chruth&oacute;dh go leor fosta&iacute;ochta.  N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sin ach is f&eacute;idir linn a bheith mar cheannr&oacute;daithe &oacute; thaobh fhuinnimh in-athnuaite - fuinnimh at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il uainn gan amhras - agus ruda&iacute; eile a chruth&oacute;dh go leor fosta&iacute;ochta.
