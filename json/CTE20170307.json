I will keep it succinct because the committee has the written presentation.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of key objectives that we are trying to reach with this charter for students and parents.  One is to fill what we feel is a gap in the Education Act 1998 by setting out in this legislation the principles that schools must apply in their engagement with students and parents.  If one looks at the 1998 Act, one will see some measures that relate to parents or to students but one does not see any cohesive set of principles that set out the way parents or students should be treated by a school.  That is the first objective and that will be done in the proposed legislation by replacing the existing section 28, which speaks about grievances narrowly, with much broader legislation.  The key thing we are trying to achieve here is a change of culture.  Having a statutory charter would bring about changes in how schools interact with parents.  The key thing is that if things are done differently at the beginning, or on a day-to-day basis, difficult grievances do not arise or are minimised, simply because the issues are resolved in advance.  The charter is about coming at this in a different way than before and trying to front-load measures that will bring about a change of culture.<\/p> <p>  The second key piece is that we ultimately arrive at a standardised parent and student charter in all schools.  The legislation itself is enabling.  It sets things out.  The key piece of work will begin after enactment, if the Oireachtas decides to enact it.  That will be when the Department will have to sit down with the education partners to work out the details and to put flesh on the charter.  The Minister is given the power to make them the statutory guidelines.  We see that work being done in the manner in which we work with our education partners on many things, that is, where we get together in a room and around a table and have working groups.  That is what we mean by consultation when the Bill talks about the Minister producing the guidelines based on consultation that will have taken place.  The principles I spoke of at the beginning are sort of the basic skeleton, the Bible if you like, that has to be followed in the making of the guidelines.  The real piece of work will be there.<\/p> <p>  The third key piece we are doing here is the linkage with the Ombudsman for Children.  We see that as quite important.  It brings in a set of measures where the Ombudsman is not stopped from proceeding with an investigation or examination of a matter simply because an appeal within the school has not concluded, which is the current legal position.  One of the heads of the Bill is to remove that.  The other is to give the Ombudsman the capacity to examine matters within the charter.  The charter itself will be extensive in terms of the things it will cover.  They are in the papers we presented.  Critically, if the Ombudsman then makes recommendations to a school, either in a formal space or after a formal investigation, this head makes legal provision for the Ombudsman to write to the Minister and say that he or she is unhappy with a situation and that the school does not seem to be taking his recommendations on board.  The Minister can then raise that with the school.  It is provided for in the law that the school can respond but that ultimately the Minister can give a direction.  We have a mechanism here that can bring about change in the school in what is hoped will be the small number of cases that will ultimately arise and arrive with the Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Hanevy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Like Mr. Hanevy, I will shorten what I have to say in light of the limited time available.

While the committee will be aware that the Ombudsman for Children is independent in its function, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is a public body that comes under the aegis of the Department and is funded through the Department's Vote.

As was stated earlier, the Ombudsman for Children's office, OCO,  is an independent human rights institution established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to promote and monitor the rights of children in Ireland.  We examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administrative actions of public bodies.  We are independent and impartial, and act neither as an advocate for the child nor as an adversary of the public body.  We respect and promote local complaints procedures, and we aim to achieve systemic change that addresses the root causes of complaints.<\/p> <p>  I am statutorily obliged to consider the best interests of the child and to give due to consideration to the wishes of the child, in accordance with age and understanding.  I also have a statutory remit to promote and monitor the rights and welfare of children.  This involves a number of actions, one of which is to advise on legislation as I am doing today.  It is the opinion of my office that the general scheme of the Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill sets out a sound legislative framework to improve engagement between schools, students and parents.  It will also increase consistency across schools' complaints handling practices.  The implementation of a charter across all schools will see a cultural shift in how they operate.  It will see a move away from reacting to and dealing with grievances after they occur.  Instead, schools will have to engage proactively with students and parents to establish their views and positively invite feedback, and will have to be open to concerns and negative comments.  The early identification of concerns will allow problems to be considered and dealt with by the school, and will minimise or avoid reliance on formal compliant procedures.  The guidelines on the charter will also include procedures to deal with any grievances that occur once the charter is in place.<\/p> <p>  This very much complies with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, and will be a significant move towards fulfilling commitments made by all the Departments under the national policy framework for children and young people, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  In February 2016, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that Ireland should ensure the Education Act 1998 is amended to guarantee the right of the child to be heard in individual cases.  By bringing forward this Bill, the Minister is beginning the implementation of that recommendation.  The Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill provides an opportunity for the general principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to be incorporated in legislation, both through specific provisions and at a more general level.  The full implementation of Article 12 in this educational context is of particular importance because it enshrines children&rsquo;s right to freely express their views in all matters involving or affecting them. <\/p> <p>  The Bill also seeks to strengthen the role of my office when dealing with complaints about schools.  In 2015, some 45% of the complaints we received were about education and of those, three quarters related to individual schools.  In our experience, local resolution involving children, parents and boards of management leads to fast and effective conclusions.  However, there are cases where more difficult complaints arise and it is important that there is a robust system in place.  This Bill would require boards of management to consider any suggestions, guidance or recommendations issued by my office and would provide the Minister for Education and Skills with a power of direction in respect of the encouragements or recommendations of my office.  It should be noted that this is likely to be used sparingly. <\/p> <p>  While this legislation will strengthen the work my office can do with schools, the statutory role and independence of the OCO will in no way be compromised.  I wish to emphasise the importance of consulting with children and young people at policy level when developing the legislation that will provide for the establishment of the charter.  If we move forward with a change-around in terminology to call it a student and parent charter, this would put the emphasis on children.  Children should also have their views taken into account when developing individual school charters. <\/p> <p>  In respect of the Education (Amendment) Bill 2015, I last appeared before this committee on 21 October 2015, the same day that Deputy Jim Daly first presented his Private Members' Bill to the D&aacute;il.  As outlined in our submission today, I believe that the Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill addresses the issue of principals and boards who do not respond to the encouragements and recommendations of my office.  Establishing an ombudsman for education with legally binding powers would add another legal layer without addressing the systemic problem.  It would result in confusion and new legal costs for schools and families, many of whom may not be able to afford such costs.  This would change the whole dynamic of complaint handling and would undoubtedly lead to longer delays.  I feel strongly that it would demotivate parents and carers from bringing complaints.  <\/p> <p>  It is also important to note that from a practical point of view, in respect of many of the complaints received by my office, while the main issue may be education related, there may be aspects involving disability, health, children in care, housing or other issues.  At present my office has the ability to address such complaints in their entirety.  This allows us to work across various Departments and organisations to achieve local resolution, or to effectively investigate a complaint. <\/p> <p>  Since I last appeared before this committee, Part V of the Education Act has been implemented.  This allows for professional conduct issues to be properly addressed via the Teaching Council.  This was a change called for by the OCO since we were set up.  I expect that this will have a significant impact on complaints handling in schools and will afford parents a much more direct route to complain about professional misconduct.  <\/p> <p>  Since the establishment of the OCO, we have investigated many education complaints and our recommendations have contributed to positive systemic change in a number of areas.  In individual schools, too, we have successfully worked with principals and boards during preliminary inquiries.  We work to improve communications with parents and children, to highlight and alleviate gaps in policies and to enhance engagement with students.  We look forward to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill which will introduce designation, called for by this office after we published an investigation into a case where one student was refused access to 28 schools.  In 2016, we published a report on complaints received regarding the State Examination Commission&rsquo;s reasonable accommodations for certificate examinations, RACE, scheme, which provides exam supports for children with specific learning needs.  This scheme has since been reviewed.  Our Education In Focus report, published in 2016, outlines other work carried out by the office in the area of education.  I very much believe that the parent and student charter would place Ireland in a strong position internationally in respect of our obligations under the UNCRC and it would attest strongly to the Government&rsquo;s promise to deliver on the commitments made under Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  It is the opinion of my office that the parent and student charter would best serve children and young people by developing a culture of participation and engagement.  It also provides a robust complaints procedure in those cases where a local resolution cannot be achieved.  I look forward to working with the committee in advancing this legislation in the best interests of children.  I thank the members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon for his submissions on the two Bills in addition to his own statement.

Our offices work very closely together and our views on these matters are shared.  I would obviously defer to Dr. Muldoon on the issues of the charter in so far as it affects the rights of children.  I am fully supportive of his remarks.<\/p> <p>  I want particularly to address proposals for the creation of a new ombudsman for education.  I have concerns about this, which I think are similar to those expressed by Dr. Muldoon.  The first is that most of these proposals relate to schools.  Much of the work of my office is in the field of education.  Much of that is in further and higher education, including issues about access to education for students with disabilities; grants for further and higher education; and the administration of universities and institutions of further and higher education.  This is a significant piece of work and, if we were to have something called an education ombudsman, it would create confusion in the mind of the public.  People would automatically assume that matters of further and higher education - grants and so on - would rest with that office.<\/p><p>That is a general concern about confusion.<\/p><p> There is another concern about creating a proliferation of ombudsmen's offices.  People need to know where to go.  Currently, they do.  If more offices are created, though, confusion can be created.  Across the water in the UK, there was a growth in the number of ombudsmen.  This caused a great deal of confusion and is now leading to legislation to consolidate offices.  We do not want to repeat the mistakes of others.  That is not to say that I disagree with the intentions, given that they are correct.  Some of Dr. Muldoon's remarks in support of that are important to bear in mind.<\/p><p> Speaking as the Ombudsman for public services, those services are democratically accountable to Members of the Oireachtas in respect of Departments and Government agencies or to local authorities.  That means that ombudsmen's recommendations, which do not have the force of law, are almost always observed.  In the 31-year history of my office, only one recommendation has not been implemented.  In the case of private sector ombudsmen, however, mechanisms are needed to ensure that their recommendations are delivered upon, given that the same democratic accountability does not exist.  The proposals giving the Minister the capacity to make directions would achieve that.<\/p><p> I draw the committee's attention to a final point.  Were a new office to be established, we would have all of the costs and delays associated with its establishment.  We would have to recruit someone, find premises and provide the office with ICT and it would have to develop processes and procedures.  All of that takes time and money.  Were the powers of existing offices to be extended, however, it would simply be a matter of recruiting new staff who could undertake that work within processes, procedures and a management structure that already exist and offices that have a record of delivering.<\/p><p> The Oireachtas needs to achieve what is proposed, but it can be done within the context of the existing framework.  The legislation that is on the table to extend those powers and jurisdictions would have the necessary effect without creating confusion and incurring costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tyndall.

The issues arising from both Bills are our bread and butter.  Every day we receive complaints from parents about schools after they have gone through local complaints processes, contacted the Department of Education and Skills and the Ombudsman for Children's office, which redirects them to local resolutions, and the boards of management will not budge on decisions.  If parents are at the start of that process, we usually talk them through it so as to ensure that they do not go down the wrong avenue before contacting the Ombudsman for Children's office.  After they have done that and still do not have a resolution, though, they are often in a dire psychological state.  I have personal experience of that, believe it or not.  I have been there with a board of management.  I have also sat on a board of management, so I am well aware of how boards operate and the challenges of having that responsibility.<\/p> <p>  These complaints are the bread and butter of the Ombudsman for Children's office, with 45% of them relating to education.  We have concerns about the capacity of the office to conduct investigations in a timely fashion.  Its own reports indicate that although there may be a resolution in a case, the child has either aged out of the school or the parent has voluntarily, albeit under pressure, removed the child to a new school placement.  That is not necessarily in the best interests of the child or parent in terms of the former's educational pathway.  Were the Ombudsman for Children's remit to be extended, we would like it to have greater capacity so that the investigation process could be undertaken in a timely fashion.  In the interim, we advocate for a formal, free advocacy or mediation service, be that under the auspices of the Ombudsman's office or an external service, whereby schools and parents can find local resolutions.  Some schools have funded mediation, particularly where there have been heated disputes, but doing so is up to each school.  The parent is often not in a position to afford a mediator and the school may be reluctant to allow in an external person.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Daly introduced the Education (Amendment) Bill 2015.  I have been giving out about the problem with boards of management for a considerable length of time, so I commend the Deputy on introducing the Bill and recognise that, as an ex-principal, it was difficult for him to do.  We find that many boards side with their principals' opinions and defer to their day-to-day managers regardless of whether they have different opinions on a case.  As long as the theme and intentions of the Education (Amendment) Bill are fulfilled within the parent and student charter, we would welcome whichever Bill proceeds if there is a solution that is external to the boards of management - another pathway for a parent to take where the interests of the child are paramount - and the Minister has the power to make the board's decisions accountable.<\/p> <p>  In the decision-making process, the balance of power in schools has shifted towards the boards of management.  This can have an impact.  For example, if the relationship between the parent and the principal breaks down, the latter has the power to sway board decisions.  The principal can also withhold information from the board - I have seen this at first hand - and, therefore, a board's decision is often not based on the reality of the situation or the complaint.  Parents try to subvert this process by contacting the parents' representatives on boards so as to ensure that the latter have whatever correspondence or complaints have been delivered to the board's chair.  As such, I would welcome better accountability in the decision-making processes of boards and oversight of how they reached a decision.<\/p> <p>  In general, we recommend the proposals in the parent and student charter, which would provide for parents and students to be treated more equally and with greater esteem.  The self-esteem of a parent who is fighting for a child's rights can be battered by the power that boards of management hold within the system, especially when there is no \"out\" if the decision is contrary to what the parent would like to see.<\/p> <p>  We have submitted observations on the heads of the Bill.  Some aspects have left us questioning the decision-making processes between the Ombudsman for Children and the Minister for Education and Skills.  For example, if the Ombudsman advises schools on a pathway to a resolution but they disregard it, at what point does the Ombudsman approach the Minister, would that be timely and what would be the timeline for the Minister to respond to the difficulties at the schools?<\/p> <p>  The Bill appears to give boards the right to reply to the Minister's office.  We would ask that the parents concerned and student body also be given that right.  Otherwise, an unbalanced power will be given to the boards.<\/p> <p>  Head No. 4 is unclear as to who would inform the Minister of a school charter's non-compliance with the Bill's proposed guidelines.  Would that be picked up through a complaint or the inspectorate?<\/p> <p>  One of the Bills seeks to establish a separate office of an ombudsman for education that would have a restrictive remit, given that education spans a broad area beyond just schools.  On the other hand, there is a proposal to extend the powers of the Ombudsman for Children.  As long as the outcomes are positive for parents and their children, we do not mind which pathway is chosen.  I assume that the decision will come down to the financial considerations.<\/p><p>It is proposed that student councils would give more regard to the interests of the students within a school than the school itself.  We want that same powerful principle to apply to any decision-making by boards of management.  Protectionism and risk aversion have strangled decision making in boards of management.  The outcomes are not always in the best interest of the child but influenced by insurance and indemnities, fear and ignorance, misinformation and lack of internal transparency, and fear of legal action by parties concerned. It may be timely for the Department of Education and Skills, managerial bodies and education stakeholders to review the composition, functions and processes of boards of management in line with the processes under pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dempsey.

The Ombudsman for Children and his office works collaboratively and effectively with schools and professional organisations such as ourselves in representing the voice of children.  It encourages schools to have robust and effective policies and practices in place to promote the welfare and the rights of children.<\/p> <p>  The provisions of the Education (Parent &amp;amp; Student Charter) Bill as outlined will strengthen the current role of the Ombudsman for Children.  In doing so it will eliminate the necessity to establish an ombudsman for education, for all the reasons that have been put forward by other speakers today.  The number of pieces of legislation in recent years has created a considerable stranglehold on an already oversubscribed sector.  The current system can include the Ombudsman for Children's office in the new charter.  We believe it is unnecessary to consider an ombudsman for education.<\/p> <p>  The IPPN welcomes and supports the provision of a parent and student charter, particularly when the focus is on fostering culture change within school communities to prevent grievances from arising.  Schools are all about prevention.  If we address things at an early stage in any grievance, that is the best possible way to deal with complaints.  As outlined in the parent and student charter, we believe that this focus on culture change would enhance that.  Schools currently work collaboratively at primary level with parents and pupils to promote the welfare and rights of children.  We welcome the setting out in law of principles of engagement with students and parents.  It is well-established that a significant number of primary schools have a well-functioning parents' association.  Those that do not are currently looking creatively at establishing parents' associations.  Working collaboratively with parents underpins everything that our organisation adheres to.  Primary schools have engaged in recent years with establishing student councils.  I am an advocate for that.  It has worked very well in my school.  We have seen very good examples of student councils working extremely well at primary level.<\/p> <p>  Current procedures used to address parental complaints in schools have been agreed by management bodies and unions.  I am aware they have not been agreed to by the National Parents Council.  However, these procedures are not underpinned by legislation.  They have in the past and are currently widely interpreted, often giving rise to confusion and conflict.  Schools will require significant assistance in drafting individual parent and student charters as there could be a variety of interpretations of the elements outlined in the legislation, which would be counter-productive.  We would be happy to see the complementary role of the parent and student charter and the school self evaluation mode mentioned in the parent and student charter outline.  It is viewed by the IPPN as a very positive move.<\/p> <p>  I am heartened to hear from the Department that the skeleton of this charter is currently there, and that the details of this charter will be worked out with the partners in education.  That has worked very well with the Department and ourselves heretofore.  We look forward to examining the detail and influencing how it will look when finished.<\/p> <p>  We are all about resolution. Schools are all about resolution, not about conflict.  If we look to this parent and student charter as it is evolving, we do not see that the establishment of an ombudsman for education is warranted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Doyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.<\/p> <p>  In 2012, the National Parents Council, NPC, made a submission to the then Minister for Education, requesting a strengthening of the role of parents in the Education Act.  The research overwhelmingly supports the benefits of parents' involvement in their children's education.  Before making its submission to the Minister in 2012, the NPC examined the status of parents and parental involvement in the Irish primary education system.  A significant amount of policy supporting parental involvement ranging from the literacy and numeracy for learning and life strategy, to school inspection procedures and many other policy areas was evident from this examination.  However, despite the range of policies and procedures that have been developed that reinforce parental involvement in schools, parents consistently report to the NPC that they do not feel supported to be involved in the key partnership role they have in their  children's education.  <\/p> <p>  The NPC examined the legislation regarding parental involvement and further examined directives to schools in the form of circulars issued.  Irish legislation, namely the Education Act, gives express rights to parents and responsibilities to school boards of management in supporting parents.  However, compared to other jurisdictions, Irish legislation is quite limiting in its reach, in particular in regard to school planning regarding parental involvement.  The legislation does not provide in depth direction to schools.  However, Circular 24\/91, \"Parents as partners in education\", issued by the Department of Education and Skills, did give clear guidance to schools in regard to the involvement of parents in their children's education.<\/p><p>The circular contained a number of key instructions for schools regarding their role in working with parents as partners in schools.  The NPC wished to learn to what extent parents had experienced the benefits of the implementation of the circular in their school and therefore initiated a survey to its membership to assess the impact for parents of Circular 24\/91.  Broadly, this is the background to how we came at the parent and student charter, and we welcome the general scheme of the education (parent and student charter) Bill.  The Bill broadly encapsulates the submissions and representations the NPC has made to the Department of Education and Skills and the Ministers over the past five years.  We know that when parents are engaged and involved in their children&rsquo;s education the children do better, and creating the right environment and culture in a school for parents and children to be active partners in school life is critical to this involvement.  The NPC believes the general scheme of the education (parent and student charter) Bill 2016 provides the legislative basis for the necessary change in schools to take place.<\/p><p> The NPC welcomes the statement of statutory principles under head 3 and agrees with all of the principles as laid out.  The NPC requests the inclusion of an additional principle, or the extension of the first principle, reflecting the values in the second principle.  This would give acknowledgement to the importance of the students' voice and participation in their own learning and progress.  This part of the Bill gives this to parents but we feel it could also be given to students.<\/p><p> The NPC supports the inclusion of head 4 and believes it is vital the Minister has powers to direct school boards to comply with the guidelines on the parent and student charter.  The NPC's survey in 2012 showed a lack of awareness by parents of Circular 24\/91 on parents as partners in education, and furthermore showed parents did not experience the provisions contained in the circular.  For example, Circular 24\/91 states each national school is required to establish as part of its overall school policy or plan, a clearly defined written policy for productive parental involvement.  The response from parents when asked if they knew whether their school had a parental involvement policy was that only 17% said they knew that their school did so.  It is vital that any legislation developed in this area is robust in ensuring parents and students are able to experience the benefits of its provisions.<\/p><p> The NPC particularly welcomes the expanded role of the Ombudsman for Children as set out in the general scheme.  The Education (Amendment) Bill 2015 is useful in setting out the challenges and possible way forward in addressing them.  The NPC believes the expanded role of the Ombudsman for Children, as set out in the education (parent and student charter) Bill, addresses the issues raised in the Education (Amendment) Bill and negates the need for a separate ombudsman for education.  The Education (Amendment) Bill drew attention to the deficiencies in the system that resulted in parents and students feeling they had nowhere to go with concerns and complaints if they felt their issues had not been addressed at school level.  Expanding the role of the Ombudsman for Children will address these issues and will ensure a one stop facility to which parents and students can go with their concerns.  As we know from other areas of policy and practice, dividing children's issues across Departments and services often leads to overlap and gaps, with significant work, financial resources and time spent establishing links.<\/p><p> The NPC welcomes the amendment to section 9 of the 1998 Act to insert the additional function of a school to promote the involvement of parents and students in the education provided to students.  The NPC believes head 9 completely supports the first principle outlined in head 3.  If the parent and student charter is underpinned by placing the student at the centre of school life and securing optimum outcomes for each student in his or her learning and holistic development, we know from research that parents are essential to the delivery of this principle, so ensuring a function of the school is to promote the involvement of parents and students in the education provided to students becomes vital.<\/p><p> The NPC supports the amendment of section 27 of the 1998 Act in clarifying the purpose of a student council in promoting the interests of students as distinct from the interests of the school.  The interests of the school will be better served if the student council promotes the interests of students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank everybody for their insights and observations on the Bills before us.

I appreciate many of them were made aware of the meeting at very short notice, and we appreciate the effort they have made.  This is an historic day, as it is the first time in the history of the Houses a Private Members' Bill and a Government Bill have been brought to committee side by side for pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is a very welcome development.  It is 20 years since the Education Act 1998, one of the most significant and progressive pieces of legislation brought through the Houses, and nothing has had the same impact on education.<\/p> <p>  I am not saying this in a boastful way, but there is no doubt none of this would be in this room if the Education (Amendment) Bill had not been published in 2015 and brought this issue to a head, albeit 20 years too late to enact section 28 of the Education Act.  The genesis of my Bill was frustration.  Coming from the inside, as I am a former principal as was acknowledged by Ms Dempsey for which I thank her, and now being a parent, and having dealt with boards of management and witnessed the trials and travails of other parents I was blown away.  This is because of the system we inherited, which probably goes back to the days of the church when the religious did the schooling for us and the State was able to operate a hands-off policy.  To this very day we take great advantage of this gap.  Most parents believe if a problem arises they can write to the Minister and get it sorted.  Of course we know they will be told the Minister has nothing at all to do with it and it is down to the board of management.  In my days as a principal I was told by someone in a trade union that the most important decision I would make as principal was to pick the parents on the board of management because I needed to surround myself with a good body of people who would say \"yes\" to me at all times.  This was the basis of the selection criteria for a board of management.  I understand the good reason for this.  It is not disparaging about anybody, it is just a fact of life.  The IPPN is before the committee representing principals.  I am a former member of the organisation, and I have great memories and great time for what it does, but I can understand how an ombudsman for education would not be popular with its members because it is another layer of scrutiny.<\/p> <p>  We must be mindful of the times in which we live.  Tonight I will be on Vincent Browne's television show and I will speak about the Grace case, the Tuam babies and all of the shames of our past.  We all have a responsibility to face up in the present and do what we can to bring openness and transparency.  We have a responsibility to do more than just defend our patch, which is the line I would like to bring across today.  If we do not accept this and move on in this spirit we will be back here again in 20 years time, hanging our heads in shame at what is wrong with the system.<\/p> <p>  The letters I have received from parents since I published the Bill three years ago are heartbreaking.  We see an 11 year old child in hospital with anorexia from being bullied at school by a relative of the principal, but nothing can be done about it by going to the board.  I could tell the committee story after story of heartache in the lives of real people.  The one voice that is missing from this room is that of the students.  They are not here today, which is telling in itself.  We must be very cognisant that the system we represent must bring forward the students' voice.<\/p> <p>  With regard to expanding the role of the Ombudsman for Children or whether we have a new ombudsman, I began this journey three years ago by publishing legislation to expand the role of the Ombudsman for Children to address educational issues.  At the time I was rebuffed by the same Ombudsman, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister of the day, who was a member of my party.  I was told the legislation would not fly and there was no need to expand the role of the Ombudsman for Children into educational matters, which was my specific objective.  Here we are, three years on, having come full circle and I am being told the solution to the problem is to expand the remit of the Ombudsman for Children, which is where I began three years ago.<\/p> <p>  This is not about right or wrong or about anybody having a monopoly on the right thing to do.  I was one of the first to quote the figure that almost half of complaints to the Ombudsman for Children relate to education.<\/p><p>Perhaps we could end all this and call it the education ombudsman as half the complaints to him are about education.  Maybe we could get over our hang-up with the title one way or the other.<\/p><p> I want to make a point on my Bill.  The legally binding powers aspect of it has been referred to by the Department and the Ombudsman for Children.  I made it quite clear on Second Stage that I have no difficulty with amending the legislation to remove the legally binding aspect of it.  I have no difficulty doing that and I want to put that on the record.  I am trying to get at educational welfare.  I have not seen it addressed in any of the submissions and I read every one of them before coming in here today.  People talk about the welfare of children but I am talking about the educational welfare of children.  There is a difference.  I became interested in that following a case submitted to the Ombudsman for Children where 39 students were put into junior and senior infants classes.  There should have been 24 in each class.  The principal wrote to the board of management to complain and asked if there should be a smaller number in junior or senior infants classes.  The board of management said that it was none of the principal's business and that it was the board of management.  Eventually a parent was forced to take it to the Ombudsman for Children.  I saw every letter from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children - there were numerous letters on this case - which it essentially said it had no remit.  I investigated it further.  There is an educational welfare issue where there are 39 students in a class.  It  is against the advice of the Department in that the smallest number of students should be in junior and senior infants.  There are 39 pupils in the class for no good reason but the Ombudsman for Children said he had no remit.  He has no remit because only their educational welfare is impacted.  They are not being beaten, starved or bullied.  Bullying is a grey area and I do not know if it is being addressed satisfactorily by the Ombudsman for Children.  Educational welfare is very different from other welfare and it is not being recognised or addressed.<\/p><p> Mr. Hanevy from the Department of Education and Skills gave a synopsis of the Bill.  We have had several conversations on it and I thank him for his engagement.  He made the point that if a parent had a grievance about the exclusion of a child from a school sports team, the parent could ask the ombudsman for education, if there was one, to exercise the power of direction to have the team's composition altered.  That is bordering on insulting because it is nonsensical and ridiculous.  The board of management is not responsible for the make-up of a school team.  I do not know of anywhere in the country where the board of management picks the team.  The team is picked by the teacher of sports on the day.  I am talking about decisions made by the board of management that should be appealed.  This is taking it a step too far and there is an over-emphasis on the legal side of it that we could all be tied up in courts for the rest of our lives.  I have accepted from the outset that I would be quite happy to remove that.<\/p><p> I have had discussions with Dr. Muldoon over a long time, including during his former role within the organisation.  One of the cases I read in his report was about a school had expelled a girl because she was pregnant.  A parent wrote to Dr. Muldoon and he carried out his investigation.  If my memory serves me correctly, he wrote to the school advising that it should admit the pregnant girl and had no grounds to expel her but from that day to this one, the letter was ignored.  That is my issue with this.  Even when Dr. Muldoon suggested something, he was ignored.  Some 95% or so of schools are good and are doing a wonderful job but when 5%, 2% or 1% are letting us down.  What are we going to do with them?  Children's livelihoods, education and well-being are all tied up in that.<\/p><p> I read Mr. Tyndall's submission with interest.  As I said to the Ombudsman for Children's office, he does not get the educational aspect of it.  He does not understand it.  He referred to 87 complaints about Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, or 82%.  They are about financial matters.  They are not educational complaints.  I do not see that as him addressing educational issues and educational welfare.  They are mathematical by nature and are related to accounting and somebody's income.  I am trying to make the point about the difference between educational welfare and financial welfare, general welfare and so on.  Mr. Tyndall mentioned access, finance and administration.  They are not really educational issues by nature.  If I was to ask Mr. Tyndall what he thinks of the ongoing teachers' dispute which is affecting only third years but will affect leaving certificate students shortly, which would come under his remit, what would he say?  I am not putting him on the spot, because I will not ask the question, but if I was to ask what he thinks of the teachers' refusal to correct their own children's work from an educational aspect and the protection of leaving certificate children, would he have a view on it?  I do not expect him to have one and am not asking that question.  That is the point I am trying to make.  An education ombudsman would be solely dedicated to educational issues.<\/p><p> On the proliferation of ombudsman offices, given the Grace case and Tuam Mother and Baby Home, I do not think we can have enough accountability.  Costs and delays were referred to.  One cannot put a price on a child's well-being or mental health, or the child who is in bed at 11 years of age with anorexia.  I cannot put a cost on that but if somebody has the expertise and interest to address the educational issues, I would not allow money to come in the way of that.  I have never been known for throwing money away either.<\/p><p> I thank Ms Dempsey for her forthright and honest comments.  They are welcome.  I thank her for her acknowledgement of my own comments.<\/p><p> The first time I saw the Irish Primary Principals' Network, IPPN, comment on it was in its magazine and I was touched by its concern for the national purse.  It is not a substantive reason to oppose it.  That was the first I saw of it.  It sees it as another layer.  I have no difficulty with the IPPN's opposition to it and understand that it represents principals who are people behind boards of management and may not want it opened up.  I would suggest it is not all but some of them.  I thank Ms Lynch for giving a balanced and welcome view on behalf of parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#H00300","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Daly.

I was committee-hopping today as committees are coinciding.  My colleague, Senator Fintan Warfield, was here to cover for me.  Deputy Carol Nolan is very much involved in the issue.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions in the previous D&aacute;il and Seanad, where we would have met with the Ombudsman on a regular basis.  One of the reports done by that committee was on looking at the power and the remit of the Ombudsman.  It made many recommendations about extending those.  It might be worth looking at that report in the context of this debate.  I appreciate the Bill is being brought forward in good faith.<\/p> <p>  From what I understand, a broader question has been alluded to in the debate which is that the power of the ombudsmen at the moment to do what they want to do, and should be able to do on behalf of the State, should be looked at.  They are quite hampered and that report will feed into this debate and show that there are mechanisms to extend the powers of the ombudsmen.  We need to ensure there is a mechanism available to anybody who has an issue with education to be able to bring it forward to one of the ombudsmen.  I am not 100% sure and I am happy to listen to the debate, which I welcome, as to whether we need a separate ombudsman.<\/p><p>At this stage I would not be sold on that debate, to be quite honest.  That is because there are certain areas that the children's ombudsman has been critical of, for example, including direct provision and children in that system who are trying to access third-level education.  Therefore we should also examine that report, as it would give us an insight into another facet of the debate.<\/p><p> This matter needs to be taken on board because it goes down to a core issue.  If a citizen wants to make a complaint it should be as easy as possible to do so.  It should be clear where a citizen must go to make a complaint.  We should also know that the person to whom the complaint is made has sufficient powers to deal with it and that the complainant can obtain redress.  In this scenario we need to clarify that pathway.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#J00700","speaker":"1377","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their presentations.

What is on offer regarding the parent and student charter is a phenomenal change of culture in the way forward for education.  We are putting children into the system for the first time.  It always irks me when I hear negotiations with the education partners that do not involve children.  Therefore we are putting a students' charter in place as well as for parents.  In turn, that means we are creating a new system of engagement with the authorities.  It will mean that parents should have a much more open and transparent engagement with schools.  In that way, principals will know that parents have an opportunity to engage with them on a more regular basis.<\/p> <p>  The charter will allow parents and children to highlight what they want from their school, and it will be the terms of reference for the school to work to.  It will also have a set of principles which are clear and concise, and which will refer to matters such as children's rights.  It will allow the child to be heard, which is an article of the UNCRC, as well as allowing the child's views to be listened to and followed up on.  In addition, it will allow the child not to be discriminated against.  This will not only concern students' councils, but will need to engage with all children across the board.  It will also have to encompass children with special needs, and education and welfare difficulties.  It is creating a whole new culture.<\/p> <p>  While there will be changes, the most important one is the ability to get a directive from the Minister.  That is what changes the concerns we had.  Deputy Daly cited the example of a pregnant teenager who is not allowed to go to school.  Even when the child was born, the mother was still not allowed to attend that school.  That could have been avoided if my office had the power to seek a ministerial directive.  It would probably have changed the way in which the principal dealt with us also because he would have known we had that option.  That is the greatest achievement coming from today's work and it is something to be proud of.  All the negotiations that have occurred so far change the way boards and principals have to look at things.<\/p> <p>  It is not something that will happen every day.  We are talking about a small number.  The psychological pressure on parents was mentioned, because essentially one comes to a dead end if boards do not listen to parents.  If they come to us and we cannot engage any further with them, that is a dead end.  That is what has been happening.  My ability to bring the Department of Education and Skills into it in a more realistic manner has changed as a result of this measure.<\/p> <p>  I want to counter what Deputy Jim Daly said.  It is unfair to characterise our office as not dealing with the educational welfare of children.  It is an unfair characterisation of our office to say that we only deal with bullying, child protection and beaten children.  There are clear examples to the contrary.  We have already highlighted the idea of educational welfare for children with special accommodation for the leaving and junior certificates.  We worked hard on that issue and created a report for the State Examinations Commission.  <\/p> <p>  We have also commissioned research on children in care in education and the welfare system they require.  We have examined designations that will be coming through the Education (Admissions) Bill soon.  That provides a designation for children who did not get access to school, as well as for special needs children.  We had a long engagement with the Department over those investigations out of which the designations have come.<\/p> <p>  We have also been involved in investigations concerning preschool children with special needs who could not get special needs assistants and were not able to access the free school year.  That has led to the new aims scheme that is now coming on board.  We therefore have a huge engagement with education and welfare, and our office does that all the time.  Some 45% of our work concerns the education remit.  <\/p> <p>  It was clearly stated that the idea of an education ombudsman is to be solely dedicated to educational welfare.  By its nature, however, one cannot engage with other aspects concerning children.  We do not need to silo children any further, we need to engage across the remit and we do that continually.  Every day of the week we deal with children who have problems getting school transport, as well as those with special needs, including occupational or speech and language therapy.<\/p> <p>  When we have child protection issues, that concerns Tusla, we engage across all Departments.  That allows us to see the whole child and not just the educational aspects.  To cement us into one more little silo is to the detriment of schools, parents and children.  That is the crucial part for us.  <\/p> <p>  It is important for the message to go out that the overall culture is changing and will allow us to examine the role of school boards and principals in order to do something about that.  We can certainly make improvements through the parent and student charter.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman said, this is a historical step forward from 1998 when section 28 was never even touched.  We have constantly asked for the tripod of complaints mechanism - the Teaching Council, section 28 and ourselves - to be in place.  We were working on our own for the past 20 years, but now have the Teaching Council and a brand new section 28 through the parent and student charter.  That will make a huge difference to those difficult cases that we all want to see being improved.<\/p> <p>  We want to take away the pain and psychological trauma, both for parents and children, when a board is stubborn, recalcitrant and does not go any further.  This represents a huge step forward. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Deputy Jim Daly was very eloquent in support of the principles he is seeking to have built into the ombudsman system and I have no quarrel with him in that regard.  It is clear that issues about educational welfare should be addressed in the context of an ombudsman's scheme.  My particular issue with it was whether that could be most quickly and effectively addressed by the extension of powers under and the remit of the existing scheme or whether it was necessary to create a new one.<\/p> <p>  The issue of recommendations being ignored is one that tends not to affect, as I said, ombudsmen working wholly within the public sector.  It is the particular role of schools and school boards which fall outside the power of direction that causes many of the difficulties the Deputy properly identified.  As I said, within the private sector it is normal for ombudsmen to have binding powers and for the organisations within their remit to have to comply with their recommendations, unless they take court action.  As the Deputy acknowledged, this potentially leads to many judicial reviews, which is not helpful.  The proposals to allow the Minister to make binding directions are an excellent compromise, one which balances the traditional ombudsman model and the quasi-independence or independence of boards of governors in a way that would ensure recommendations were not ignored.  As the Deputy stated, in all of these matters it is the small minority of cases in which problems arise that consistently provide the work for ombudsman schemes. <\/p> <p>  Although the Office of the Ombudsman deals with welfare issues, they tend to be student welfare issues within the further and higher education sector or, as Dr. Muldoon described, issues around access to support for leaving certificate students sitting examinations.  They are crucial and occupy a considerable amount of time for both offices.  The existence of both offices has led to major systemic change in the way this support is provided.  This shows the capacity of ombudsmen to take individual complaints and turn them into real and lasting change for a much larger number of people than come to our offices.<\/p> <p>  While I take the point that some of the work we do is about funding, I must also note that a significant educational welfare issue arises where a student is told midway through the second year of a degree course that his or her funding is about to be withdrawn and, what is more, that all funding received thus far must be repaid.  These matters have an impact. <\/p> <p>  The quickest and most effective way to realise the aspirations the Deputy set out for improvements in access to redress in schools would be to ensure the Ombudsman for Children, in particular, had the necessary changes to powers and resources to enable his office to deliver effective redress in the circumstances about which the Deputy is concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Deputy Jim Daly asked what we did about the 2% of schools.  Our purpose is not to take the offensive against all schools in the State system; we certainly do not portray a picture of principals running mini-cabals with boards of management.  However, the issue is one of deciding what to do about the 0.1%, 2%, 3% or 5% of schools where problems arise.  Some boards operate dysfunctional decision-making practices and some principals take issues very personally when a parent raises a difficulty in the provision of special educational needs support for a child or makes a complaint about one of a myriad of other issues in a school.  The issue arises when the complaint is compounded by not being addressed, despite the intervention of other agencies.<\/p> <p>  We know special educational needs organisers, SENOs, who will act as advocates on behalf of a parent and a child.  However, it is not within their remit to act in that capacity, yet they will try to act as mediators.  I am aware that there are proposals to include this in the remit of SENOs in the new inclusion support service.  SENOs do not have any say in the decision a school can make.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the cohort of people we represent, namely, parents of children with special needs, we interface with health and educational support services all the time, of which there is a severe lack.  A therapist may come to a school to enable it to deal with difficulties arising from a child's disability.  When this is not taken on board and a situation breaks down, it may lead to a breakdown of the school placement.  Despite the parent trying to act as an advocate on behalf of his or her child and work in a collaborative fashion with the school, the interpersonal relationship between the parent and the principal may break down.  When trying to navigate a solution, the parent may go through the official complaints procedure which leads to the board of a management which consistently sides with the principal.  We have even seen this happen in cases in which an accusation of assault was made against a member of staff or the principal.  These cases occurred prior to the Teaching Council being given the power to enforce disciplinary actions.  The 2% of schools with which we must deal are those where the board of management shuts down in the face of the problems I described.  I have personal experience of such cases.  Changing culture for the main school body may bring about a change for the 2% of schools where there may be peer pressure.  They may deal with matters in a certain way or perhaps the operation of the boards might need to be examined.<\/p> <p>  I have a list of telephone numbers which I give to parents who do not know how to navigate the system.  Some parents contact me to tell me they have been in touch with the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  I tell them to call the Irish Primary Principals Network and provide it with information on what is happening in the school in question.  Depending on who answers the telephone, the parent may be directed to a colleague who will offer advice.  In such cases the organisation is at least aware of what is happening in the 2% of schools, even though it is not within its capacity to sort out the issue.  We direct parents in the direction of the IPPN to ensure it notes that there is a problem in certain schools. <\/p> <p>  I note that the parent and student charter which would be more appropriately titled the student and parent charter proposes oversight mechanisms where required.  It does not appear that it will provide for the strong arm of the Minister in relation to all activities in schools.  It deals with the 2% of schools where there are no other avenues of redress for parents and children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>The parent charter was conceived more than five years ago.  The elements of the charter related to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children were included because Deputy Jim Daly, in conversation with the Minister, identified particular aspects of the current operation of the system that could be improved.  It was an attempt to make improvements.<\/p> <p>  The last thing I want is to be insulting.  The committee, possibly for the first time, asked the Department to provide a briefing on a Private Members' Bill, not just on its own, which is new and part of new politics and so on.  In attempting to do this faithfully the only point I was making was that the Bill did not provide for many exemptions.  For example, the terms and conditions of teachers are excluded from the legislation covering the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  This means that since there are no boundaries, everything in a school comes before an ombudsman who will be in a binding space or make absolute determinations.  The example I used - there is empathy in this - of the row about the composition of the school table was given because one of my colleagues in the office was telling me about the experience in a primary school outside Athlone where the principal's child was on the team when everyone knew ten other children were ahead of him. <\/p> <p>  Much of the debate is about what happens at the back end.<\/p><p>What we are really trying to do in the charter is change things at the front end.  That came from a piece of research a colleague did for a Master's degree about how public services are delivered.  If one listens to the people who experience the service wilfully and openly, one can solve many things because one knows what is bothering people and what are their problems.  One then minimises the stuff at the back end.  In the detail of charter, we see parent power as being very important.  In respect of the reporting that must be done within the guidelines, there will be template guidelines so that they are universal.  They will have to explain the complaints they received in any one year.  Anonymity would have to apply but the totality of the parent body would be able to see exactly what was dealt with in the course of the year.  The reputational damage schools can suffer if they do not operate properly under the charter, for example, if a school feels it is going to be damned in the local newspaper, can often be potent in bringing about change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Hanevy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>The role of a school principal is ultimately about the welfare of children.  It is about teaching and learning in a school community and we take it very seriously.  No school is perfect and we know that as an association because boards of management are not perfect.  They were introduced in 1975.  As an organisation, we feel that there is significant room for reform there, and I can empathise with the committee's frustration at times.  We make significant efforts to encourage the best possible practice.  When we talk about 2% or whatever the percentage of schools where there is a difficulty, we feel parents should be able to put their case to a formal body.  In fairness to the Ombudsman for Children's office, about which I recently wrote in our magazine and whose powers many of our colleagues were not aware of, it has dealt with over 3,000 complaints.  We have 4,000 schools.  One complaint related to special needs education where the parents were unhappy with the way the child was being resourced.  The Ombudsman for Children's office was not afraid to come in and slap down the school's board of management on the basis that the special educational needs policy was outdated.  It advised the school on a new policy.  Ultimately, the Ombudsman for Children's office approached it very well and the outcomes were good in the end.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jim Daly's Bill has much to commend it but we are not afraid of scrutiny.  We have the inspectorate, which is part of the DNA of schools.  We have educational welfare officers and the Teaching Council of Ireland and that is all good.  Ultimately, if we see another body doing the work the Ombudsman for Children's office can do, why introduce another layer?  By all means, everything that happens in a school should be scrutinised.  Ultimately, it is the relationship between the primary educators, who are the parents, and the school that drives on things.  Every school aspires to the best.  There are some good points in the Education (Amendment) Bill but we just do not like the way it will create another layer.  If the good parts are taken out of it and given to the Ombudsman for Children's office, we will be happy with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Ruddy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>One of the things about which we would be very cautious is that the parent-student charter and the Ombudsman for Children's office are not seen as the answer to all issues relating to school boards of management.  We will badly affect the powers of the office of the Ombudsman for Children and the parent-student charter if we try to use both of those mechanisms to fix all of the issues around school boards of management.  That is a separate piece of work that needs to be looked and I would caution against that.<\/p> <p>  I would happily endorse Dr. Muldoon's assertion that it should be the student-parent charter.  Parents would very much want the students at the forefront and centre of it and believe that it is their role to support them.  It has been outlined how the different layers can be difficult for parents.  Other colleagues of mine have recently been involved in looking at the child protection guidelines in schools and how they need to be revised in terms of Children First.  In respect of the interplay between the Department of Education and Skills, Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in trying to make sure all of those things are put in place at the same time, the fact that children's issues are separated out over so many Departments is utterly frustrating and certainly not in the best interests of protecting children.  It is really important that children's issues are kept in a cohesive way wherever we currently have them.  Trying to pull back in situations where Departments have already separated out children's issues can be very difficult, but to start separating things out when children are clearly under the remit of one ombudsman will lead to further frustration for parents in terms of how they can manage certain situations.  Children do not fit into nice packages so a complaint is rarely just an education issue.  It often touches other areas of the child's life so it would be very frustrating for parents if they were constantly being knocked from pillar to post within the complaints system at ombudsman level as well because they experience this quite a lot before they even get there.  I would caution against that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I thank members for all the very specific issues they have raised because it is very interesting for us to get that kind of information and to reflect on it.  We would say as an office that the Department of Education and Skills needs to reflect on how boards of management need to improve in terms of best practice.  That is something with which we would agree.  The IPPN and other organisations would also agree with that.  We are not a panacea for all ills.  In terms of oversight relating to how schools deal with grievances, the Ombudsman for Children's office thinks that the parent-student charter has significant potential.  This is the first building block.  As Mr. Hanevey said, when schools have to be more open and transparent in respect of complaints and how they are dealt with, that information is there.  Oversight mechanisms within the Department can be further developed and improved.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the role of our office, we have a broad remit.  In respect of educational welfare, we have an amazing power under our Act, particularly section 7, where we not only look at the investigation of complaints, but at the rights and welfare of the child under section 7.  We work cross-functionally as a team so that where systemic issues arise that cannot be addressed in respect of the admissibility of a complaint or where a complaint may not meet the threshold of what is required to investigate, we do not just drop these issues.  We take them on board.  There are massive problems with regard to special educational needs because the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act has not been implemented.  There is a right to an assessment but no right to what comes out of that assessment.  These are often issues where, with the best will in the world and following through on an investigation, we still end up with a road block so it is just not about schools.  There is a range of issues where our office is in a position to advise about how the rights and welfare of children can be improved.  We are learning all the time as an office.<\/p> <p>  I draw attention to the nuances within what is proposed in subsection 16 because what has been drafted by the Department not only relates to recommendations for our office where the complaint has met the threshold for investigation and has gone forward, but it also applies to the large amount of work our office does at the local resolution phase.  What is fantastic about the charter is that it is fully reflective of the way our office works and what we want to build upon, which is improving how schools operate at a local level, transparency, accountability and all the frustrations about communicating with parents shutting down.  They are issues that the principles of the charter address.  This is what we want to see changing.<\/p> <p>  In respect of suggestions and guidance, the wording of what is proposed is so important because it is not only talking about where an investigation has been conducted, but there are options to lay a report before the Oireachtas.  There have been a small number of situations where that has not been possible because we were protecting a child.  It also applies to the local resolution phase where a complaint has not met the threshold for investigation because of the criteria relating to the Act but where it is a serious issue.  The office works very hard to make suggestions, give encouragement and make recommendations to a school.<\/p><p>It is true that sometimes there are situations where boards do not carry through on that.<\/p><p> This legislation provides an additional stick where we can say there is another power and they should listen to what we are saying.  I would highlight that in Section 7 of the Act there is a provision around best practice guidance for schools in regard to the rights and welfare of the child.  We are about to publish a golden rules and complaints handling procedure, which the office was working on prior to the current proposals and which places the child at the centre of all of this.  There is excellent research on child-friendly complaints mechanisms.  We will have that as a resource for schools.  We would say that the Department of Education needs to present what is best practice for schools.  The parent and student charter is the way forward to improve all of that but it is a process and it is going to take time, it will not change everything overnight.  We as an office intend to work with that.<\/p><p> On educational welfare, the amendments will allow the educational charter to fall under the remit of our office.  That would broaden what is covered by maladministration.  We will look at how schools are implementing the charter.  That is a space we have not quite figured out yet but that will broaden what we are looking at.  It will still mean that we are not getting involved in adjudicating in the nitty-gritty of everything that goes on in the school, nor should we because that would not be best practice and it would not be practical.  However, we do think these proposals have huge potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n Webb","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>We came from a conference this morning on the role of the principal and looking at the importance of principals spending more time on the actual business of teaching and learning.

We as a society owe a great deal to the parents who serve on boards of management.  Without them we would be in a much weaker position.  When my children were going to school it was very difficult to get parents to go on boards of management and I am interested if it has become any easier in the period since then.  I am aware of difficulties in a local rural area where there were problems.  Sometimes, for members of boards of management, where issues are not resolved to a satisfactory level for those involved, there can be a historic aspect that goes on in the community where people can be divided, sometimes for a very long time thereafter.  That is very unfortunate.  It is not for today, but maybe a discussion on boards of management like Ms Dempsey mentioned, would be very worthwhile and is something that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I am heartened by the charter.  I am happy about Dr Muldoon's contribution and that in the future the Minister will be able to make a binding decision in regard to any issue.

Then there will be individual charters by school, because obviously there cannot be a one-size fits all as there is huge variation in the make-up of school communities.  How will the consultation with parents and students in the individual schools work?  In the more disadvantaged areas it can be impossible to get a parent to turn up to a parent-teacher meeting.  If it is a student council, often it is the most vulnerable, most needy child that does not put themselves up for election, so how will their voice be heard in that context?<\/p> <p>  I refer to Mr. Cotrell's remarks.  Will it be the principal who will drive the individual charter in the school, as secretary to the board of management?  I wholeheartedly agree that principals and senior management, due to the moratorium, are under serious work over-load.  I am aware of a principal in a DEIS school who works as the principal, the assistant principal - which in this case is the year-head where there are huge pastoral care issues because it is a DEIS school - and is also now the student council  teacher because they cannot get the B post replaced.

My response to that viewpoint, is that there is a Department and a Minister with responsibility for Education and Skills and a Department and Minister with responsibility for Health.  That is the way we organise our administration.  It would not be the worst idea to have an ombudsman, who would be independent, to have oversight of a Department of Education and Skills with a budget of &euro;8 billion.<\/p><p> I would like to hear the officials comment on educational welfare.  I see evidence of the acknowledgement of educational welfare along with physical, spiritual and emotional welfare.  Ultimately I am trying to achieve recognition of educational welfare.  I have tabled a parliamentary question on the number of complaints from schools on an annual basis.  Many parents would not know about the role of the Ombudsman for Children and would not think to make a complaint about a problem in school to the Ombudsman.  I would appreciate if the witnesses would provide the committee with the figures for the number of complaints.<\/p><p> I accept the Primary Principals Network, IPPN, has a contention about another layer of administration, in addition to the Teaching Council and the National Education Welfare Board.  I understand there is no layer dealing with boards of management and I accept if the Minister can take responsibility for boards of management through the Ombudsman for Children, we are bridging that gap.  To broaden the focus of the role of an ombudsman for education, it would not be just about complaints and grievances, it is only because I respect the work of both Mr. Peter Tyndall, Ombudsman and Information Commissioner and Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children and their respective offices, that I have such high regard and a strong desire to see an ombudsman specifically dedicated to education.  It is not a negative reflection on their offices.<\/p><p> I see the role of an ombudsman as being far greater than dealing with grievances.  The crucial role of an ombudsman is to lobby and to hold Government to account and to write reports on aspects of failings in the system and putting it up to Government to come forward.  School principals have an extraordinary workload.  I was a school principal and it was the most thankless job I ever did.  The job I am doing now is not hugely rewarding but I would never be a teaching principal.  I would not recommend being one in its current format.  I would like to see an education ombudsman who would be responsible solely for issues of education tackling that kind of issue.  It needs to be highlighted for Government that what is expected of teaching principals is grossly irresponsible.  I would see an ombudsman as a strength in dealing with this and other such issues.  The need for an ombudsman for education is a debate for another day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#N01100","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Daly.

We strayed, rightfully, into the issue of boards of management, their composition and how they are structured at present.  There is definitely work to be done in that area.  The boards of management of the 3,200  primary schools changed in the past year.  The model for the composition of boards has been in place since 1998, but an issue that was raised as a possible change when the Department was working with the partners this year was changing the role of the school principal from being a voting member of the board to attending the board.  That would mean the board could make its decisions without the principal being present.  That is good governance in most places.  The only partner that supported the Department in the working group was the National Parents Council Primary.  All the other partners, unions, the IPPN and the management bodies were not having it.  That is not to say we will not continue to persevere for it.  There is an issue about how the boards of small schools are serviced and how they can be serviced.  Even the IPPN has done work in the past about the division of the governance.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the charter, we are working with our partners on the child protection area at present because we know the safeguarding statements that will have to be provided when the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs commences the Children First legislation.  We will be creating a template.  There will be a great many common requirements in the charter, in terms of information for parents, the type of complaints procedure and how you engage people.  We will have a standard part but equally I take the Deputy's point about the disadvantaged.  We are quite seized about how the charter may have to be tapered.  The beauty of guidelines as distinct from regulations is that one can more readily taper the components to the needs of a special school for example.<\/p> <p>  There will be a lot of spoon-feeding because we want these things done.  I hear Mr. Se&aacute;n Cottrell's point.  Certainly, if the Oireachtas enacts this legislation, when we lead the work with the partners to take the flesh that is in the principles it and create the living charter, schools will be following that template.  I do not want to see that as bureaucracy, I want to see the purpose, which is a changed attitude.  I do see where there is extra work in simply asking people how they feel the school is going, inviting feedback in a simple questionnaire or simply at the end of the day setting out the number and type of complaints so that the entire parent body gets that type of information.  In the primary schools where the pupils must do 183 days, one time the Department used to police that, and we would receive letters that a school only did 180 days because a boiler burst.  That is a simple piece of information that should be included when the school reports to its parents at the end of the year.  How many of the 183 days did it make and, when it did not meet the 183 school days, to report the reason.  I do not see why anybody should be afraid to report that to the parent body.  There are charges that I do not think will involve extra work, but will be a change of mindset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017030700002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Hanevy"},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hanvey.

I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the overview of the operations of the national lottery.  The national lottery is an area of huge importance to the retail agents I represent.  It is also a key issue for this House as the national lottery is different from ordinary gaming in that it is operated under a State licence and was established to generate money for good causes.<\/p> <p>  The independent community retailers that RGDATA represent have played a key role in the success of the national lottery since it was first launched in 1988.  We certainly believe that our model of responsible retailing in the community assisted the national lottery to establish itself and develop into a well-regarded institution that attracted a significant price tag when the Government put a 20-year licence to operate the national lottery up for sale.<\/p> <p>  In general our members' relations with Premier Lotteries Ireland, PLI, the new operators of the national lottery have been positive and constructive.  While there were some initial transitional issues as PLI took over the national lottery franchise, thankfully the sort of technical issues which led to outages and the cancellation of a national lottery draw in 2015 have diminished.  PLI has also shown itself to be proactive in managing its relations with the national lottery agents and we welcome that.<\/p> <p>  As can be expected, PLI, as a commercial company that made a significant investment in the national lottery, will take whatever steps are necessary to build and grow its business in Ireland.  Retailers welcome any efforts to increase the retail sale of national lottery products, the prizes and the money raised for good causes and will continue to be responsible retailers within their local communities.  PLI can be expected to maximise the opportunities to grow its business operations here and to secure a return on the &euro;405 million it paid for the 20-year operating licence for the national lottery.  This is a fair and legitimate aspiration on its part, which should yield greater sales, more prizes and greater returns to good causes.  Of course PLI will do what it can to get a return on its business investment.  As the company itself states, \"PLI's mission is to operate a world class lottery for the people of Ireland, raising important funds for good causes, on behalf of the Irish Government\".<\/p> <p>  It was recognised at the time of the sale that it would be important to have an independent body overseeing the operation of the national lottery, protecting players' interests, the common good and ensuring the lottery was run in accordance with the licence.  Hence, the new licensing structure for the national lottery also saw the establishment of the first national lottery regulator in Ireland in 2014.  While the new regulator has needed time to establish and to start to build up expertise and knowledge we think that three years down the road the committee should review the role and function of the national lottery regulator.<\/p> <p>  From an RGDATA perspective and as significant stakeholders, there are some specific areas where we believe the national lottery regulator needs to become more public, find its voice and make its priorities and activities better known to the wider public.  I am not sure what the experience of this committee has been but, to date, RGDATA has heard very little from the regulator since the office was established and we would encourage a more open and active profile for this important role.<\/p> <p>  Let me give some examples of how the national lottery regulator plays a pivotal role.  The first area relates to technical issues.  In 2015 there was a significant technical issue concerning the national lottery which led to a draw being postponed for the first time in the history of the national lottery.  There were also some additional technical outages and incidents since then.  The technical integrity of the national lottery is of primary importance for players and retailers.  To date, no independent and authoritative explanation has been provided for the outages.  Retailers believe the regulator should be active in securing explanations for when the system fails and providing stakeholders with details of the problems and the measures taken to ensure they do not recur.<\/p> <p>  It is also important that the regulator regularly audits the technical performance of the national lottery and reports this information fully.  The growth in online gaming is another area where we believe the regulator needs to step up to the plate and demonstrate that the office is protecting the interests of players, the national lottery and the broader community.  At present there are 21 different instant games that can be played online on the national lottery website in addition to the national lottery and EuroMillions draws.  Players registered with the national lottery online are subject to spending limits of &euro;75 per day, &euro;300 per week and &euro;900 per month.  While most of the online games are replicas of the instant win or draws available in retail outlets, there are two that are entirely new and present an exclusive online playing opportunity, namely, Instant Lotto and Mini Keno.  The online games can be played on mobile devices any time, any place and anywhere so they raise issues for those disposed to gaming addiction that are less likely to arise in a traditional retail agent transaction.<\/p> <p>  The national lottery regulator should outline the measures that have been taken to protect vulnerable players and to replicate the types of controls on purchases in traditional shops.  It would also be helpful to get some data from the regulator on the profile and patterns of online purchases of national lottery products.  The impact of the rapid roll-out of online lottery products must be assessed independently and objectively.<\/p> <p>  We would also like to know if the national lottery regulator is monitoring the huge growth in online lotto sites with no links to the actual licensed national lotteries.<\/p><p>They offer punters the opportunity to gamble on the results of lotteries all around the world.<\/p><p> These sites have no obligations to contribute towards good causes.  All one has to do is google \"Play Lotto Online\" and one will get 16.5 million hits in less than one third of a second.  This has huge implications for how people play national lotteries and I make no bones about the fact that they are a huge threat to the retail agents I represent who are selling legitimate tickets that deliver funds to good causes.  The UK has proposed new legislation to make it a requirement for any gambling site wishing to advertise its services within the UK and accept UK customers to hold a licence issued directly by the UK Gambling Commission rather than the current position whereby the sites can operate with licences issued by a whitelisted gambling jurisdiction.  RGDATA respectfully suggests that the committee should investigate if we should do something similar here.<\/p><p> The growth in agents is another area I would like to touch on.  The national lottery intends to create a national lottery everywhere model, which will increase the opportunities for the public to buy lottery tickets in a host of new outlets and at new opportunities.  This will be achieved in part through deals with online payment services operators that have configured their devices to print out lottery tickets.  This will lead to a rapid explosion in the availability of the national lottery - a national lottery everywhere model with the lotto potentially being available in bookshops, cafes, restaurants, barbers - basically any outlet that has a point of sale terminal.  Has the regulator assessed the impact of such an extension of the availability of the national lottery?  How has he equated it with the licence condition for the operator of the lottery not to apply different commission structures to retail agents?<\/p><p> I refer to the national lottery and licensed premises.  It was a condition of the national lottery licence that no agents would be appointed in licensed premises where alcohol is sold for consumption on the premises.  This recognises two issues - first, the national lottery is different to ordinary gaming; it is operated under a State licence and aims to generate money for good causes.  It also recognises the risk of associating gaming with alcohol.  The irony is that the growth in online national lottery activity has effectively rendered the prohibition on sales of tickets in licensed outlets to be a fiction.  Players can now log onto their phones and play any one of 21 instant games in the pub subject only to the daily spending limit.  Has the regulator a view on this issue?  What research has his office carried out on the patterns of use and implications of such gaming?<\/p><p> It is important that the national lottery regulator increases its public profile and engagement with stakeholders in respect of the important role that the Oireachtas has conferred on it.  The regulator needs to demonstrate effectiveness in promoting the protection of the public interest in its operations and formal engagement by the regulator with the committee will be a key part of providing clarity on the regulator&rsquo;s role and function.  Ideally, the regulator should use its website and other media fora to provide details of reports on any technical outages involving the national lottery; measures taken by it to protect player interests; the extent to which it has approved or rejected new games submitted by approval by PLI; the research that it has undertaken on gaming patterns and habits in Ireland and how these feed into the regulatory function; the types of approvals sought for new agents to be appointed; details of any gaps in the regulatory protection for the public necessitated since the agency was set up; details of how it expends resources; and details of consumer complaints made and resolved concerning the national lottery.<\/p><p> RGDATA fully accepts that the regulator has a new brief and seems not to have had a significant level of expertise within his office from people formerly involved in regulating lotteries.  There has, therefore, been a steep learning curve.  At the same time, PLI has ramped up considerably its expansion of the national lottery and its plans to become a &euro;1 billion business and it is important that all stakeholders, including the public and retail agents, are confident that an active regulator is on the job.  I thank the committee and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488902400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Has RGDATA had direct engagement with the regulator?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030700002#D00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488902400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>When the regulator was appointed, we met him and we attended a previous meeting of the committee at which he was also present.

At the outset, and to put my presentation in context, I consider it useful to set out the respective roles of the operator and the regulator, which are set out in the national lottery Act 2013, and the licence to operate the national lottery.  Under the Act, the operator has \"the sole purpose of operating the National Lottery in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licence\".  The operator must report to the regulator on its activities and it must appear before this committee when requested to do so.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform awarded a 20-year licence to the operator, Premier Lotteries Ireland, PLI, on 27 February 2014 and PLI began operating the national lottery on 30 November 2014.<\/p> <p>  I was appointed as the first regulator from 17 November 2014.  Prior to that, the Minister acted as regulator.  Since establishment, we have put in place an expert team to regulate the market.  Our team includes regulatory, risk management, audit, accountancy, psychology and legal expertise.  I am an actuary with more than 25 years experience working in regulatory areas in the private and public sectors.  I am joined today by the deputy regulator and head of audit and finance, Mr. Derek Donohoe, who is a former partner in a leading Irish accountancy practice with significant experience of auditing, forensic accounting, corporate governance and compliance.<\/p> <p>  The functions of the regulator under the Act are to procure the holding of the national lottery; to monitor and enforce compliance by the operator with the Act and the licence; to exercise enforcement rights of any trade mark of the national lottery; to consider for approval certain matters relating to the national lottery, including schemes for national lottery games; and to manage and control the national lottery fund.<\/p> <p>  In carrying out these functions, the regulator&rsquo;s objectives are probity, participant protection, sustainability and, subject to the foregoing, maximising returns for good causes.  Accordingly, the regulator monitors and enforces compliance by the operator with the Act and the licence and considers - and approves or declines to approve - proposals relating to certain matters received from the operator.  Where an operational matter does not require approval and does not breach a term of the Act or the licence, this is a matter for the operator.  I hope the committee will understand that, in my presentation, we may at times only be able to speak in general terms.  This is because, like other regulators, our role requires that we respect commercially sensitive and confidential information.<\/p> <p>  In relation to compliance by the operator with the requirements of the Act and the licence, the regulator continuously monitors the activities of the operator.<\/p><p>Such monitoring includes oversight of data and systems of the operator.  This is real-time access and includes, for example, monitoring sales and cash flows.  It also includes oversight of the independent control system, which duplicates the activities of the operator's business system and provides an important verification tool.  We carry out reviews of the operator's processes and controls.  For example, we have conducted reviews of the operator's processes for risk management, anti-fraud, prizes management and fitness and probity.  We have reviews of specific matters, such as technology outages.  We receive and review of regular reports from the operator, including management reports, reports on IT performance and trading reports.  We monitor those.  We review arrangements for and the output of the operator's internal and external audits.  An area on which we are very focused is the ongoing review of online play, including the controls set out in the licence, but also play activity.  We get data on this from the operator regularly.<\/p><p> Our oversight informs our considerations when proposals put to us by the operator are being assessed for approval.  In doing this work, we have overseen enhancements in a number of areas, including risk management, internal audit, governance of information and communication technology and controls for online play.  <\/p><p> With regard to proposals from the operator, we consider requests for approval of certain matters, which, under the Act and the licence, require the approval of the regulator.  Such matters include codes of practice for advertising and promotion, sales, participant relations and employee vetting, in addition to proposals relating to schemes for lottery games and third party providers.  <\/p><p> In total, the operator has submitted 69 requests for approval.  These were considered in accordance with the Act and the licence, and on 60 of the occasions further information was sought by the regulator or the operator chose to submit amended requests for approval, or both.  Ultimately, 59 submissions received from the operator have been approved.  <\/p><p> A key function of the regulator is to manage and control the national lottery fund.  We review weekly detailed financial reports and receive and disburse funds as provided for in the licence.  Under the licence, the amount allocated to good causes is equal to 65% of the difference between total net sales and the amount in respect of prizes.  In 2016, &euro;218.9 million was transferred for good causes, &euro;7 million of which related to sales in previous years.  In 2015, &euro;193.3 million was transferred in respect of good causes.<\/p><p> Reports we have received from the operator in respect of 2016 include the following in regard to the operation of the national lottery.  In 2016, 1.4 million people played lottery games on a regular basis, representing more than 40% of the adult population, and almost 70% of the adult population played the game occasionally.<\/p><p> Ticket sales for 2016 amounted to &euro;750 million.   The figure for 2015 was &euro;670 million.  Sales for draw-based games amounted to &euro;530 million, while scratch card and online instant-win games generated &euro;220 million.  With respect to the sales channel, which includes sales for draw-based games and instant games, 95% of sales were retail, while 5% were online.  <\/p><p> With regard to the retail estate, the number of retail outlets increased by approximately 1,500 to 5,200 since the commencement of operations under the licence.  Around half of the increase relates to the availability of lottery games being extended from approximately one third of post offices to all post offices, including all sub-post offices.  It is noted that most of the increased retail estate provides a restricted service in terms of the range of games and the options available.

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Elaine Breslin, the clinical assessment manager.  Further to our statement to the committee on 24 November 2016, we are pleased to discuss the HPRA report, Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review, which was submitted to the Minister for Health on 31 January and subsequently published by the Minister on 10 February.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the Minster asked the HPRA in November last year to provide scientific advice on the use of cannabis for medical purposes.  We were also requested to review the situation regarding the medical use of cannabis in other countries.  The role of the HPRA includes the evaluation of the benefits and risks of medicines on the basis of scientific evidence, prior to granting a marketing authorisation.  The evidence for the use of many cannabis products is insufficient to permit a conventional benefit-risk evaluation, or authorisation as medicines.  As such, we have concluded as an outcome of our review that we cannot recommend widespread access to cannabis for the treatment of a range of medical conditions.  However, we have advised that access could be facilitated under appropriately controlled circumstances where adequate assurance of patient safety and follow-up can be provided.<\/p> <p>  Since the publication of the report, a policy decision has been made by the Minister to provide access to cannabis for medical purposes for defined medical conditions.  He has indicated his intention to proceed with the advice of the HPRA.  In conducting our review of the medical use of cannabis, the HPRA convened an expert working group comprising relevant clinical experts and patient representatives.  The working group provided valuable support and context through the sharing of insights from both patient and clinical perspectives on this issue.  The conclusions of the review are comprehensively outlined within the published report which has been circulated to the committee with my opening statement.  I would like to outline the key considerations for today's discussion.<\/p> <p>  To date, there is an absence of scientific data demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of cannabis products.  A point of importance is that there is insufficient information on the treatment of long-term medical conditions, such as those for which there is a public focus.  Most cannabis products available under international access schemes do not meet pharmaceutical quality requirements for medicines.<\/p> <p>  The review highlighted significant gaps between the public perception of effectiveness and safety, and the regulatory requirement for scientific data, which is mandatory to determine the role of cannabis as a medicine.  Any proposal to circumvent the medicines regulatory system, established by law, would require careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences and lower standards of patient protection.<\/p> <p>  The best outcome for patients is the development of authorised, or those capable of being authorised, cannabis-based medicines where the safety, effectiveness and quality can be assured, and understood by the patient and health care professionals.<\/p><p>In this way, doctors can take account of side effects and interactions with other medicines, and patients have medical oversight for their cannabis treatment.<\/p><p> If cannabis products that are not capable of being authorised as medicines, are made available through an access programme, patients and health care professionals will need to be conscious of the limitations of the programme in assuring the safety, quality and effectiveness, as compared with what would be expected for an authorised medicine.<\/p><p> Access to cannabis for medical use should recognise patient need, be evidence-based, and fit with clinical practice.  Therefore, it is advised that treatment with cannabis is only permitted under a controlled access programme for the treatment of patients with: a. spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies and interventions while under expert medical supervision; b. intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes whilst under medical supervision; and, c. severe refractory, which is treatment-resistant, epilepsy that has failed to respond to anti-convulsant medications while under medical supervision.<\/p><p> In respect of the possible use of cannabis for the three specified medical conditions, the HPRA has not only reviewed the scientific literature, but has also advised on the practical steps that could be taken to provide access for Irish patients.<\/p><p> To this end, we recommend the introduction of a monitored five-year cannabis access programme.  Such a programme is necessary both to maximise the safe and effective use of cannabis as a medical therapy for an individual patient and to minimise the potential negative impact of wider access on society. <\/p><p> It is proposed that the programme should run for a period of five years with a centralised data collection point and regular reports to the Department of Health.  This information will provide data on the medical use of cannabis and the supply needs in Ireland.  The programme will also provide an appropriate level of monitoring and accountability for the cannabis products supplied.<\/p><p> Specific elements of the access programme should include the following: Patients treated with cannabis should be under the care of a medical consultant who has expertise and experience in the treatment of the specified condition, and who is responsible for the monitoring and follow-up of the patient; authorised cannabis-based medicines should be considered for treatment in the first instance.  This includes medicines not authorised in Ireland but approved for use in other countries.  Investigational cannabis-based products subject to appropriate quality control requirements, could be sourced and used in the treatment programme when standard treatments have been unsuccessful and alternatives are not available in Ireland; doctors, pharmacists and patients should be registered under the programme, and data collected on the use of cannabis in these patients; patients should be educated on the correct use of the cannabis for medical purposes, the benefits and risks involved, how to report side-effects, and the care and safe disposal of cannabis products; and, doctors and pharmacists should be supported to facilitate prescribing and dispensing.<\/p><p> This proposal for a cannabis access programme provides a strong framework that can inform the future direction of access to cannabis for medical purposes.  Further scientific research will be key to determining that future direction.  While there is significant involvement of scientific researchers in Ireland, more clinical, human-based research is needed.  We envisage that this access programme can be adjusted and widened as clinical experience and scientific knowledge develops, and as more cannabis-based medicines become available. <\/p><p> The HPRA is committed to assisting access to cannabis for medical use, in so far as we can, within the context of our remit.  The implementation of the access programme would be a significant move for Ireland, as we align ourselves with a number of our European neighbours.  In the course of the HPRA review, 40 countries were surveyed.  In Europe, 16 countries do not have any access programmes, nine have programmes for exceptional use similar to that advised by the HPRA, and three countries have wider access programmes.<\/p><p> I have previously highlighted that the proposals in the report were accepted by the Minister, who has committed to progress the implementation as a priority.  There are a number of factors that will be required including legislation, support for patients and health care professionals, and identification of suitable quality-controlled cannabis products.<\/p><p> A new legal framework for cannabis for medical use will require time to develop, and needs to be done in a manner that is effective and best meets both patient and societal needs.  There is already provision within the existing legislation for prescribing in limited circumstances, subject to a licence from the Minister.<\/p><p>Supporting patients and health care professionals is vital to its implementation.  To that end, the HPRA understands the Department of Health will consult relevant stakeholders.  As part of its review, the HPRA has identified potential product sources and further work is under way.<\/p><p> Since publication of the report, the HPRA has met patient representatives, Deputies and their advisers and responded to queries from members of the public and the media.  We consider it important that patients and health care professionals have access to the information we can provide on medicines and the background to the HPRA&rsquo;s proposals.  In addition, we are committed to continuing to engage with the Department of Health to achieve effective and timely implementation of the proposals.<\/p><p> The HPRA advises that cannabis for medical use should only be initiated as part of a structured process of formal ongoing clinical evaluation of patients with clearly defined medical conditions.  This position is based on current scientific evidence and will be kept under review.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for giving us this opportunity to make a presentation to the committee.  We will be happy to address follow-up questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorraine Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Nolan.

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Marie Egan, a pharmacist in the medicines and controlled drugs unit; Dr. John Devlin, deputy chief medical officer; and Dr. Ronan Glynn, specialist registrar in public health medicine.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee will know that cannabis is a Schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act and the most widely used illegal drug in Ireland.  It is worth remembering that it is not currently an authorised medicine and has not gone through the normal regulatory procedures for medicines which are designed to protect patients and ensure treatments are supported by good evidence of their effectiveness and safety.  However, the Department is aware that some patients believe cannabis should be a treatment option for their medical condition.  It is also aware that a number of countries have changed the law or introduced programmes to allow access, under strict conditions, for certain groups of patients.<\/p> <p>  Against this background, on 3 November 2016 the Minister for Health announced a review of policy on cannabis for medical use.  He requested the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, to provide him with expert advice.  On 10 February he published the HPRA&rsquo;s report, Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review, and announced that he would establish an access programme for standardised cannabis-based treatments for the following conditions: spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, resistant to all standard therapies and interventions; intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes; and severe, refractory treatment resistant epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anticonvulsant medications.  The Minister has thanked the HPRA and the members of the expert review group for their work on the report which he has described as a milestone in the development of policy on medicinal cannabis.<\/p> <p>  Patients accessing cannabis under the programme will be required to be under the care of a medical consultant.  Officials will consult stakeholders on how the access programme will operate.  It will be important to engage with the clinical community in the development of a framework to operationalise the access programme for the implementation of medicinal cannabis in health care.  Officials are also examining legislative changes that will be required to underpin the access programme.<\/p> <p>  The Minister intends to progress the establishment of the access programme as a priority.  However, to be clear, patients accessing cannabis under the cannabis access programme will need to be recommended for cannabis treatment by a relevant medical consultant involved in their care.  This recognises the relevance of such treatment in the overall care planning and management of the underlying medical condition.<\/p> <p>  For the period during which the access programme is being established, it remains open to the Minister to grant a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Act for access to cannabis for medical purposes in individual cases.  Such applications will be considered on a case by case basis.  The granting of a licence must, however, be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for giving us the opportunity to make a presentation to the committee.

I would welcome some information on that.  It happens regularly enough that a doctor prescribes an unlicensed medicine in this country.  In my job I am aware that unlicensed medicines, usually ones which are licensed in other countries, are prescribed.  There is no reason they are not licensed here but it is more an issue concerning paperwork.  One could ask what that would leave us open to in this country if we were to circumvent the licensing.  In other countries are such products always made available on foot of a consultant's prescription?  If a consultant or regular GP prescribes a product off-licence, where does the liability lie?  My understanding is that if a doctor prescribes something in Ireland off-licence, he or she is solely liable for the effects of the medicines, and takes it upon himself or herself professionally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#E00500","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":714,"content":"<p>The HPRA is now saying that we should look at establishing an access programme for three specified medical conditions.

It was also said that a new legal framework would be needed in order to establish the access programme.  On page 32 of the report there is reference to the 1961 UN convention on narcotic drugs, to which Ireland is a party.  It says that under the convention the production and distribution of controlled substances must be licensed and supervised and the rationale for that is outlined.

There is a lot of emotive debate around this topic.  A woman from Cork is coming to the D&aacute;il today, and it is important that we acknowledge the work and effort she has put into campaigning on this particular issue.  However, just because people are campaigning does not mean that what is being sought can be provided by political decisions.<\/p> <p>  We are discussing the health implications of individuals and, more broadly, society in the context of making cannabinoid oils with THC available through an access programme at some stage.  That will require a lot of monitoring, evaluation and correlation of medical and scientific data over the next number of years.<\/p> <p>  In the context of what is being discussed, and given the backdrop of Vera Twomey arriving in the D&aacute;il in the next hour or so, there has been a lot of confusion about the use of cannabinoid oils with THC.  Parliamentary questions were been tabled and there was a perception that a registered doctor could prescribe oils with THC in them.  Reference has been made to a number of parliamentary questions asked last October, replies to which stated an application could be made for a licence if a registered doctor made an application.  However, it was not made clear that a consultant paediatric neurologist had to make such applications.<\/p> <p>  I can understand the need to ensure there is proper scrutiny in the prescribing of drugs.  There should also be proper scrutiny of D&aacute;il questions and replies to ensure that they are accurate and do not mislead people, in particular in sensitive matters.  For a long period of time, the parliamentary questions gave a family hope they could access something they believed could change the life of their daughter but were subsequently refused on the grounds that a paediatric neurologist was not prescribing the drug.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the access programme.  How far has the European Medicines Agency gone in terms of examining the issue?  What other countries are making cannabinoid oils with THC available to patients under various licensing systems?  Are some countries more proactive than others?  Is there a lot of resistance in other countries?  I ask the witnesses to expand on the international comparators, primarily within the European Union, North America and Australia.  Did the witnesses consider that when compiling the report, for which I compliment them on bringing forward expeditiously?  It highlights issues such as spasticity, nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and epilepsy.  Why were those three areas highlighted in the report?  Was it because there is a body of research available or are the witnesses saying that other medicines may not work?  Are they suggesting that because they do not work something else should be tried?  Is there a strong body of international evidence to show that there is an improvement in outcomes in the three areas mentioned?<\/p> <p>  How many people have applied for licences in Ireland?

She asked whether a medical consultant was required in the context of the access scheme we are proposing.  One of the conditions we have set out is that the patient should be under the supervision of a specialist medical consultant.  The conditions for treatment would include severe epilepsy, cancer and multiple sclerosis.  All patients treated in those cases would be under the care of a specialist consultant.  They would also be under the control of a general practitioner &ndash; I wish to make that point straight and upfront.<\/p> <p>  The reason we have outlined the need for specialist medical consultant oversight relates to the fact that one of the requirements of the access programme is to ensure that all the conventional forms for treatment have been tried.  There is a view that specialist knowledge is required to ascertain whether that is the case.  We are taking about cannabis being used in addition to an established treatment programme for a patient.  Specialist medical oversight is important to monitor the effects of cannabis on the patient and how the effects might interact with the current medical regime of the patient.  We really believe this approach will bring about the best outcome for patients and that is what we have recommended.  In other words, the patient needs to be under the supervision of a medical consultant as well.  We have not necessarily said that the consultant has to prescribe.  It is a question of monitoring the effects of cannabis on the patient in view of the complexity of the issues that I have outlined.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to medical prescriptions in other countries.  There are several variations in the approaches taken in other countries.  It is generally the case that the medical prescriber is required to be a specialist and have specific training.  That is generally the case throughout the European system and also in the international context.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the access programme and whether cannabis would be authorised.  We need to be clear that this is not an authorisation of cannabis as a medicine that we would conventionally view as being an authorisation of a medicine, because the data is simply not available and we have no submission to work on.  Cannabis would not be authorised as a medicine in the sense that we would see a medicine as being authorised in this regard.<\/p> <p>  If I recall it correctly, another question related to off-label use of medicines.  It is certainly possible for a doctor to prescribe a medicine off-label.  That could include an authorised cannabis medicine for treatment of another condition.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Brien asked about our views on the legislation that would be required to implement the access programme and the role of the International Narcotics Control Board.  I wish to be clear at the outset that the role of the International Narcotics Control Board is a supervisory and monitoring role.  The fundamental purpose of the board is to ensure that for whatever purpose a country permits consumption of a controlled substance, including cannabis, all the elements of consumption, including the manufacturing process and consumption by patients, are appropriately monitored and that monitoring can prevent diversion.  It is usually the case that we have to declare medical needs and consumption to the International Narcotics Control Board.  The board then gives us what is known as a quota or estimate system to which we must adhere in terms of the consumption requirements of the controlled substance.  We need to know the medical uses in terms of adhering to the system of monitoring provided and set out.<\/p> <p>  I was asked specifically for the view of the Health Products Regulatory Authority on legislation and I am willing to answer that point.  Committee members are aware that the progression of legislation is under the remit of the Department of Health.  I imagine officials from the Department will give their views to the committee as well.  Our report has indicated that primary legislation may be required.  Again, it is for the Department to determine whether primary legislation is required to implement these measures, whether secondary legislation is a more appropriate route or whether it can be managed under existing provisions.<\/p><p>That is our statement on the matter.<\/p><p> Deputy Kelleher asked about the position in Europe, in particular the position of the European Medicines Agency, EMA, on the use of medicinal cannabis.  I need to be very clear that the EMA has had no position on medicinal use of cannabis and, simply put, in terms of the current data, the EMA would not be endorsing the medicinal use of cannabis in any way.  The requirements are not there to authorise this as a conventional medicine, which is the business and role of the EMA, and the medicinal use of cannabis simply would not meet the requirements.  Throughout Europe nine countries currently have an access programme that is similar to what we are proposing, which is that it would be available in exceptional circumstances for the treatment of patients who are under specialist medical control and that it would be an exceptional rather than a conventional and widespread use.  Three countries have a wider access programme than we are proposing.  These include The Netherlands, which has a well established programme, Italy and the Czech Republic.  These countries have more widespread prescribing for a range of conditions.  The methodologies these countries use to secure the cannabis-based products that they are using, which are pharmaceutically controlled materials, are also different.  For example, The Netherlands would grow its own cannabis.  A contract is issued by the State to a company to generate the stocks of the cannabis and procure them and then these stocks are supplied to pharmacies that dispense them for patient use.  Sixteen countries have a prohibitive system that would be similar to the current system in Ireland.<\/p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. Elaine Breslin, who will speak about the conditions that were selected and the rationale and basis to the selections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorraine Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelleher for his question.  He asked about the three conditions that we have selected.  We carried out a scientific review of the evidence for the three conditions, namely, spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and intractable severe treatment resistant epilepsy.  The evidence is modest across all of the conditions.  In our review of cannabis, in general we found that the evidence is poor and often conflicting for all of the indications.  When we say conflicting, we mean that different reviewers consider the information to be different.  For example, in the case of pain, one reviewer considered the evidence to be moderate while another stated that it is substantial, although the same data set was used.  It is, therefore, difficult to reconcile those positions when trying to make a recommendation.<\/p> <p>  We have recommended that cannabis could be considered for the three conditions.  We are not recommending treatment with cannabis because there are only three authorised medicines available.  If patients were to have exhausted all available treatments and the feeling was that cannabis could be effective for a particular patient, cannabis treatment could be considered for those particular conditions.  Authorised medicines are available for two of the three conditions and for one of the conditions, which is epilepsy, a cannabidiol oil is currently under development.  Deputy Kelleher asked about the European Medicines Agency.  The medicine has been accepted as an orphan medicine for the conditions of Dravet and Lennox Gastaut because it is recognised that there is an unmet need.  Those are very rare-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":721,"content":"<p>Does it have THC in it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#J00300","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":722,"content":"<p>No; it is pure plant-derived CBD.  That medicine is currently under development and is going through clinical trials.  One paper has been published that gives evidence of some efficacy across a group of epilepsy disorders and other trials are currently under evaluation by the company, which has issued press statements, but we cannot draw any conclusions on the basis of that.  The committee will understand that the normal process is for the papers to be published in peer reviewed journals and the medical community will discuss the evidence that is available.  We understand, however, that the company developing the medicine is planning to make an application in Europe and the US later this year.<\/p><p> The conditions we have chosen have objective end-points that can be measured by consultants monitoring a patient.  Reductions in spasticity and the number of seizures as well as the control of the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy can be assessed.  These are, therefore, objective end-points.  One of the problems one sees with the studies is that cannabis is found to be effective on subjective end-points or patient related effects, whereas when a consultant or doctor treating the patient examines the objective end-points, he or she finds that the efficacy and effectiveness are not necessarily shown.  There are objective end-points for the three conditions.  This is terribly important because this is a monitored pilot programme which will be available to a limited number of patients with the specified conditions under consultant care.  It is important that at the end of the five-year pilot programme, data will be available to show how the cannabis was used for the conditions in question and whether it worked for the individual patients.  This is not the type of data that would be suitable for publication in the sense of allowing others to draw conclusions.  However, it will inform the future direction of cannabis use in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":724,"content":"<p>Why does the Health Products Regulatory Authority have a preference for primary legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#K00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":725,"content":"<p>One of the reasons we suggested primary legislation is that the misuse of drugs legislation, on which I am focusing, currently treats cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug.  It is usually the case that if a substance or drug is to be used medically, it is rescheduled into Schedule 2.  This has been the case, for example, for Salivex, which is an authorised cannabis based medicine.  In the case of Salivex, the confidence in terms of rescheduling it was largely generated by the fact that it was authorised as a medicine.  On the basis of this authorisation, which means it met the full data requirements in terms of quality, safety and efficacy, it was moved into Schedule 2.  There was full confidence in allowing all prescribers to prescribe the drug in line with the conditions that it set out for treating it.<\/p> <p>  The issue here is that we are not proposing a rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2 because we have not reached the point, except in the case of the three products Dr. Breslin mentioned, where they meet the requirements for authorisation of a medicine.  That type of rescheduling is not appropriate in this case.  The reason we suggested primary legislation would be necessary is that one needs to enable some form of prescribing provision for this because the access system currently operates under a licence granted by the Minister.  This places the Minister very much at the heart of the clinical decision making process, which is not appropriate in the context of an access programme that we decide.  Clinicians need to be allowed to use their clinical judgment.  This limited provision allowing a Schedule 1 drug to be prescribed fundamentally changes the construct of the misuse of drugs legislation.  For this reason, we consider that primary legislation would be required.

There have only been two licence applications.  They are both from GPs.  In terms of who makes the licence application, there is obviously an applicant, but the applicant may include supporting documentation or information from others involved in the case.  In a number of parliamentary questions, the Minister has set out what one might generally expect to see in an application for a licence.

I refer members to the statement from the chief medical officer yesterday.  He said that an appropriate application, endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time, has to be submitted to the Department of Health.  A consultant does not have to personally apply in each case, but certainly the consultant should endorse the course of treatment that is proposed and be able to take responsibility for the overall treatment of that patient.

I thank our guests for appearing before the committee.  I have a number of questions.<\/p> <p>  The countries that have introduced the medicinal use of cannabis under strict control were listed.  Are the witnesses aware of any side effects or issues that must be attended to, arising from the use of cannabis in those countries?<\/p> <p>  Do we have the views of conventional pharmaceutical manufacturers on the use of medicinal cannabis, with particular reference to those companies that manufacture cannabis-based medicines?  Have their views been sought in respect of the use of cannabis?  Has there been a comparison of the benefits of cannabis-based medicines versus the use of cannabis for medicinal reasons?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Lorraine Nolan in the course of her address stated, \"To date there is an absence of scientific data demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of cannabis products\".  We must take this into account.  I remember how we dealt with hepatitis C some years ago, where the plan we followed was proven to be incorrect and proved to be costly and detrimental to the quality of life of the patients concerned.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the patients who have been authorised to use cannabis based products, have any ill-effects been detected since they started to use these products?  Does Dr. Nolan have reservations on the use of cannabis based products?<\/p> <p>  We have covered the licence to some extent.  How does the licensing system operate in the countries that have authorised the use of cannabis?  Have problems arisen, or are there issues that we should bear in mind in the context of its use in Ireland?  <\/p> <p>  Dr. Nolan set out three conditions, when she, sounding a note of caution, recommended the use of cannabis.  In regard to the side effects of the use of cannabis, is Dr. Nolan satisfied that she has identified and is aware of the side effects?  Has there been an evaluation of the potential side effects from the possible use of cannabis in the way in which it is proposed to be used in this case?<\/p> <p>  I have already raised the question on cannabis based pharmaceutical products.  How did other countries decide in the first instance on who should have access to the use of cannabis for medicinal reasons?  Did they start with an access programme or did they authorise it in a general way?<\/p><p>We are familiar with some of those countries and their drug regimes but I will not go into that at the moment.<\/p><p> The HPRA advises that cannabis for medical use should only be initiated as part of a structured process of formal ongoing clinical evaluation in patients with clearly defined medical conditions.  That is a serious statement.  Is the HPRA satisfied that it is possible to adequately monitor the potential uses given the proposals that are already on the table?<\/p><p> I refer to ministerial prerogative.  Reference was made to the fact a Minister can make a decision at any time.  That is correct in theory but a Minister must try to avoid a decision that could be detrimental to the public good, the health of the general public or whatever the case may be.  He or she must have regard to those issues at all times.  The point has been covered but I am interested in hearing anything the witnesses wish to add.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#M00600","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":744,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and for all the work they have done on this over a very short period.  The witnesses will agree that a parent will do everything possible to get the best possible care for his or her child.  I refer to a situation where all available medicines have been used but have proved unsuccessful.  The parent then feels the only option is to use a cannabis-based product but the medical adviser is unhappy about coming on board.  The witnesses will understand the frustration of the parent in that situation.  They have outlined where the Minister has the right to issue a licence.  Who is the licence issued to?  Is it the parent, the GP or the medical consultant?  Who is accountable for issuing and monitoring a licence?  It has been mentioned that medical consultants monitor the licence.  Do medical consultants report on the matter?  This aspect has been discussed but it needs to be clarified.  What does one do with a parent who finds it difficult to get his or her medical adviser to come on board?  Is there a mechanism that can be put in place to assist the parent in cases where all other forms of treatment have proved unsuccessful but where there is clear evidence that a cannabis-based treatment might be of assistance?  <\/p> <p>  The matter needs to be clarified because this problem will arise repeatedly if we are talking about having a five-year programme.  Not many medical consultants would be very familiar with this matter.  What do we need to do to ensure there is an adequate level of care for the patient and support for the patient where his or her advisers are reluctant to become involved?  It is extremely important that we clarify this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#N00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I will start with the recommendations made by the HPRA.  Dr. Nolan mentioned that the Netherlands, Italy and the Czech Republic have all followed an approached access to medicinal cannabis.  It is more extensive than the programme proposed by the HPRA and is in line with the proposals for access contained in Deputy Gino Kenny's Bill.  The HPRA has chosen a more conservative approach than the one adopted by the Netherlands, Italy and the Czech Republic.<\/p><p>That happily dovetails with the Government's desire to kill Deputy Gino Kenny's Bill and only allow access in the cases that it decides.  Why?  What is wrong with the approach adopted in the Netherlands, Italy and the Czech Republic?  Why did the HPRA make a recommendation in line with opinion No. 14 instead of something that was in line with what had been adopted in those countries?  Has it any evidence to suggest there was anything irresponsible in the way the Dutch, the Italians or the Czechs had done things?  I suggest it does not.  Is the HPRA even qualified to adjudicate on this matter?  The delegates made the point that Ireland did not have experience.  Countries such as the Netherlands, Italy, the Czech Republic, Canada and so on do.  They have set up cannabis regulatory authorities similar to the one included in Deputy Gino Kenny's proposal and are developing specific expertise.  Those regimes make a distinction between cannabis and other pharmaceutical-type drugs.  It was a political decision.<\/p><p> At the very least, we need to debate which is the better option and hear arguments on both sides instead of just one view.  Other countries which are just as responsible as this one and which have more experience of this issue have made different decisions.  Will the delegates respond to these points?<\/p><p> Why has the question of pain relief been omitted?  Of the 800,000 people who suffer from chronic pain, 40% report that none of the medications they have tried addresses their condition.  They include cancer sufferers who have been left out in the cold in this regard.  Only those who suffer from nausea related to chemotherapy will be allowed into the trial programme.  Why are the 800,000 people mentioned being left out in the cold?  How can that be justified?  It is not only me who is asking the question.  I ask the delegates to respond to David Finn, professor of pharmacology and therapeutics at the Centre for Pain Research in NUI Galway, who is undertaking research in this area.  According to him, it is disappointing that the report does not include a reference to chronic pain because a significant number of patients who suffer from chronic pain could be denied the opportunity to trial cannabis or cannabinoids as a consequence unless the case for their use to treat chronic pain can be strongly argued with the Government such that they will be included in the final legislation.  He points out that one in five people suffers from chronic pain, or approximately 800,000 in Ireland alone, which is of an epidemic scale and all the more reason to do what we can to introduce new treatments that could benefit them, especially when we consider that 40% currently report that their medications are inadequate.  In addition, he believes the concerns about misuse and diversion in the wider community are not unique to the use of cannabis and cannabinoids, as they also apply to opiates which have been the mainstay in pain treatment for decades.  According to him, cannabis has significantly less potential for abuse than opiates and any concern could be mitigated to a large degree were the legislation to allow consultants to prescribe cannabis medicines for the treatment of chronic pain.  Ms Vera Twomey was mentioned.  She has said this, as has Professor Michael Barnes.  I spoke to Ms Twomey in great detail in recent days.  She will not mind me saying she is the person who has been denied medicinal cannabis.  She believes we are taking too conservative an approach, which is why she has been denied access to it.  She does not believe others who are suffering should be denied access to it in whatever approach we take.<\/p><p> On the legislative issue, my heart was sinking while the delegates discussed the time that would be required.<\/p><p>I do not understand this.  We have a Bill before us, Second Stage of which was passed by the D&aacute;il before Christmas, which acknowledges the need for much more research in this area, states we have to have a regulatory authority, states medicinal cannabis should be accessed through a doctor's prescription and attempts to deal with the removal of cannabis from schedule 1, which is an obstacle as has been alluded to.  Why would it take six months, a year or even two years, rather than dealing with the legislation before us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#N00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":748,"content":"<p>Originally we understood the Private Members' Bill would be dealt with by the committee in April and we were not prepared to go into it in any detail today.  When it was discussed on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il before Christmas the Minister stated he had some concerns about the Bill, particularly with regard to Part 12 and the removal of cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act.  The Bill does not propose to move it from one schedule to another but to remove it from the Misuse of Drugs Act, which would have the effect of decriminalising cannabis for all purposes and not just medicinal purposes.  It is also worth noting the Bill tends to circumvent the system for the regulation of medicines as it stands.  We are not speaking about authorised medicines going through the normal regulatory system, which exists to ensure medicines are safe for public use, we are speaking about a separate system for cannabis products.  The committee will deal with the Bill at a later date and we will go into it more detail section by section then.  These are general points.  We all know how long it takes to legislate at present.

Given the nature of their condition, these patients have underlying medical conditions and are possibly on other drugs and from a safety point of view and a drug interaction point of view, it is important that those interactions are measured and monitored.<\/p> <p>  I refer to what is intended going forward.  We have the current licensing arrangement and we are talking about legislation.  This week, we are establishing a medical cannabis reference group, which will provide answers to many of the operational questions that have been identified to date.  The group will have an independent chairperson and it will take into account HPRA and other relevant evidence.  Its membership will be broad-based with all the relevant medical specialties, including oncology, palliative care, neurology, psychiatry, anaesthesia, which includes pain management, general practice, pharmacy, the HPRA, patient representatives and ourselves.  The focus of the group is to provide an operational framework as to how a scheme will work into the future.  It needs to answer clear questions, for example, the clinical criteria for patient access for medicinal purposes, the forms of cannabis that can be used, the roles and responsibilities of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health care professionals who may be involved in the dispensing of cannabis for medical purposes, the requirements for a registry through which the scheme can be monitored and the mechanisms through which further scientific developments in the area can be monitored over time.  This work has started and we anticipate that the first meeting of the group will take place in the coming weeks while we expect a report to be made available within four months.

This is an important area because in many of the countries we have referred to where there are broader access programmes - the Netherlands, Czech Republic and Italy - cannabis is not considered a medicine and, therefore, its side effects are not collected in the same way we collect side effects for conventional medicines.  Part of our role is to collect the side effects.  That is quite different and, in many cases, the establishment of those broader programmes is outside the remit of the regulatory authorities such as ourselves; they are based in the Ministry of health.<\/p><p>The perception of cannabis is quite different.  It is not seen as a medicine but as something else.  Formal data are therefore not collected.<\/p><p> We have data on use in recreational circumstances.  There are many pieces of literature about that.  The safety in short-term use is quite well known.  The side-effects associated with short-term use of cannabis include euphoria, hallucinations, anxiety, paranoia, psychosis, impaired short term memory and confusion, impaired motor co-ordination, altered judgement and increased risky behaviour.  There are some gastro-intestinal side-effects such as diarrhoea.  The effects of long-term use, either recreational or heavy use, are of interest.  We are aware that there is addiction in 9% of cases.  The addiction rate rises to approximately 17% if one begins to use cannabis in adolescence.  If one uses it regularly or is a heavy user, the addiction rate rises to about 50%.  There is an increased risk of chronic psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, particularly in adolescence and in people who are at risk because of a strong family history of psychosis.  We do not know that cannabis causes psychosis.  The literature is not saying that, but it says clearly that cannabis is a preventable risk factor for psychosis.  It is a particular risk for young people who have a family history of psychosis and who use cannabis that is associated with a higher level of tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, which is the psychotogenic component of cannabis.<\/p><p> Another risk associated with long term use is cognitive impairment.  This is important if it is used in young people in adolescence.  There is a potential for cannabis to affect neuro-development and cause neuro-developmental delay.  We see cognitive impairment in older people, with lower intelligence quotient, IQ, among those who are frequent users during adolescence.  I have referred to altered brain development.  It is also associated with poor educational outcomes, increased likelihood of dropping out of schools, a diminished life satisfaction with achievement and what is referred to as the amotivational syndrome.  It is also associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation and attempts and with the symptoms of chronic bronchitis.  All of those side effects are really associated with recreational use.  We do not have good data on the medical use of cannabis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":762,"content":"<p>To support comments made by Dr. Devlin in response to Senator Burke, an issue associated with this access programme will be the system of implementation and the supports put in place for implementation.

Explaining the availability of products and how to report side effects as Dr. Breslin has outlined are important matters, even at that simple level.  With regard to setting this up, we have come from a situation where we have had very restricted access and are working off a licensing provision.  The support and education of both clinicians and patients will be important in moving forward with the access programme.<\/p> <p>  With regard to progressing the situation and medical thinking, I do not want to undermine what Dr. Devlin said, that the relationship between a patient and clinician is sacrosanct and should not be interfered with.

Why has pain been left out?  Can Dr. Nolan respond to the points made by Professor Finn that I read to her?  I want to stress this, particularly after Dr. Breslin's intervention.  Professor Finn said that the long list of adverse side effects of recreational cannabis use have very little to do with what we are discussing here, which is about medicinal use.  Is it not the case, as alluded to by Professor Finn, that we have a whole range of authorised drugs at the moment where the adverse side effects - there is strong evidence of this - are as bad as, or in many cases much worse than, any evidence we have for adverse effects from medicinal cannabis?<\/p> <p>  OxyContin opiate, known as hillbilly heroin, is widely prescribed as an end-of-the-line painkiller.  It is authorised and is highly addictive.  Benzedrine and Prozac are highly addictive and there is much evidence of adverse effects.  Their efficacy is questionable and it is certainly a debatable issue, but they are authorised.  There is a much lower bar for how they can be prescribed and who can prescribe them.  A general practitioner can prescribe those things, so why and on what basis have we decided that only a consultant can prescribe cannabis for medicinal use?  A GP is a registered specialist so why can a GP not prescribe cannabis?  None of these things is being explained.<\/p> <p>  A view is being put here but we are not hearing the counter view.  We need to hear the counter view as expressed by Professor Finn, Professor Barnes and many other eminent people.  No doubt people from the Netherlands, Italy and the Czech Republic would come in here and give a pretty different perspective on all this.  That needs to be acknowledged in any debate.  That is not to say who is right or wrong.  People have their opinions but what we are getting here are opinions, not definitive positions.  Nobody can claim to have the absolutely correct position because there are diverse opinions across the medical area and in how states deal with this by way of legislation or regulation.  That needs to be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. Nolan could deal with the specific issue of pain, given the points that Professor Finn has made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#S00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":767,"content":"<p>I want to reassure Deputy Boyd Barrett that we had intended answering his questions; I just happened to answer Senator Burke's questions first.  The Deputy asked why we would choose to align ourselves with those nine countries that have a restrictive access programme versus those three countries in Europe that have a wider access programme.  We need to be clear that we have not aligned ourselves with any particular country or position taken by a European country with regard to this.  What we have done is review the available scientific evidence on this issue.  We have also reviewed the position in other countries but what we have ended up with, in terms of the proposals for the access programme, is based upon a review of the available science.  However, it is also taking into account the Irish context, the Irish health care system and the view of those clinicians who are practising within the Irish health care system because whatever comes from this has to be implementable in the Irish context.  That is an important point to make at the outset.<\/p> <p>  The position, and it is not a question of alignment, is that none of those three countries in Europe changed to a very wide access programme in one move.  No country has moved from a position where it had very strong prohibition to a position where it has a wide programme of access in one change.  Those three countries have all moved through this process of having a restricted form of access programme in which they can gather and generate information on their needs.  They know their needs and requirements before they move to a wider access programme and they also know, coming back to the International Narcotics Control Board, INCB, issue I spoke of earlier, their consumption needs in that context, which is an important point in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned pain.  I want to say at the outset that in the course of conducting our review we had a number of discussions with Professor David Finn.  He has contacted us since the Irish Pain Society's statement has come out and we are in the process of discussing it with him.<\/p> <p>  With regard to pain, the Deputy is right.  One in five or 800,000 people suffers from chronic pain, so we acknowledge the number of people who are impacted by pain.  In that context, we can understand that people suffering from pain are looking for alternative approaches to treatment.  However, when we reviewed the data on that, and the Deputy mentioned the Barnes review, including the Corcoran review, the national academy's report and those of the Journal of the American Medical Association and others, we saw that they all look at pain.  Twenty-eight pain studies have been conducted in this area and when we look at those pain studies we see that pain is a symptom associated with many conditions.  It is not ring-fenced in the way epilepsy or spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis can be.  It is an outcome of very many diseases and conditions.  Those studies are looking at pain across a variety of contexts.  They are also looking at a wide range of products including some of the medicines that are authorised that we spoke about such as Nabilone and Dronabinol.  The nabiximols, which would be Satifex, would be one of those also.  They are also looking at cannabis, which is smoked and inhaled.  We are looking at no standardisation in terms of the type and the form of the product used or investigated in those pain trials and no standardisation of the conditions.  It is incredibly difficult, therefore, to draw objective evidence from that.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to objective evidence, the outcomes for patients in those trials is very different when we look at the detail, depending on whether it is the doctor who is reporting on those outcomes versus the patient.  That is because pain is subjective.  If I experience pain I may say mine is ten on a scale of one to ten whereas the Deputy's might be five.  That is very much down to the individual.  That is the problem in looking at all of those pain studies.

The problem is the risks have not been appropriately qualified.  If one wants to have a system under which one potentially expose 800,000 people to risks, that is a huge jump in moving forward.  What we are saying is that in order to ensure the correct levels of patient protection it is more important to look at the issue in a different way.  We are certainly not closing the door on use for pain relief.  We are simply saying the evidence is currently not strong enough to move forward because their use cannot be ring-fenced in the way that it can be for other patients.<\/p> <p>  I would like to come back to the point Dr. Elaine Breslin made about end points, namely, that for all of the conditions chosen under the access programme there are measurable end points that can be determined.  A doctor can look at how a patient's spasticity is responding to the treatment and make a decision on whether the treatment is working and if it is not, it is not acceptable or appropriate to expose him or her to an unqualified risk.  It is the same issue in the treatment of nausea associated with chemotherapy.  It is obvious whether the use of cannabis is working in the treatment.  Similarly, in the treatment of epilepsy.  There are measurable end points, but there are no end points in the treatment of pain which fundamentally is one of the problems.<\/p> <p>  The point on opiates to which I would like to come back concerns the idea of whether they provide a less addictive alternative.  I am not saying it does not have validity, but it simply has not been studied.  Nobody has looked at the effects in switching patients from opiates to cannabis and determined whether it is less addictive.  Nobody knows what dose of cannabis one could try for a patient.  The evidence is simply not available.  It needs to be studied and the evidence brought forward.  The access programme can give a lot more information and confidence in how the system could be worked.  Nobody is saying clinical research should not be encouraged alongside it.  In this country, much of it due to Professor David Finn's efforts, a huge range of preclinical research has been conducted.  We really need to harness, work with and back it from a policy perspective and carry out more properly conducted trials on pain subjects.  Including within the programme pain patients will not generate data in the way needed to bring them forward because it is not a formal clinical trial programme.  That is an important distinction in this respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#U00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorraine Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":777,"content":"<p>Professor David Finn does not agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#U00800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":778,"content":"<p>As I mentioned, what we are trying to do in this group is bring the clinical community with us.<\/p><p>We have national standards for clinical development, under the ages of the national clinical effectiveness committee.

I agree entirely with the levels of pain being determined by the individual rather than in some general application of rules.

As a person who suffers from back problems from time to time, I can tell the committee all about it.

It is unfair to try to bring them into this debate because we are talking about two completely different scenarios.  For example, Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to some prescribed medicines, for example, Prozac.  If a person was to take the drug in an unsupervised setting the side effects could be considerably more harmful than if it were prescribed while being monitored by a doctor.  We cannot compare like with like in that regard and I do not believe we should be muddying the waters on the issue.  Anyone who has ever seen someone who is addicted to Prozac will know that it is completely different from someone who is taking Prozac for a short period.<\/p><p> We have now established that we are looking at a minimum of six months for legislation with the possibility of 18 months.  The only option available at the moment is the licensing arrangement.  The Chairman has asked for clarification and it is important we get it.

However, the consultant need not prescribe it himself or herself; a doctor can prescribe it.  Can the witnesses clarify this point?<\/p><p> The Chairman made another point relating to a consultant.  If a consultant gets a licence, is it universal to other individuals or must it apply on a case-by-case basis?<\/p><p> My final point relates to costs.  If we are considering whether to bring forward legislation for people to access cannabis-based medicines, then obviously a cost arises.  In the normal way of things, drugs are reimbursed through public health schemes provided it is an authorised medicine.  That is my understanding.  In this case, we have cannabis for medicinal purposes.  While a trial period is under way, it is not going to be recognised as a medicine.  Does this have implications for reimbursement costs?  Have we examined that?  If we are looking to provide a scheme for the coming five years, then will some reimbursement programme be put in place?  Is that even possible without it being classified as a medicine?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#V00400","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":784,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy O'Brien.

I apologise if I am repeating points that have been dealt with in my absence.<\/p> <p>  I wish to clarify the answer given by Dr. Nolan before I left.  Dr. Nolan said that the patient who claims to require this medication must be under the supervision of a consultant but that, in theory, the prescription could be written by a registered medical practitioner.  This applies only under three specified conditions, namely, resistant epilepsy, nausea to do with cancer treatment and multiple sclerosis.<\/p> <p>  One requirement to access the programme is that those involved have exhausted or used all other forms of medication.  Perhaps the pharmacist, Ms Maria Egan or whoever is most suitable could outline the answer.  There are examples of interactions that arise between medications and common foods, such as the interaction of certain medications with grapefruit.  Often people do not identify the interaction between warfarin and spinach.  Interactions with medicines are not simple.  Obviously, there are the effects of medicines on other medicines but other issues can emerge through the use of certain medicines.  This is not straightforward.  If something has not been trialled correctly and is mixed in with other mediations or foods, then the data are not available.  People can actually die from the use of some over-the-counter products with warfarin.  I say as much simply as an example to show that it is not as clear-cut as ticking a box.<\/p><p>As I was leaving, it was stated that the European Medicines Agency has no position on this and does not endorse CBD as the evidence is not suitable.  Is that correct?  Have I understood that correctly?<\/p><p> As a pharmacist and on Deputy O'Brien's point on side effects of Prozac, having a prescription does not change the side effect profile of something.  It does not really matter if one is taking Prozac or anything else with a prescription; the side effects will be the same.  It just means that someone is responsible and the person is part of a care pathway.<\/p><p> On reimbursement costs, many unlicensed medicines are reimbursed.  They get special reimbursement.  My concern is that Holland, whose pharmacy system I am quite familiar with, has specific pharmaceutical grade product with specific concentrations that are used.  Perhaps I am not understanding it, but will the witnesses elaborate on what exactly we are saying is okay in these three conditions?  Is it an arbitrary concentration of a product or an arbitrary derivative?  Are we looking at a specific breed of plant, extract or concentration?  What do we have when it comes to dosage and indication?

I hope there is agreement on it but, as we are concluding, it would be helpful to clarify or acknowledge that the job of the HPRA is, as I understand it, to work within certain EU directives and frameworks to approve a drug to be used an dispensed.  As I understand it, it is not about deciding the efficacy of a particular product for a particular patient.  I think that is an important distinction and perhaps those from the HPRA or others might want to confirm it.  Notwithstanding the clear differences of opinion, I also hope it is acknowledged that other choices have been made and that other opinions exist.  These include those of medical professionals as well as regulatory authorities and Legislatures in other States.  There is no particular reason to believe that whatever recommendations or opinions are adopted here are superior to the opinions or decisions that have been made by other States.

Sometimes an application can come in at the start without much substance, but it builds up over time until it can cross the necessary hurdle.

One can probably say from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, report and the Minister's acceptance of that report, there is a clear political direction - the Government has decided this is the way it is going and has set out the three conditions under which the access programme will be available.  If one is a consultant working in those areas, one will know the Government has made a policy decision in that direction.<\/p> <p>  The issue of liability has not been raised directly with us.  Consultants who work in the public system are in the clinical indemnity scheme and sometimes they prescribe products that are not authorised, but their employers are aware of the treatment that is proposed and have approved it.  Consultants cannot decide to prescribe, but if the authorities are aware that one is trying a product, for which one has a licence from the Minister, that is a different scenario.  <\/p> <p>  Those issues can be explored further.  I am not sure that is the absolute barrier in the case of a consultant working in a public hospital.  My belief is that in some cases, the fact that they are not dealing with an authorised medicine, the evidence may not be sufficient for some consultants at this stage to use such a medicine.  Possibly the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, report and the work of the group that Dr. Devlin has referred to may provide further confidence in these medicines.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Devlin may elaborate further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Lennon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488888000,"counter":820,"content":"<p>If a doctor or a consultant is unable to provide a treatment for whatever reason, the Medical Council is very clear that the doctor must co-operate with whoever provides it, to include transfer of notes.  That depends on the interaction between the patient and the doctor.  The doctor is then obliged to go along with that.  The possibility is there for a second opinion.<\/p> <p>  The other issue that has been raised is the role of doctors and consultants, as two separate entities.  Of course it is not like that in practice.  Whether it is this or any other aspect of clinical care, most care is provided on a shared care basis, so the doctor is working together with the GPs.  Shared care means that the roles and responsibilities for consultants and GPs are clearly identified so the GP knows what he or she is doing and the consultant knows what he or she is doing.  The difference between consultants who work in acute hospitals and general practice is just in respect of their training programmes.  Consultants have great expertise and training in specific disease clinical areas and have developed a competence and expertise which may give them greater knowledge in relation to particular issues, whether it be neurosurgery, and so on.  General practitioners on the other hand are generalists.  When it comes to dealing with complex drug interactions, it is quite relevant and clinically appropriate that one would have the advice of the consultant available who would have an understanding of the condition, which may be a rare condition, which the GP may or may not have and be able to manage that.  In other words that is a clinically appropriate way of dealing with a very complex case.  Certain patients may often be on multiple medications.  The consultant, by virtue of the training and expertise has a good understanding of those interactions, hence it is reasonably appropriate that there is consultant supervision in terms of what is now essentially a new treatment being proffered.<\/p> <p>  There needs to be an education on this and that is part of the work of this group.  When the procedures, operating clinical protocols and everything else are put in place these are communicated to the relevant specialties including general practice and will be part of the training on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017030700002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Devlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1488888000,"counter":821,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Devlin.

Where are we going if we circumvent the clear advice and research of the Health Products Regulatory Authority?  The HPRA is not a mean organisation that wants to stop people getting medication, rather it safeguards the health of the nation regarding medicines.  <\/p><p> When thalidomide was first launched a good few years ago, it was deemed a wonder drug that would relieve morning sickness.  As it turned out, the trial data for the medication did not exist but I will not bore the committee with the details.  Anybody who suffers hyperemesis will happily take whatever one is handed.  Let us say the trial data did not exist but we had a person or two in Ireland who suffered severe hyperemesis as a result of pregnancy.  Theoretically, we could have a case where somebody who is suffering from severe morning sickness could approach the Minister and say, \"I want this drug prescribed\".  If we go ahead with the proposal for the State to indemnify consultants and children are born without limbs, the onus will be on the State.  <\/p><p> As the committee will know, I am familiar with the framework which was not developed to be mean to people or to avoid giving people things.  It exists to safeguard the health of the people of this country.  To my mind, it is a very robust system.  I have never had a difficulty with it.  As a pharmacist, I am quite uncomfortable with the three conditions that have been recommended.  I am fine with the framework and can see where it comes from, but what about the sanctity of the doctor's position, be it a GP or a consultant?<\/p><p> It is a bad state of affairs when the State starts telling medical professionals what they should do and that it will provide insurance if a person's arm falls off or whatever.  What are we at here?  We have good systems in place, yet we are trying to get around them.

I want everyone to get what they can get if it is right for them to get it and it will improve their lives, but let us not rip up the rule book.  Medication can cause terrible unintended consequences.  We could spend all night talking about this matter.  The witnesses know, some committee members know and I know that terrible side effects have been caused by medications that were never anticipated.  That is why we have robust trials and assessment of medicines.  Everyone thought thalidomide was great until the second isomer emerged.

From our review, we know that a number of products could be supplied using this route.  Some are effectively cannabis flowering tip itself, where the cannabis plant is grown in carefully controlled conditions that comply with the European good manufacturing practice, GMP, requirements.  While a product would not necessarily meet the full standard requirement for authorisation of a medicine, we have a reassurance of the quality of the product.  This relates to the content of the cannabinoids in it, namely, the CBD and THC content.  Knowing the products' content will provide a basis for working out a dosing regime.  This might answer the Deputies' questions.<\/p> <p>  There is also the potential for a number of processed oils that are extracted from the plant and contain cannabinoids to be sourced.  Some of the companies that manufacture these products are interested in considering these and putting them through clinical trial programmes so that they may become authorised as medicines.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Boyd Barrett's question on opinions on this matter, we are a medicines regulatory authority.  Our job is to ensure that the medicines that are available in our market are safe, appropriate and work for patients.  Our fundamental reason for being is the protection of public health.  It is difficult to have any discussion on cannabis for medicinal use without the question of it being a medicine on the table.  This is about the best outcome for a patient.  The medicines system and framework exist in Europe in order to protect public health.  For example, Deputy O'Connell mentioned the thalidomide disaster.  Everything we do is founded on that principle.  Were I, as chief executive of our authority, asked to put any other substance on the market for access to a wide group of patients when I could not say whether it worked or was fully safe, committee members would ask me why I did that and why I was negligent.<\/p> <p>  Other countries that have examined this topic outside of a medicines programme ended up with two parallel systems and ran into difficulties.  That has been the experience in Australia and Canada, where policy has seen an access programme set up but clinicians do not know whether the substance works and clinical societies have advised that, from a clinical perspective, it is not safe and they do not know whether it treats anything.
