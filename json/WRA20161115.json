Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of information on the courts system.  However, to be of assistance I have made inquires with the Courts Service and they have provided the figures requested by the Deputy which I am including by way of a tabular statement.  It should be noted that where a summons is struck out not served, the summons can be reissued at the request of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so a number of the offences listed as struck out for non-service are likely to have been reissued. <\/p><p>The figures provided by the Courts Service indicate that a significant percentage of cases are struck out for non-service.  My officials are seeking clarification from the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to the reason for this figure being at this level. It should however be noted in this respect that a working group was established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine how the rate of summons serving can be improved and to regularly monitor the level of summons service throughout the country.  While this group has reported improvements in the rate of successful service of summons, challenges remain in relation to effecting service of summons in certain circumstances, relating to such matters as inaccurate address data, persons moving address, or living in multi-occupancy dwellings or other settings which make service difficult.  In addition, certain persons will take steps to evade service.  Similar difficulties are experienced by many other police forces.<\/p><p>I would like thank the Deputy for raising the serious issue of speeding on our roads.  The increase in the number of road traffic fatalities in the year to date highlights the need to continue to deploy all effective measures to reduce speeding, and therefore road traffic collisions.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that road traffic enforcement is an operational matter and, as such, is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.  I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Roads Policing Operations Plan 2016 incorporates a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies.  The focus of the Roads Policing Operations Plan for 2016 is on the most vulnerable road user categories of motor cyclists, pedal cyclists, pedestrians and learner permit holders. Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including speeding.  Road traffic legislation is also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads. <\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 also sets out key strategic objectives for Roads Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Road Policing plans over the next 5 years.  The Deputy is no doubt aware of the significant investment in Garda resources currently underway. This investment is closely associated with delivery on the Modernisation and Renewal Programme. <\/p><p>In addition, I will be meeting the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport later this month at the biannual Ministerial Committee on Road Safety, which oversees the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy and provides a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues. <\/p><p>In so far as the recording of driver licences is concerned, the Courts Service has taken the following steps:<\/p><p>-  All summonses issued in respect of alleged offences under the Road Traffic Acts include a specific provision that notifies the person accused of the offence that he\/she must bring to the court their driving licence\/driving permit and a legible copy of their driving licence or learner permit; <\/p><p>- Court Registrars, following consultation with the presiding Judge, make an announcement in the court to the effect that as required by the summons, persons must produce their driving licence\/permit and a copy thereof to the Registrar once their case is called;<\/p><p>- Where a driving licence\/learner permit or copy thereof is produced and the accused is convicted of the offence, the Registrar records the driving licence number for the purpose of subsequently transferring the driving licence number to the Department of Transport for the application of penalty points;<\/p><p>- Where a driving licence\/learner permit or copy thereof is not produced, the Registrar records this fact on the summons\/minute book.<\/p><p>Road safety is of course a shared responsibility and it is incumbent upon us all to play our part by driving within the speed limit. <\/p><p>Table 1 - Report on the Number of Speeding Offences listed for Court between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 December 2015 and

This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  It is important we build on this success by ensuring that Garda numbers continue to increase.  The Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide-ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. <\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 12 have been assigned to the Cork City Division.  Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November, which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. <\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister, has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based  training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  <\/p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Cork City Division, like all other Garda Divisions, will benefit from these new resources becoming available.<\/p><p>For ease of reference I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation to the number of Garda stations and number of Garda assigned to the Cork City Division on 31 October 2010 and 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, for the record.<table><tr><th colspan=\"3\"><div><b>Cork City Division 31 Oct 2010<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>ANGLESEA STREET DISTRICT<\/td><td>ANGLESEA STREET<\/td><td><div>281<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BARRACK STREET<\/td><td><div>21<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BLACKROCK<\/td><td><div>30<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BRIDEWELL<\/td><td><div>21<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total<\/td><td><div>353<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GURRANABRAHER DISTRICT<\/td><td>BALLINCOLLIG<\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BLARNEY<\/td><td><div>17<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>GURRANABRAHER<\/td><td><div>60<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>RATHDUFF GRENAGH<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total<\/td><td><div>101<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYFIELD DISTRICT<\/td><td>MALLOW ROAD<\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MAYFIELD<\/td><td><div>59<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MC CURTAIN STREET<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>WATERCOURSE ROAD<\/td><td><div>48<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total<\/td><td><div>112<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOGHER DISTRICT<\/td><td>BISHOPSTOWN<\/td><td><div>23<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CARRIGALINE<\/td><td><div>21<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CROSSHAVEN<\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>DOUGLAS<\/td><td><div>28<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>PASSAGE WEST<\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOGHER<\/td><td><div>59<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total<\/td><td><div>138<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK CITY DIVISION<\/td><td>18 Stations<\/td><td><div>704<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><div><\/div><table><tr><th colspan=\"3\"><div><b>Cork City Division 30 Sept 2016<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>ANGLESEA STREET DISTRICT<\/td><td>ANGLESEA STREET<\/td><td><div>277<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BLACKROCK<\/td><td><div>25<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BRIDEWELL<\/td><td><div>27<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td><div>329<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GURRANABRAHER DISTRICT<\/td><td>BALLINCOLLIG<\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BLARNEY<\/td><td><div>18<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CARRIG NA BHFEAR<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>GURRANABRAHER<\/td><td><div>52<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL <\/td><td><div>91<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYFIELD DISTRICT<\/td><td>GLANMIRE<\/td><td><div>19<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MAYFIELD<\/td><td><div>51<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>WATERCOURSE ROAD<\/td><td><div>45<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td><div>115<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOGHER DISTRICT<\/td><td>BISHOPSTOWN<\/td><td><div>21<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CARRIGALINE<\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CROSSHAVEN<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>DOUGLAS<\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>PASSAGE WEST<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOGHER<\/td><td><div>48<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td><div>113<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK CITY DIVISION<\/td><td>16 Stations<\/td><td><div>648<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500058#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Estimates Publication","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500058#WRA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[34836\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500058#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when her Department will publish a Revised Estimate for 2017; her Department&rsquo;s projection for additional costs arising for the Garda budget; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of around &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the Service over the next 12 months through: <\/p>  <p>- an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;<\/p>  <p>- the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;<\/p>  <p>- the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by Garda&iacute;.  This payment will be worth &euro;510 per annum to a Garda with 34 days annual leave; and<\/p>  <p>- the  implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate through the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Labour Court recommendation, new recruits who do not currently receive rent allowance, will have it restored, in addition to the other improvements I just listed.  In addition, the increment freeze in place for GRA members since 1 July will be lifted and any arrears arising from increments foregone will be paid.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda Associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action over the course of the four Fridays in November to facilitate a ballot of their membership.  This was a very welcome decision by the Garda Associations and has ensured that a full policing service remains in place.<\/p>  <p>  The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and agreed last week to accept its recommendation.  The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course.<\/p>  <p>  The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions, including that of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.  The nature of the Labour Court's recommendation is such that some of the cost of the implementation of the proposals, if they are accepted by the members of AGSI and the GRA, depend on the amount of overtime worked in any year.  That said, I am advised that, depending on a number of variables, the estimated gross annual cost of implementing the Labour Court Recommendation could exceed &euro;50m; however, this gross cost will be offset by statutory deductions for tax, PRSI, etc., which will reduce the net Exchequer cost.<\/p>  <p>  Once the outcome of the ballots is known and if the proposals are accepted, the additional budgetary cost will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In that regard officials of both Departments have had an initial discussion on the issues.  The question of the publication of revised Estimates is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  What is most important at this juncture is that members of AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's  recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500058#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Levels","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500058#WRA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[34685\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500058#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if recorded crime statistics for County Kerry are an accurate reflection of the reality of crime in the area; if all Garda stations in County Kerry have access to the PULSE system; if not, the details of the stations without access; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>Crime statistics are compiled by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) based on PULSE data and the statistics for Kerry Garda Division reflect all crime incidents recorded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for that area.  The Deputy will be aware that in the most recent CSO figures, for Quarter 2 of 2016, there were decreases in many crime categories.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor and in the Kerry Garda Division the figures show a reduction in Burglary of 32%.<\/p><p>In recent times, the CSO has carried out two important reviews of the quality of crime statistics, following on concerns raised in the 2014 Report of the Garda Inspectorate on Crime Investigation.  The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country.<\/p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate.  The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area.<\/p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar.  This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Gardai directly on PULSE.<\/p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised.  As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process.  This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.<\/p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the Crime Statistics.  In this regard, I understand that the CSO intends to provide further analysis of crime data quality in due course which will help us to gauge, at that stage, how successful the ongoing work to achieve improvements in our crime statistics has been.<\/p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to supporting this work and this is underlined by the investment of &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.<\/p><p>In relation to the specific question of PULSE access for Garda stations, as a number of Deputies have sought similar information in relation to various counties, I propose to provide those Deputies with a table with this information and to include the table in the Official Report.<\/p><p>I might add that the question of enhancing rural access to the Garda network is being examined as part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021.  This includes plans to introduce mobile technology solutions to enable operational Garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations.<\/p><p>However, as I have explained, the availability of PULSE in a given Garda station is not a prerequisite for the accurate recording and classification of crime data.<table><tr><th>Division<\/th><th>Names of Garda Stations in these areas without access to PULSE<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Co.

Under the Act, the Garda S&iacute;ochana Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is now the prescribed body authorised to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure directly to GSOC.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC, the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is no doubt aware of the measures that the Garda Commissioner outlined at her meeting last June with the Policing Authority.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published its Protected Disclosures Policy and all Garda members and civilians have been informed of this policy.  In addition the Garda Commissioner has appointed a Protected Disclosures Manager who will be supported with a dedicated and properly trained team.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure that whistleblowers are protected and supported.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the public interest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having robust policies and procedures in place to support and protect whistleblowers and to ensure that their complaints or allegations are fully investigated, I signalled during the D&aacute;il debate on the O'Higgins Report that I would refer certain matters to the independent Policing Authority.  To that end, I wrote to the Authority on 2 June 2016 requesting that in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) they submit a report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers\/whistleblowing.  I also asked that they make any recommendations that they consider appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are appropriate and can provide assurance that whistleblowers can make complaints or allegations in a safe environment where their complaints or allegations are properly investigated.<\/p>  <p>  The Policing Authority has completed its review and reported to me last week.  The Report was published on my Department's website on Friday and has been laid before both Houses in accordance with the Act.  The Report contains a number of recommendations almost all of which have been accepted by the Commissioner and I understand that a revised version of the Policy will be published by the Commissioner shortly.  The Commissioner is committed to providing an environment in which protected disclosures can be made in full knowledge that persons making such disclosures will be supported and protected in the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  All of this points to significant changes in the regime for making protected disclosures by members of the Garda&iacute; and the significant protections afforded to those who make protected disclosures.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of a number of instances where there have been allegations that individuals have been subjected to bullying and harassment.  I would again make the point that all of us in this House must be very careful in discussing individual cases of whistleblowing.  Protection for whistleblowers rightly prioritises the confidentiality of the process, which is central to the efficacy of the process, so I do not propose to discuss individual cases.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has assured me that she is committed to providing a positive and supportive working environment for all Garda personnel.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Dignity at Work Policy, entitled &ldquo;Working Together to Create a Positive Working Environment\", outlines the policy and procedures for dealing with Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying in the Workplace.  The main objective of the policy is to achieve a safe and harmonious working environment that encourages and supports the right to dignity at work.

The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area.<\/p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar. This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Garda&iacute; directly on PULSE.<\/p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised. As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process. This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.<\/p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the Crime Statistics.

In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

In addition, the increment freeze in place for GRA members since 1 July will be lifted and any arrears arising from increments foregone will be paid. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has also made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda Associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action over the course of the four Fridays in November to facilitate a ballot of their membership.

In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 5 have been assigned to the West Cork Division. Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. <\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.<\/p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the West Cork Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available.<\/p><p>For ease of reference I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation to the number of Garda stations and number of Garda assigned to the West Cork Division on 31 October 2010 and 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, for the record.<table><tr><th colspan=\"3\">CORK WEST DIVISION 31 OCT

County Laois reflect all crime incidents recorded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for that county.<\/p><p>In recent times, the CSO has carried out two important reviews of the quality of crime statistics, following on concerns raised in the 2014 Report of the Garda Inspectorate on Crime Investigation. The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country. <\/p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate. The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area. <\/p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar. This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Garda&iacute; directly on PULSE. <\/p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised. As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process.

Under the Act, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is now the prescribed body authorised to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure directly to GSOC.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC, the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is no doubt aware of the measures that the Garda Commissioner outlined at her meeting last June with the Policing Authority. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published their Protected Disclosures Policy and all Garda Members and civilians have been informed of this policy. In addition the Garda Commissioner has appointed a Protected Disclosures Manager who will be supported with a dedicated and properly trained team. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure that whistleblowers are protected and supported.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the public interest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having robust policies and procedures in place to support and protect whistleblowers and to ensure that their complaints or allegations are fully investigated, I signalled during the D&aacute;il debate on the O'Higgins Report that I would refer certain matters to the independent Policing Authority. To that end, I wrote to the Authority on 2 June 2016 requesting that in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) they submit a report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers\/whistleblowing.  I also asked that they make any recommendations that they consider appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are appropriate and can provide assurance that whistleblowers can make complaints or allegations in a safe environment where their complaints or allegations are properly investigated. <\/p>  <p>  The Policing Authority has completed its review and reported to me last week.  The Report was published on my Department's website on Friday and has been laid before both Houses in accordance with the Act.  The Report contains a number of recommendations almost all of which have been accepted by the Commissioner and I understand that a revised version of the Policy will be published by the Commissioner shortly.  The Commissioner is committed to providing an environment in which protected disclosures can be made in full knowledge that persons making such disclosures will be supported and protected in the workplace.  <\/p>  <p>  All of this points to significant changes in the regime for making protected disclosures by members of the Garda&iacute; and the significant protections afforded to those who make protected disclosures.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has assured me that she is committed to providing a positive and supportive working environment for all Garda personnel.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Dignity at Work Policy, entitled &ldquo;Working Together to Create a Positive Working Environment\", outlines the policy and procedures for dealing with Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying in the Workplace.  The main objective of the policy is to achieve a safe and harmonious working environment that encourages and supports the right to dignity at work.  I am informed that the Commissioner has established  an internal Garda Working Group to review the current practice and policies in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  and this work is currently ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500060#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Community","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500060#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[34826\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500060#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason she has not introduced legislation to provide legal recognition of the Traveller community as an ethnic group in law.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be already be aware, there is a comprehensive consultation process underway, led by my Department, to develop a new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy to improve the situation for the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland. Phase 1 (identification of key themes for the new Strategy) and Phase 2 (identification and agreement of high level objectives under each agreed theme) of that consultation process have been completed.  The final phase, Phase 3 (identification of detailed actions to achieve each agreed objective, with associated time-scales, key performance indicators, institutional responsibilities and monitoring arrangements), is currently underway.  This process will provide a new set of specific, cross-Departmental actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma.  It is intended that the new Inclusion Strategy will run from 2016 to 2020 and that it will be in place later this year.  As part of Phase 3, regional public consultations took place from 22 September 2016 - 27 September 2016; I attended two of those consultations (in Dublin and in Athlone, respectively) and I am delighted to report that overall attendance and participation were encouraging and positive.  Feedback from those consultation sessions is being collated by my officials and the draft Inclusion Strategy will be updated accordingly.  I plan to submit the final draft of the Inclusion Strategy to Government shortly for consideration and sign-off.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group is being considered in the context of the development of the Inclusion Strategy.  In September 2015, my predecessor brought a paper to Cabinet Committee on Social Policy on the question of recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within Irish society.  This followed a process of dialogue with the national-level Traveller NGOs during 2015, which culminated in the presentation of an agreed position paper by them and confirmation that there are no legal or legislative or expenditure implications arising from such recognition.  As such, there are no plans to introduce new legislation in this regard.  The key benefit is that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely symbolically important to Traveller pride, to Traveller self-esteem and to overcoming the legacy of marginalisation and discrimination that the community has experienced. Such a symbolic gesture &ndash; as the Traveller NGO paper argues &ndash; creates a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in seeking sustainable solutions based on respect and honest dialogue.<\/p>  <p>  I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014). When I spoke earlier this year at the Traveller Pride awards, I stressed that we need to broaden the discussion on this issue.  The debate needs to be taken forward in an inclusive way.

The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country. <\/p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate. The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area. <\/p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar. This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Garda&iacute; directly on PULSE. <\/p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised. As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process. This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.<\/p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the Crime Statistics. In this regard, I understand that the CSO intend to provide further analysis of crime data quality in due course which will help us to gauge, at that stage, how successful the ongoing work to achieve improvements in our crime statistics has been. <\/p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to supporting this work and this is underlined by the investment of &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. <\/p><p>In relation to the specific question of PULSE access for Garda stations, as a number of Deputies have sought similar information in relation to various counties, I propose to provide those Deputies with a table with this information and to include the table in the Official Report. <\/p><p>I might add that the question of enhancing rural access to the Garda network is being examined as part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021. This includes plans to introduce mobile technology solutions to enable operational Garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations.  <\/p><p>However, as I have explained, the availability of PULSE in a given Garda station is not a prerequisite for the accurate recording and classification of crime data. <table><tr><th>Division<\/th><th>Names of Garda Stations in these areas without access to PULSE<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Co.

Furthermore, my Department continues to be engaged in extensive consultations both with the Judiciary and the Courts Service in relation to ongoing drafting work.  The Bill has benefitted from past review by the judiciary who considered it as part of the work of the Interim Judicial Council which has been established pending the Bill&rsquo;s enactment.  <\/p><p>The Bill, when published, will provide for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board of that Council.

I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no function in decisions in this regard.<\/p><p>The Valuation Act 2001 as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act. Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes. In general, the Act maintains the long-standing position that all commercial properties - including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates.  <\/p><p>I understand that inconsistency in the approach to the exemption from rates for childcare and education facilities and calls to exempt all such providers were among the issues raised at a number of stages during the passage of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015.  As a result, the Government approved an amendment to the Bill, to insert into Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 an exemption from rates for properties occupied by parties that provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit<b><i><\/i><\/b>basis. This extension of the childcare and education exemption removed an anomaly that previously existed where those that provided childcare and education on a charitable basis were exempt but those that did so on a not-for-profitbasis were not. Since the commencement of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, the Valuation Office has been updating the valuation lists to give effect to this extension of the exemption so that it became effective for qualifying providers in 2016.<\/p><p>The decision taken by Government to extend the exemption from rates for early childcare and education was taken having considered the views of stakeholders in the sector. As outlined in Oireachtas debates during the passage of the legislation, key valuation principles have to be respected to retain the integrity and equity of a system that is a significant source of funding for Local Authorities. One of those principles is that properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable. There are a variety of other more appropriate means through which Government can and does support the provision of such services. Making exception to core, long-standing valuation principles can have a far reaching negative impact on the rates system and consequently a far reaching impact on Local Government funding.<\/p><p>In addition to the exemption of those that provide childcare and early education on a not-for-profit basis, paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 also exempts from rates childcare facilities that only provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme.<\/p><p>The Acts are quite specific about the range of exemptions that can be allowed by the Commissioner, who has no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4.  As a matter of course, the Valuation Office examines all claimant cases on their individual merits by reference to the relevant statutory provisions governing the operation of the Valuation Acts as they relate to pre-school childcare facilities and all other categories of properties.<\/p><p>Regarding the payment of rates by individual ratepayers, the Deputy will be aware that under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Valuation Office multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of the local authority. The latter is a reserved function of the elected members and the Commissioner of Valuation has no function in this regard.<\/p><p>Private childcare facilities which are operated for profit, form part of the rateable valuation base on a nationwide basis. The exemption from rateability of such facilities would reduce local authority revenues, which if it were not to entail an increase in Exchequer funding of local authorities, would have to be made good by imposing a corresponding increase on the remaining ratepayers. Accordingly, there are no plans at this time to extend the exemption from rates to for-profit childcare facilities, which as I have indicated would represent a significant departure from core valuation principles. However, the Deputy will be aware of the wide range of measures being pursued by my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in relation to the childcare sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500060#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Industrial Relations","counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500061#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[34748\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500061#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the costs of the Lansdowne Road agreement on Garda pay for 2017; the areas in which each cost arises and the numbers impacted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":124,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, following intensive negotiations between the Government, the Garda Representative Association (GRA) and Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commission, the Labour Court  issued a recommendation on 3 November last in relation to the dispute.  In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of around &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the Service over the next 12 months through:<\/p>  <p>  - an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;<\/p>  <p>  - the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;<\/p>  <p>  - the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by Garda&iacute;.  This payment will be worth &euro;510 per annum to a Garda with 34 days annual leave;<\/p>  <p>  - the  implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate through the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Labour Court recommendation, new recruits who do not currently receive rent allowance, will have it restored, in addition to the other improvements I just listed.  In addition, the increment freeze in place for GRA members since 1 July will be lifted and any arrears arising from increments foregone will be paid. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has also made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda Associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action over the course of the four Fridays in November to facilitate a ballot of their membership. This was a very welcome decision by the Garda associations and has ensured that a full policing service remains in place.<\/p>  <p>  The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and agreed last week to accept its recommendation.  The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course. <\/p>  <p>  The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions including of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.  The nature of the Labour Court's recommendation is such that some of the cost of the implementation of the proposals, if they are accepted by the members of AGSI and the GRA, depend on the amount of overtime worked in any year.  That said, I am advised that, depending on a number of variables, the estimated gross annual cost of implementing the Labour Court Recommendation could exceed &euro;50m; however, this gross cost will be offset by statutory deductions for tax, PRSI, etc., which will reduce the net Exchequer cost. <\/p>  <p>  Once the outcome of the ballots is known and if the proposals are accepted, the additional budgetary cost will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p>  <p>  What is most important at this juncture is that members of AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500061#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Haddington Road Agreement Review","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500061#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[34839\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500061#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the review of Garda pay and conditions that was to be completed by 1 June 2014 is still ongoing; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":127,"content":"<p>The Haddington Road Agreement provided for a review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the following terms of reference:<\/p><p><i>To review and make recommendations on the use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the resources available to it, with the objective of achieving and maintaining the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in its operation and administration.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. <\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 15 have been assigned to the Cavan\/Monaghan Division.  Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. <\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based  training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  <\/p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Cavan\/Monaghan Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available.<\/p><p>For ease of reference I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation to the number of Garda stations and number of Garda assigned to the Cavan\/Monaghan Division on 31 October 2010 and 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, for the record.<table><tr><th colspan=\"3\">CAVAN\/MONAGHAN DIVISION 31

matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>Crime statistics are compiled by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) based on PULSE data and the statistics for County Meath reflect all crime incidents recorded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for that county. <\/p><p>In recent times, the CSO has carried out two important reviews of the quality of crime statistics, following on concerns raised in the 2014 Report of the Garda Inspectorate on Crime Investigation.  The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country. <\/p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate.  The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area.<\/p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar.  This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Garda&iacute; directly on PULSE.<\/p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised.  As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process.  This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.<\/p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the Crime Statistics.  In this regard, I understand that the CSO intend to provide further analysis of crime data quality in due course which will help us to gauge, at that stage, how successful the ongoing work to achieve improvements in our crime statistics has been. <\/p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to supporting this work and this is underlined by the investment of &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. <\/p><p>In relation to the specific question of PULSE access for Garda stations, as a number of Deputies have sought similar information in relation to various counties, I propose to provide those Deputies with a table with this information and to include the table in the Official Report. <\/p><p>I might add that the question of enhancing rural access to the Garda network is being examined as part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021.  This includes plans to introduce mobile technology solutions to enable operational Garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations.<\/p><p>However, as I have explained, the availability of PULSE in a given Garda station is not a prerequisite for the accurate recording and classification of crime data.<table><tr><th><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Division<\/font><\/th><th><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Names of Garda Stations in these areas without access to PULSE<\/font><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Co.

In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of around &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the Service over the next 12 months through:<\/p>  <p>  - an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;<\/p>  <p>  - the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;<\/p>  <p>  - the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by Garda&iacute;.  This payment will be worth &euro;510 per annum to a Garda with 34 days annual leave;<\/p>  <p>  - the  implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate through the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Labour Court recommendation, new recruits who do not currently receive rent allowance, will have it restored, in addition to the other improvements I just listed.  In addition, the increment freeze in place for GRA members since 1 July will be lifted and any arrears arising from increments foregone will be paid. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has also made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda Associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action over the course of the four Fridays in November to facilitate a ballot of their membership.  This was a very welcome decision by the Garda associations and has ensured that a full policing service remains in place.<\/p>  <p>  The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and agreed last week to accept its recommendation.  The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course. <\/p>  <p>  The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions including of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.  The nature of the Labour Court's recommendation is such that some of the cost of the implementation of the proposals, if they are accepted by the members of AGSI and the GRA, depend on the amount of overtime worked in any year.  That said, I am advised that, depending on a number of variables, the estimated gross annual cost of implementing the Labour Court Recommendation could exceed &euro;50m; however, this gross cost will be offset by statutory deductions for tax, PRSI, etc., which will reduce the net Exchequer cost. <\/p>  <p>  Once the outcome of the ballots is known and if the proposals are accepted, the additional budgetary cost will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p>  <p>  What is most important at this juncture is that members of AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500061#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500061#WRD01750"},{"type":"question","counter":147,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[34687\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500061#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda stations and the number of garda&iacute; in each in County Kerry on 31 October 2010 and on 31 October 2016; the proportion of the proposed 800 additional recruits in 2017 that are likely to be assigned to County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. <\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.

However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  <\/p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Kerry Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming

In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.

The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country. <\/p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate.  The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area. <\/p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar.  This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Gardai directly on PULSE.<\/p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised.  As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process.  This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.<\/p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the Crime Statistics.  In this regard, I understand that the CSO intend to provide further analysis of crime data quality in due course which will help us to gauge, at that stage, how successful the ongoing work to achieve improvements in our crime statistics has been. <\/p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to supporting this work and this is underlined by the investment of &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. <\/p><p>In relation to the specific question of PULSE access for Garda stations, as a number of Deputies have sought similar information in relation to various counties, I propose to provide those Deputies with a table with this information and to include the table in the Official Report. <\/p><p>I might add that the question of enhancing rural access to the Garda network is being examined as part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021.  This includes plans to introduce mobile technology solutions to enable operational Garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations. <\/p><p>However, as I have explained, the availability of PULSE in a given Garda station is not a prerequisite for the accurate recording and classification of crime data.<table><tr><th>Division<\/th><th>Names of Garda Stations in these areas without access to PULSE<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>West Cork<\/td><td>Inishannon<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Kilbrittain<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Timoleague<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Kealkil<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Glengarrif<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Durrus<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Ballydehob<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Drimoleague<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Roscarberry<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Baltimore<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Drinagh<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Coachford<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Crookstown<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Tarelton<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Ballydesmond<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Boherbue<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Rathmore<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500061#WRD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500062#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[34661\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500062#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda stations and the number of garda&iacute; in each in counties Carlow and Kilkenny on 31 October 2010 and on 31 October 2016; the proportion of the proposed 800 additional recruits in 2017 that are likely to be assigned to counties Carlow and Kilkenny; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of around &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the Service over the next 12 months through:<\/p>  <p>  - an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;<\/p>  <p>  - the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;<\/p>  <p>  - the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by Garda&iacute;.  This payment will be worth &euro;510 per annum to a Garda with 34 days annual leave;<\/p>  <p>  - the  implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate through the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Labour Court recommendation, new recruits who do not currently receive rent allowance, will have it restored, in addition to the other improvements I just listed.  In addition, the increment freeze in place for GRA members since 1 July will be lifted and any arrears arising from increments foregone will be paid. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has also made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda Associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action over the course of the four Fridays in November to facilitate a ballot of their membership.  This was a very welcome decision by the Garda associations and has ensured that a full policing service remains in place.<\/p>  <p>  The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and agreed last week to accept its recommendation.  The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course. <\/p>  <p>  The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions including of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.

In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of around &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the Service over the next 12 months through:<\/p><p>- an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;<\/p><p>- the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;<\/p><p>- the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by Garda&iacute;.  This payment will be worth &euro;510 per annum to a Garda with 34 days annual leave;<\/p><p>- the  implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate through the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.<\/p><p>Under the Labour Court recommendation, new recruits who do not currently receive rent allowance, will have it restored, in addition to the other improvements I just listed.

This Act permits me to authorise an interception but only for the purposes of criminal investigation into serious offences or in the interests of the security of the State.  The operation of the Act is overseen independently by a Designated Judge of the High Court who reports to the Taoiseach on his examination of its operation.  In addition, a Complaints Referee (a serving judge of the Circuit Court) receives and investigates complaints from persons who believe that their communications have been unlawfully intercepted.  If the Complaints Referee finds that there has been a violation of the Act he can order that the interceptions cease and recommend the award of compensation.<\/p>  <p>  The interception of communications is not a matter that is regulated at EU level.

Part IIA of that Act, comprising sections 19A to 19H, as inserted by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, provides for offences in relation to illegal trespass and occupation of land.  Such land includes privately owned land and public land provided or maintained by a statutory body or held in trust primarily for the enjoyment of the public.  The legislation empowers the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to direct trespassers to leave the land concerned and remove any object belonging to them from the occupied land.  A person who is guilty of an offence under this Part of the Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;4,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to one month, or both.<\/p>  <p>  Trespass in relation to buildings, as well as land, is also dealt with in the 1994 Act.

A person who is guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months, or both.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, section 13(1) of the same Act provides that it is an offence for a person, without reasonable excuse, to trespass on a building or in the vicinity of a building in such a manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person.  Section 13(2) empowers the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to request the person concerned to desist from acting in such a manner and to immediately leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner.  It is an offence not to comply with a direction given by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under section 13(2).  A person who is guilty of an offence under section 13(1) is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 12 months, or both.

Under this Act it is an offence to forcibly enter land, including buildings, or remain in forceful occupation, or to encourage or advocate the commission of such an offence.  A person guilty of a first offence under the Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months, or both.  A second or subsequent offence under the Act is punishable, on summary conviction, by a fine of up to &euro;1,000 or imprisonment for term of up to 12 months, or both.

In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  <\/p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. <\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 5 have been assigned to the Sligo\/Leitrim Division. Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. <\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  <\/p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country. <\/p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate. The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area. <\/p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar. This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Gardai directly on PULSE. <\/p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised. As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process. This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.<\/p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the Crime Statistics.

The final phase, Phase 3 (identification of detailed actions to achieve each agreed objective, with associated time-scales, key performance indicators, institutional responsibilities and monitoring arrangements), is currently underway. This process will provide a new set of specific, cross-Departmental actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma. It is intended that the new Inclusion Strategy will run from 2016 to 2020 and that it will be in place later this year. As part of Phase 3, regional public consultations took place from 22 September 2016 - 27 September 2016; I attended two of those consultations (in Dublin and in Athlone, respectively) and I am delighted to report that overall attendance and participation were encouraging and positive. Feedback from those consultation sessions is being collated by my officials and the draft Inclusion Strategy will be updated accordingly. I plan to submit the final draft of the Inclusion Strategy to Government shortly for consideration and sign-off.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group is being considered in the context of the development of the Inclusion Strategy. In September 2015, my predecessor brought a paper to Cabinet Committee on Social Policy on the question of recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within Irish society. This followed a process of dialogue with the national-level Traveller NGOs during 2015, which culminated in the presentation of an agreed position paper by them and confirmation that there are no legal or legislative or expenditure implications arising from such recognition. As such, there are no plans to introduce new legislation in this regard. The key benefit is that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely symbolically important to Traveller pride, to Traveller self-esteem and to overcoming the legacy of marginalisation and discrimination that the community has experienced. Such a symbolic gesture &ndash; as the Traveller NGO paper argues &ndash; creates a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in seeking sustainable solutions based on respect and honest dialogue. <\/p>  <p>  I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014). When I spoke earlier this year at the Traveller Pride awards, I stressed that we need to broaden the discussion on this issue. The debate needs to be taken forward in an inclusive way. My officials and I are currently working to advance this issue with national Traveller organisations in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500063#WRF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500063#WRF01150"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[34698\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500063#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda stations and the number of garda&iacute; in each station in County Waterford on 31 October 2010 and on 31 October 2016; the proportion of the proposed 800 additional recruits in 2017 that are likely to be assigned to County Waterford; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p><p>I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Kildare Division, on the 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 307.  There are also 23 Garda Reserves and 26 civilians attached to the Division.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.

I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.

The implementation of the Traveller Accommodation Programme of each local authority, including the draw-down of funds, in accordance with the 1998 Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, is a matter for each individual authority.    I have no plans to establish a Traveller agency. My officials and I engage in an ongoing process of dialogue with the national-level Traveller NGOs. It is important to have positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in order to identify sustainable solutions to the challenges faced by the Traveller community, based on respect and honest dialogue.<\/p>  <p>  There is a comprehensive consultation process underway, led by my Department, to develop a new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy to improve the situation for the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland. Phase 1 (identification of key themes for the new Strategy) and Phase 2 (identification and agreement of high level objectives under each agreed theme) of that consultation process have been completed. The final phase, Phase 3 (identification of detailed actions to achieve each agreed objective, with associated time-scales, key performance indicators, institutional responsibilities and monitoring arrangements), is currently underway. This process will provide a new set of specific, cross-Departmental actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma. It is intended that the new Inclusion Strategy will run from 2016 to 2020 and that it will be in place later this year. As part of Phase 3, regional public consultations took place from 22 September 2016 - 27 September 2016; I attended two of those consultations (in Dublin and in Athlone, respectively) and I am delighted to report that overall attendance and participation were encouraging and positive. Feedback from those consultation sessions is being collated by my officials and the draft Inclusion Strategy will be updated accordingly. I plan to submit the final draft of the Inclusion Strategy to Government shortly for consideration and sign-off.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group is being considered in the context of the development of the Inclusion Strategy. In September 2015, my predecessor brought a paper to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy on the question of recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within Irish society. This followed a process of dialogue with the national-level Traveller NGOs during 2015, which culminated in the presentation of an agreed position paper by them and confirmation that there are no legal or legislative or expenditure implications arising from such recognition. The key benefit is that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely symbolically important to Traveller pride, to Traveller self-esteem and to overcoming the legacy of marginalisation and discrimination that the community has experienced. Such a symbolic gesture &ndash; as the Traveller NGO paper argues &ndash; creates a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in seeking sustainable solutions based on respect and honest dialogue. <\/p>  <p>  I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014). When I spoke earlier this year at the Traveller Pride awards, I stressed that we need to broaden the discussion on this issue. The debate needs to be taken forward in an inclusive way. My officials and I are currently working to advance this issue with national Traveller organisations in this regard.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500064#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Resettlement Programme","counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500064#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":255,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[34751\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500064#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she has raised with the Italian authorities the delays being experienced by Irish officials in Italy in the processing of Syrian refugees for relocation here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Harassment is deemed to occur where a person seriously interferes with the other's peace and privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other. Section 10(3) also provides for orders to be made by the court to prevent communication by any means with the victim or to approach within any distance specified by the court of the place of residence or employment of the victim. Such an order can be made even in circumstances where the accused person is not convicted of the offence if the court is satisfied, having regard to the evidence, that it is in the interests of justice.

In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of around &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the Service over the next 12 months through:<\/p><p>-  an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;<\/p><p>-  the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;<\/p><p>-  the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by Garda&iacute;.  This payment will be worth &euro;510 per annum to a Garda with 34 days annual leave;<\/p><p>-  the  implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate through the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.<\/p><p>Under the Labour Court recommendation, new recruits who do not currently receive rent allowance, will have it restored, in addition to the other improvements I just listed.  In addition, the increment freeze in place for GRA members since 1 July will be lifted and any arrears arising from increments foregone will be paid. <\/p><p>The Government has also made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda Associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. <\/p><p>On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action over the course of the four Fridays in November to facilitate a ballot of their membership. This was a very welcome decision by the Garda associations and has ensured that a full policing service remains in place.<\/p><p>The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and agreed last week to accept its recommendation. The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course. <\/p><p>The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions including of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.  The nature of the Labour Court's recommendation is such that some of the cost of the implementation of the proposals, if they are accepted by the members of AGSI and the GRA, depend on the amount of overtime worked in any year.  That said, I am advised that, depending on a number of variables, the estimated gross annual cost of implementing the Labour Court Recommendation could exceed &euro;50m; however, this gross cost will be offset by statutory deductions for tax, PRSI, etc., which will reduce the net Exchequer cost. <\/p><p>Once the outcome of the ballots is known and if the proposals are accepted,  the additional budgetary cost will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p><p>What is most important at this juncture is that members of AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's  recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.  <b><font color=\"#000080\"><\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500064#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Funding Disbursement","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500064#WRG02650"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[35144\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500064#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if proposed changes to the Lottery Act 1956 would drive spending away from local voluntary groups; the way changes may affect key lottery income to local community organisations (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":286,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the General Scheme of the Gambling Control Bill was published in July 2013 following approval by the Government and is currently being drafted by the Office of  the Parliamentary Counsel.

In July the Government approved my proposals for a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which combines the Government&rsquo;s response to the report of the Garda Inspectorate and the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the visibility, effectiveness and responsiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In this regard it sets out an overall vision of a Garda workforce of 21,000 comprising 15,000 Garda&iacute;, 2,000 Reserves and 4,000 civilians to be to be achieved incrementally over five years in tandem with the delivery of reforms.  The delivery of this overall vision is supported by provision in the 2017 Estimates for the recruitment of 800 trainee Garda&iacute;, up to 500 additional civilian staff and 300 Reserves. <\/p>  <p>  The reform plan has three interlocking elements that must work together if it is to succeed-<\/p>  <p>-  the reform measures themselves which are designed to deliver 21st century policing in a world class policing service;<\/p>  <p>  -  the resources in terms of increased numbers of Garda&iacute;, Reserves and Civilians backed up by the substantial capital investment of &euro;311m already earmarked for ICT, the fleet and Garda stations under the Capital Plan 2016-2021; and<\/p>  <p>  -  the enhanced implementation structures to ensure delivery leveraging the resources and statutory remit of the Policing Authority.<\/p>  <p>  The vehicle for the reform agenda will be the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 published in June which captures the bulk of the recommendations of the Inspectorate Report. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of civilians the plan sets a target of 20% to bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na more into line with international norms.  This in effect means an increase in the number of civilians to 4,000. This will be achieved through (i) a &lsquo;civilian by default&rsquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and (ii) redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties that may be done by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  It is worth noting that the Inspectorate Report suggests that there are up to 1,250 Garda&iacute; in such posts including in the Garda Technical Bureau, ICT, Human Resources etc. The Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority will prepare a plan by the end of this year to realise this target by 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  As I have said, the bulk of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations have been accepted. However,  it is not intended to implement at this time the recommendations of the Inspectorate aimed at reducing the number of regions and Divisions having regard to the major reform programme underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the importance of ensuring visible leadership and maintaining and enhancing the close links between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  These recommendations will be kept under review. <\/p>  <p>  The Policing Authority is an independent statutory body established on 1 January 2016.  Its role is to oversee the performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to policing services, to promote public awareness of policing matters and to promote and support the continuous improvements in policing in Ireland. Its mission is to drive excellent policing through valued and effective oversight and governance.<\/p>  <p>  Since its establishment, the Policing Authority has been focusing, as a matter of priority, on its functions which have statutory deadlines and reform significance.  The Policing Authority has met on several occasions with the Commissioner and her senior team, as a follow up on its consideration of the O&rsquo;Higgins Report and related matters.  A number of these meetings have been held in public to reassure the community about the performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Areas that have been highlighted in the discussions include:<\/p>  <p>  -  Implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;<\/p>  <p>  -  Review of the Garda Protected Disclosure policy;<\/p>  <p>  -  Plans to conduct a culture audit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;<\/p>  <p>  -  Corporate governance arrangements and management structures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and<\/p>  <p>  -  Arrangements for training and the professional development of members<\/p>  <p>  The Authority has approved a three year Strategy for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has also determined the policing priorities for 2017 which will inform the content of the 2017 Policing Plan  which will be published before the end of the year.  It has reviewed and issued recommendations on the Garda Protected Disclosure policy and will also establish a Code of Ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for Garda members.  <\/p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) has a hugely important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded, and has extensive powers under the 2005 Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities.  Significant changes were made to the powers of GSOC in the last two years including making GSOC a designated body for receiving protected disclosures.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that we have in place the most effective possible mechanism for the investigation of complaints and I met with the Chairperson of GSOC last month in the context of considering what further changes are desirable.

The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course. <\/p>  <p>  The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions including of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.<\/p>  <p>  It is most important at this juncture that members of AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the gradual restoration of remuneration for all public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement started this process, and by September next year, public servants will have received &euro;1,900 in restoration.  The first report of the Public Service Pay Commission established by the Government and chaired by Mr Kevin Foley, former Chair of the Labour Court, is to address the issue of the unwinding of the Financial Emergency in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts and to help provide the Government with a roadmap for exiting this legislation and addressing further pay restoration. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500066#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders Re-examination","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500066#WRJ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[34586\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500066#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in determination of eligibility pursuant to section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person referred to is the subject of a Deportation Order made on 17th May 2012 and therefore has no entitlement to residency in the State.<\/p><p>Representations were received from the person<b><\/b>concerned pursuant to Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), to revoke the Deportation Order.

Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to communities. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the existing station network continues to provide the necessary levels of policing services through a centralisation of services which in turn has facilitated the introduction of enhanced patrolling systems that are operational and intelligence led.  This helps to ensure that a high visibility and community-oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout Divisions nationwide and yields a number of benefits, including:<\/p>  <p>  -  increased Garda visibility and patrol hours;<\/p>  <p>  -  increased mobility and flexibility within an area resulting in an improved policing service to the public;<\/p>  <p>  -  enhanced co-ordination of Garda activity resulting in a greater visibility and presence in the communities;<\/p>  <p>  -  more effective use of finite resources across a wider area; and<\/p>  <p>  -  continued Garda presence in communities.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the Government's commitments under the Programme for a Partnership Government.

I have also requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis and the outcome of this pilot scheme will feed into the wider review being overseen by the Authority.<\/p>  <p>  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the significant investment of some &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021 which provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.

The immediate focus includes the phased commencement of Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols.  Following this, in the new year, the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced in tandem with the developing resource base and capability of the new body.  <\/p>  <p>  Now that the members and Chairperson of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority have been duly nominated, approved by motions of each House of the Oireachtas and appointed and have held their inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016, the working focus is, of necessity, on the managed roll-out of the Authority's functions.  For the sake of good order this has to be done in tandem with the phased commencement, by the Government, of the various remaining Parts and provisions of the 2015 Act.  Moreover, the setting of establishment day of the Authority for 1 October 2016 has automatically triggered a number of working obligations on the new Authority several of which are statute-bound in terms of their delivery deadlines and in terms of the completion of public consultations and reports on the specified matters concerned.  These are tasks for which the new Authority will need to build up its working resources in the short term and I know that the Authority is already taking action in this regard.  Both my Department and the new Regulatory Authority will, therefore, continue to liaise closely by way of ensuring that we can successfully coordinate the commencement, from my side as Minister, and delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various provisions concerned. <\/p>  <p>  I would also point to the fact that Part 14 of the 2015 Act contains a series of miscellaneous provisions which deal with a range of matters and is not, therefore, a Part which deals with a single component of the new regulatory regime.  These provisions, therefore, are of varied application in relation to the rest of the 2015 Act and are being dealt with accordingly in the ongoing determination of their respective commencement dates.  As the Deputy will be aware, the general commencement provision in Section 1 of the Act is such as to allow for the commencement of particular provisions within a Part, where necessary, without a necessity to commence the entirety of the provisions in that Part.  The provisions of Part 14 deal with disparate matters such as the legal immunity of the Regulatory Authority; the right of audience of solicitors; barristers in employment providing legal services to their employer; money laundering; restriction on withdrawal from a case; the service of notices; regulation of movement between the two legal professions and the advertising of legal services. Aligning all of these issues across the 2015 Act is, therefore, a complex task for which a unilateral solution cannot be imposed.

This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  It is important we build on this success by ensuring that Garda numbers continue to increase.  The Government has put in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging programme of reform which is being implemented in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition, approximately 300 appointments will be made to the Garda Reserve. <\/p><p>The ongoing recruitment process will support all policing operations, including special targeted strategies such as Operation Thor<b><font color=\"#000080\">, <\/font><\/b>which marks a significant step-up in the Garda response to burglaries and related crime.An additional &euro;55 million has been provided in 2016 resulting in a more than doubling of the overtime allocation for 2016, bringing the total to over &euro;90 million. For 2017,  I have secured a further &euro;71.5 million for Garda overtime which will facilitate the continuation of large scale policing operations, including those targeting gangland crime and burglary.<\/p><p>Furthermore, investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.

However, having regard to a number of unique factors, including the fact that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a single national police force which provides a security and intelligence service as well as a policing service, international policing models may require tailoring to our circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Section 117(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 specifically requires the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to benchmark their recommendations by reference to the best standards of comparable police services.

The Commissioner&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 is the vehicle for implementing the agreed Government Plan for Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Key reforms being implemented include the replacement of the current District model of policing with a Divisional model where responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis. However, in implementing this reform, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is required to continue to maintain the close relationship it has with communities in large rural Divisions. The Plan also contains a commitment to increase the number of civilian staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  in line with international norms. A  medium term target of achieving 20% civilians by 2021 is proposed to this end. I have asked the Policing Authority to monitor the implementation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the Plan and to provide regular progress reports to the Department on the matter. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to policing practices, I would point to the Garda Commissioner's responsibility under section 26 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to direct and control the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

This commitment is underlined by very significant investments in Garda resources. <\/p>  <p>  Community Policing continues to be a key aspect of the Garda approach to the prevention and detection of crime.

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Kildare Division, on the 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 307.  There were also 23 Garda Reserves and 26 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. <\/p>  <p>   I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 25 have been assigned to the Kildare Division. Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. <\/p>  <p>  The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Kildare Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500068#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500068#WRL00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Government Expenditure","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500068#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[34797\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500068#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the expenditure limit for 2017; the amount of expenditure forecast for 2017; the consequences for Ireland of exceeding the expenditure limit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>In Budget 2017, total general government expenditure of &euro;76.6 billion is forecast for next year.

In this context I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank to request that an assessment be undertaken of the range of available sustainable restructure solutions offered by banks and non-bank entities and\u00a0that this assessment should consider in particular how the available options may impact on the distressed borrower's capacity to remain in their primary residence. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has recently submitted\u00a0its report to me and my officials are currently reviewing it.  The report\u00a0provides valuable insights on the range of\u00a0available mortgage restructure options offered by banks and non-banks.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The CCMA is a statutory code under section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and lenders to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of the CCMA\u00a0under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should be aware that the numbers in mortgage arrears have been steadily declining.  Data released by the Central Bank on 13 September shows that to end-Q2 2016, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) has declined for the last\u00a0twelve quarters.  Some 120,614 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured.  It is clear that where a borrower actively engages with their lender under the CCMA\u00a0with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that the borrower will be able to remain in their family home. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500068#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living City Initiative","counter":427,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500068#WRL01025"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[35109\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500068#WRL01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"following the publication of the action plan for housing and homelessness four months ago the status of the progress made to date on action 5.10 to review the living city initiative with a view to further enhancing the attractiveness and effectiveness of the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I consider that this particular relief has lost focus since its introduction because of changes made to how it operates over the years.  The purpose of my amendment is to realign the exemption with its original policy objective i.e. to alleviate the hardship of an inheritance tax liability for a person who inherited a house in which he or she had been living with the deceased and to ensure that the person did not have to sell the house to pay the tax liability.  The changes I have proposed will have two principal effects. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, the exemption will only be available for inheritances.  With one exception, it will no longer be possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house.  The exception will be where a person gifts a dwelling house to a dependent relative.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor's spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, the inherited dwelling house must have been the disponer's principal private residence at the date of death.

When first announced, the stated purposes of individualisation were, essentially, to ease the burden on single persons (65% of the work force), to take workers on the average industrial wage out of the higher rate of tax and more generally to facilitate a reduction in the numbers paying tax at the higher rate.  Prior to this, a second spouse faced the marginal rate of tax on the first euro (or Punt as it was then) earned in his or her own name.<\/p>  <p>  Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but never completed.  The result is that we now have a hybrid system.  Up to &euro;9,000 of the standard-rate band can be transferred between spouses and the full married personal tax credits, can be allocated in full to one spouse.  Because the income tax system allows married couples to choose whether to be jointly or individually assessed, there can be a difference between the tax liabilities incurred by married couples on the same household income, depending on the method of assessment chosen.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to stress that married one-earner couples on average earnings are not affected by the different standard rate bands under the current structure as the married one-income band standard rate band of &euro;42,800 is in excess of the current average wage.  Furthermore, the &euro;9,000 transferable standard rate band, which married one earner couples can avail of, reduces their income tax liability to around half that incurred by a single individual earning a similar income.<\/p>  <p>  The difference in treatment for couples depending on whether one or both work may be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that there are costs associated with earning an income, such as travel and childcare costs.  Such costs are likely to be greater if two persons, rather than one person, work outside the home to earn the same gross income.<\/p>  <p>  It is my view that individualisation has now bedded into the tax system to a degree where it cannot be changed easily, and there are no plans to do so.  It was estimated last year that to complete or to reverse individualisation would cost in the region of &euro;800 million.  Such a cost, if it related to the reversal of individualisation, would result in an increased burden of taxation on other cohorts of taxpayers including single parent families and single individuals.<\/p>  <p>  However, you may be aware that a Home Carer Tax Credit may be claimed where one spouse works primarily in the home to care for a dependent person, such as a child or an elderly relative.  This credit was introduced in the context of the move towards individualisation of the tax system, in recognition of the choices made by families where one spouse stays at home to care for children or the elderly.  In the recent Budget, I announced an increase in this credit from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,100 per year, effectively allowing the credit to shelter family income of &euro;5,500 from taxation.  This follows on from last year's Budget where the credit was increased from &euro;810 to &euro;1,000.<\/p>  <p>  The constitutionality of the various provisions of the tax code are ultimately a matter for the courts to decide, where issues are put before them.  However, I would point out that due regard is given to the provisions of the Constitution when constructing the tax code.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of tax individualisation was considered by the Commission on Taxation in 2009 and that body recommended no change should be made to the current system.  It concluded that the current system represents a balance between, on the one hand, acknowledging the choices families make in caring for children and, on the other, taking account of the need to encourage labour market participation.<\/p>  <p>  As regards future measures, in the Programme for a Partnership Government there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the USC as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefit for high earners.  The changes introduced in the last three Budgets have commenced reducing the income tax burden with an emphasis on low and middle income earners, and it is my intention to continue this process in future Budgets, as fiscal resources allow.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to childcare, this is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in the first instance.  Minister Zappone has announced the introduction of a new Affordable Childcare Scheme which will be available to all families both single income and double income.  It is important to recognise that the Affordable Childcare Scheme is only one element of a broader set of commitments and supports aimed at parents and children.\u00a0 The provision of improved services for centre-based care is very important, as also are the needs of children who do not attend such services. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People contains a commitment to produce Ireland's first-ever National Early Years Strategy.\u00a0\u00a0The intention is to deliver a cross-cutting strategy which will take a joined-up, whole of Government approach to the issue of supporting children and their families during the early years (0-6 years).  The drafting of the National Early Years Strategy is at an advanced stage and the Department of Children will hold an Open Policy Debate on the strategy before the end of the year with a view to publication shortly thereafter.

This is contributing to what we know is already a considerable strain on some students and their families to participate in higher education with knock-on effects on completion rates.  The reality is that dealing comprehensively with this issue will only take place as part of a more general programme to address the major housing and homelessness issue.<\/p><p>Accordingly, my colleague Mr. Simon Coveney T.D., Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, on 19 July 2016 published <i>&ldquo;<\/i><i>&rdquo;<\/i>, following Government approval of this comprehensive and ambitious Plan.  The full plan can be accessed at:<i><\/i>.<\/p><p>My Department worked closely with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in developing this Plan, with a specific focus on student accommodation, and I very much welcome the commitments contained in the plan and I look forward to working with colleagues on a cross-Departmental basis to ensure that the commitments contained in the Plan are implemented as soon as practicable.<\/p><p>The current position in respect of the specific measures relating to student accommodation as detailed in <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>is as follows:<\/p><p><i>(i) The Department of Education and Skills in conjunction with a number of other key stakeholders will prepare and publish a national student accommodation strategy, which will set out a broad framework for delivery of an enhanced level of accommodation and which will inform local authority housing strategies and the land management process in general, in order to provide suitably located and affordable sites.  This will be prepared with a view to developing a national policy on specific needs and mechanisms for the development of appropriate on-campus and off-campus student accommodation.<\/i><\/p><p>Action: <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>details that this plan will be in place by Q2 2017 and my Department is working on the development of this plan with a view to meeting the timescale envisaged in <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>.<\/p><p><i>(ii) My Department will work with stakeholders to prioritise and progress viable projects to provide additional student accommodation in key urban areas.  This will be done with a view to bringing on stream proposals capable of delivering an additional 7,000 student accommodation places by end 2019, on or off campus, in addition to projects already committed to.<\/i><\/p><p>Action: <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>details that the initial assessment will be completed during Q4 2016 and officials from my Department are working closely with officials from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government with a view to meeting the timescale envisaged in <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>.<\/p><p><i>(iii) Dedicated delivery structures, such as Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) will be established in the Higher Education Institutions (HEI) sector to access Housing Finance Agency (HFA) funding, and complete any required policy, regulatory or legislative changes necessary.  This will be done with a view to providing additional funding mechanisms for the HEI sector, in conjunction with the HFA.<\/i><\/p><p><i>(iv) The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will enable student accommodation projects for 100 units or more to go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as well as maximise the opportunities for joint venture projects on local authority sites to proceed through the Part 8 process and prepare guidance on planning policies around student accommodation developments.  This will be done to enhance certainty and reduce delivery timescales and costs associated with bringing student accommodation proposals forward.<\/i><\/p><p>Action: To facilitate early action on new processes and structures which are key to the delivery of housing and the regulation of the housing sector, the Government approved the publication of the General Scheme of a Planning and Development (Housing and Residential Tenancies) Bill in September and is now prioritising its drafting and full publication to enable a number of legislative actions and reforms highlighted across the five pillars of the Action Plan.  This includes facilitating (for a limited time-period) planning applications for large-scale housing developments and student accommodation developments, being made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and facilitating Higher Education Institutes to borrow monies from the Housing Finance Agency for the purposes of financing student accommodation provision.  Officials from my Department have been linking in directly with officials in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and with representatives of the Higher Education Institutions around the modalities and practicalities for implementing these measures once the proposed legislation has been implemented.<\/p><p><i>(v) The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will help to fund a Student Housing Officer to work with the Union of Students in Ireland, local authorities, AHBs and housing providers, to identify and expand short-term capacity enhancing measures in the student accommodation sector.  This will be done with a view to assisting students in finding appropriate accommodation.<\/i><\/p><p>Action:  Funding for a Student Housing Officer to work with the Union of Students in Ireland has been agreed for 2016 with a commitment to examine future funding needs going forward.  This builds on the funding of &euro;30,000 which was provided to Union of Students in Ireland (USI) by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) to fund their 2016 #HomesForStudy campaign.<\/p><p><i>(vi) Funding mechanisms will be established for Institutes of Technology to support the development of their student accommodation capacity.  This is to facilitate the Institute of Technology sector in developing their potential for on-campus student accommodation through addressing current borrowing capacity and funding constraints.<\/i><\/p><p>Action: I believe that a borrowing framework for the IOT sector would deliver significant benefits.  My officials are in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to examine ways Institutes of Technology can be facilitated in developing on-campus student accommodation through addressing borrowing capacity and funding constraints.<\/p><p><i>(vii) The Department of Housing Planning Community and Local Government in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills will carry out an assessment of scope for provision of additional student accommodation on local authority or other publicly-owned lands with a view to maximising the potential for student accommodation provision on suitable sites as part of mixed developments.<\/i><\/p><p>Action: Work is ongoing in the Department of Housing, Planning Community and Local Government on developing a comprehensive database of publicly owned lands in key developable areas with a view to identifying land suitable for housing development.  The database of publicly owned lands will also inform the scope for provision of additional student accommodation.<\/p><p>In addition to these developments, I should point out that a number of our Higher Education Institutions have Student Accommodation projects ongoing, or in the pipeline, with a number of additional on-campus Student Accommodation bed-spaces coming online from September 2016.  Maynooth University have 296 new on-campus bed spaces, and UCD have 350 new on-campus bed spaces, which came on stream for the commencement of the 2016\/17 academic year.  Six other Higher Education Institutions are currently engaged in, or going through the planning phases for student accommodation projects, namely National University of Ireland Galway, Trinity College Dublin, University of Limerick, Dublin City University, University College Cork and Dublin Institute of Technology.<\/p><p>The Actions in the Plan in relation to Student Accommodation build on the report, Student Accommodation: Demand &amp;amp; Supply, which was published last year by the Minister for Education and Skills.  The full report can be accessed at:<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The previous Minister for Education and Skills introduced two immediate actions following the publication of this report.  Firstly, and as already pointed out, funding was provided by the HEA to the Union of Students' (USI) in Ireland to progress short-term solutions for students in need of accommodation.

The 2017\/18 school year will see a significant increase in teacher numbers (almost 4,700) in our schools compared to the 2015\/16 school year.<\/p><p>Latest statistics in relation to EU average class sizes refer to the 2013\/2014 academic year:<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Primary Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR)<\/th><th>Primary Average Class Size<\/th><th>Post Primary (Pupil Teacher Ratio) PTR<\/th><th>Post Primary Average Class Size<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Ireland<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>24.8<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>Not available<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EU 22 average<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>12<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500072#WRP02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commencement of Legislation","counter":593,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500072#WRP02300"},{"type":"question","counter":594,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[34765\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500072#WRP02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if there are remaining sections of the Teaching Council Act to be commenced; the timescale for commencing such sections; and the number of fitness-to-teach complaints received and processed to date since he commenced these provisions in July 2016.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[34767\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500072#WRP02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way in which he will address concerns that the Teaching Council, in the absence of a statutory complaints procedure for use at school level, will be expected to address complaints that are better resolved at local level and thus have fewer resources to deal with very serious complaints that may arise.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[34781\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500072#WRP02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans and the timescale in respect of complementing the fitness-to-teach provisions of the Teaching Council Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":597,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230, 232 and 244 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Teaching Council is the body with statutory authority for the regulation of the teaching profession.\u00a0One of\u00a0its key functions is to maintain the register of teachers in the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Fitness to Teach (Part 5) provisions of the Teaching\u00a0Council Acts were commenced on 25 July last in accordance with the commitment given in the Programme for a Partnership Government. This means that any person including a member of the public, an employer or a teacher may make a complaint to the Teaching Council about a registered teacher.<\/p>  <p>  A complaint may proceed to an\u00a0inquiry and, if deemed necessary,\u00a0sanctions ranging from advice, admonishment or censure to\u00a0suspension or removal from the register may be\u00a0imposed by the Council. The Deputy will appreciate that the fitness to teach process is independent of my Department and the Deputy should contact the Council directly if she is seeking information on the number of complaints received.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that, under Section 55 of the Teaching Council Act, the Council is obliged to submit an annual report of its activities and proceedings under the Act to me as Minister. Fitness to Teach was commenced on 25 July during the current reporting year. I look forward to the next annual report which will be due after 28 March next.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions of the Education Act, 1998 (Sections 24 and 28) are relevant to the new investigatory powers of the Teaching Council under\u00a0Part 5.\u00a0Section 24\u00a0as amended provides for inter alia the appointment, suspension and dismissal of teachers by boards of management in accordance with procedures agreed from time to time between the Minister, the patron, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union and staff association representing teachers or other staff as appropriate. The agreed procedures provide for two separate and independent strands which should be utilised in appropriate circumstances:<\/p>  <p>-  Procedures relating to professional competence issues <\/p>  <p>-  Procedures relating to work, conduct and matters other than professional competence <\/p>  <p>The procedures are set out for schools in Circulars \u00a060\/2009 and 0071\/2014 which are available on my Department's website. <\/p>  <p>  Schools, as teachers' employers,\u00a0will, therefore, continue\u00a0to manage\u00a0issues of teacher conduct or poor professional performance\u00a0under\u00a0Section 24 of the Education Act. Parental complaints in relation to teacher conduct or poor professional performance will, in general,\u00a0also continue to be investigated in the first instance by a school\u00a0under\u00a0the Section 24 procedures.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Teaching Council Act, the Teaching Council is obliged to pause its investigation of a complaint where a Section 24 process is in hand, except where there are good and sufficient reasons to do otherwise. I am advised by the Teaching Council that its Investigating Committee will take any Section 24 procedures into consideration as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government\u00a0provides, in addition, that the Government will introduce a charter for parents.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard, my Department has been working on draft legislation to provide for the replacement of the current Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998. The legislation will provide the statutory basis for ministerial guidelines which will form the framework for a Parents&rsquo; and Students&rsquo; Charter in every school, following consultation with parents, students, recognised school management bodies and staff associations representing teachers and other appropriate bodies. Revised local complaint and grievance procedures will be a key part of the Charter.<\/p>  <p>  I plan to make an announcement shortly on the draft legislation. <\/p>  <p>  With the Teaching Council (Amendment) Act 2015 having been commenced in full, the only remaining section of the principal act to be commenced is Section 39.

The introduction of the specification is part of\u00a0my Department's commemoration of 1916 and its commitment to education for sustainable development.\u00a0The subject\u00a0will be available to all schools from 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to enhancing the availability of technology in schools through the introduction of ICT\/Computer Science as a Leaving Certificate subject. As set out in the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is conducting a scoping exercise in this regard. Informed by this research, the NCCA will work on development of a draft subject specification in 2017, with a view to implementation in schools in September 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Physical Education is being developed by the NCCA as a full subject that can be assessed for the Leaving Certificate in a manner similar to other subjects. A specification for Leaving Certificate Physical Education is due to be finalised by the NCCA by the end of 2016. In addition, a Senior Cycle Physical Education Framework specification  has recently been completed by the NCCA. The\u00a0Framework\u00a0will assist\u00a0schools\u00a0to design a P.E. programme for those students who may not choose to take P.E. as part of their Leaving Certificate examination.\u00a0 These developments are\u00a0in keeping with the strong emphasis from my Department on promoting and encouraging Healthy Lifestyles for all students and commitments in the Programme for Partnership Government.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Action Plan for Education also includes commitments to finalise and implement additional subject specifications at Leaving Certificate level as resources permit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500073#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Educational Disadvantage","counter":627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500073#WRQ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":628,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[34778\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500073#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the new national action plan for educational inclusion will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":629,"content":"<p>It is my intention to publish a new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion before the end of this year.<\/p><p>A process to review of the DEIS Programme which began last year is now nearing completion.\u00a0 The review is looking at all aspects of DEIS, including the range and impact of different elements of the DEIS School Support Programme, the potential for innovation within and between schools and its scope for increased integration of services provided by other Departments and Agencies, in order to improve effectiveness.<\/p><p>A new assessment framework is also being developed using centrally held CSO and DES data for the identification of new schools for inclusion.

The designation of any performance in the certificate examinations as a' fail' ceased in 1968. <\/p>  <p>  The nature of curricular examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and the procedures currently in place for awarding grades are such that a certain amount of fluctuation in the grade distribution from year to year is to be expected. Grade distributions are also affected significantly by the proportion of candidates who opt to take the examination at each level. In particular, if the proportion of candidates opting for Higher level increases, the candidates making this move will tend to be those who were towards the higher-achieving end of the Ordinary level distribution and will tend to fall at the lower-achieving end of the Higher level distribution. This will obviously affect the grade distribution at both levels. Influenced by the combined effect of syllabus change in mathematics,\u00a0 known as Project Maths, and the introduction by the Higher Education Institutions of 'bonus points' for Higher level mathematics, the number of students in recent years presenting for Higher level in Leaving Certificate Mathematics examinations has increased significantly, from 15.8% in 2011 to 28% in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  During the standard-setting process that happens as part of the marking process each year, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) takes account of these and any other relevant factors in the course of satisfying itself that the distribution of grades awarded is appropriate and that it accurately reflects the performance of the candidates in comparison to the achievement standards envisaged when the syllabus was designed.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of a significant migration of mathematics candidates from Ordinary to Higher level, it may be noted that a similar absolute number of candidates awarded E, F or no grade at Ordinary level will inevitably be manifested as a higher percentage, since the total number of candidates at this level has reduced.<\/p>  <p>  The number of candidates who failed to achieve at least a D3 grade at any level of the mathematics examination in 2016, while marginally higher than in the last three or four years, is very similar to the number in the years before that (2009 to 2011, for example). In the context of the factors mentioned above, there is nothing especially unusual about the grade distribution in mathematics for 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the current syllabus change in mathematics, there has been a deliberate attempt to increase the emphasis on higher-order thinking skills, including interpretation, problem solving, and dealing with the unfamiliar. These are skills that students find difficult to master and teachers find difficult to instil in students. The syllabus expectations are ambitious at all levels. <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) will be undertaking a review of the Project Maths initiative, now that the full implementation of all phases of the curricular change is complete. By this time students will have been through the new maths cycle a few times and the NCCA will have good information on which to base the assessment of its impact, especially on the learning of under-achievers. I have asked the State Examinations Commission to ensure that any lessons that can be learned from candidate performance in recent examinations, and the 2016 examination in particular, be fed into that review process. The Project Maths Implementation Support Group, an industry-education partnership set up by my Department, including third level bodies, Engineers Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, will also be able to provide their considered opinions to this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500074#WRR01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Institutes of Technology","counter":667,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500074#WRR01150"},{"type":"question","counter":668,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[34793\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500074#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on the drop-out rate in third level institute of technology courses; the measures his Department propose to remedy the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":669,"content":"<p>In line with the overall mission of higher education in Ireland there has been a steady increase in student enrolments over recent years. \u00a0The most recent report by the HEA on retention and progression, entitled 'A Study of Progression in Higher Education 2012\/13 TO 2013\/14', is available on the HEA website, www.hea.ie. \u00a0This is the fourth in a series of progression analysis released by the HEA and examines those 1st year undergraduate new entrants enrolled in the academic year 2012\/13 and traces them to the following academic year 2013\/14.\u00a0 The report gives an in-depth analysis of the non-progression rates by NFQ level, sector, discipline, gender, age, nationality and socio-economic group. \u00a0There are many factors identified as influencing the likelihood of progression such as gender, age at commencement, prior educational attainment, nationality and socio-economic grouping.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The report shows that 84% of full-time undergraduate new entrants in 2012\/13 progressed to their second year of study in 2013\/14.\u00a0 The report demonstrates that the overall new entrant non-progression rate was 15% in 2007\/08 and has remained constant at 16% from 2010\/11 to 2012\/13. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The rates of non-progression in 2012\/13 varied within and between sectors ranging from 26% and 28% at levels 6 and 7 to 17%, 11% and 6% at level 8 in universities, institutes of technology and colleges respectively.\u00a0 Further work will be done to see how students can best be supported to continue on their course or transfer to another programme.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The HEA through the System Performance and Strategic Dialogue process also monitor progression rates within the institutions on an annual basis. Institutes report on retention measures in place within their institutes to combat high non-progression rates. The HEA funds retention initiatives in Computer Science disciplines in higher education institutions through the Information Technology Investment Fund.\u00a0 In 2015 these initiatives included additional classes, attendance mentoring, teaching and learning initiatives, student support sessions, buddy practical&rsquo;s and maths enabling courses. In 2016 the National Forum for Teaching and Learning established an ICT Retention Scoping Group to examine ways in which students could be enabled to complete ICT courses.\u00a0 The group working with practitioners and industry are examining areas such as career guidance, pathways, provision and pedagogy. <\/p>  <p>  One of the key objectives of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 (&lsquo;National Access Plan&rsquo;) is to address the issue of non-completion within higher education institutions, for those in under-represented target groups. The Plan also commits to the further development of mechanisms to track the progression, retention and student experience of target groups. The target student groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first time mature student entrants and students with disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  To support the implementation of these objectives, a Working Group is being established to consider the issues contributing to the non-completion of target groups in the National Access Plan and to produce recommendations for policy and practice. The group is being convened by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and will include representatives of relevant stakeholders. \u00a0\u00a0Considerations of members will be informed by recent, qualitative research by the National Forum for Teaching and Learning on the reasons why students leave higher education (National Forum for Teaching and Learning, 2015).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500074#WRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Data","counter":670,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500074#WRR01350"},{"type":"question","counter":671,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[34794\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500074#WRR01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on the lack of apprenticeships suitable for a number of employment vacancies, such as chefs and in the hospitality sector generally, to upskill young unemployed workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":672,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Apprenticeship Council was established in early 2014 to oversee the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas.

network of Special Needs Organisers for determining the appropriate staffing levels in Special schools. The NCSE operates within my Department's policy in allocating this support. <\/p><p>Circular 0042\/2011 provides information to schools regarding the staffing arrangements which apply in Special schools. The Circular sets out that special schools are staffed based on their pupil profiles and the disability category of the pupils enrolled, as opposed to being based principally on school designation. Staffing levels therefore reflect the complexity of needs that exist within schools rather than being determined solely by a school's designation, in recognition that many Special schools enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations. <\/p><p>In determining the staffing allocation for schools, the NCSE takes into account up-to-date enrolment and pupil profile information. School staffing schedules are reviewed and updated each year by the NCSE. As such, the profile of Special school pupil populations are aligned with appropriate staffing allocations. <\/p><p>Staffing arrangements for special schools are in line with policy advice provided by the NCSE, which did not recommend alteration to staffing ratios established under the Report of the Special Education Review Committee (SERC).<\/p><p>In addition, as outlined in the SERC Report, administrative principals should be recognised in all special schools at the point at which the sixth teacher (i.e. the fifth assistant teacher) is about to be appointed. <\/p><p>There are no plans to deviate from these arrangements for special schools that do not meet the criteria set out above.<\/p><p>The school to which the Deputy refers, having a staffing of 1 principal and 3 assistant teachers, is not eligible for an administrative principal post at this point in time as the school does not meet the qualifying criteria.<\/p><p>I am aware of the workload and the pressures on teaching Principals.  In this regard, my Department has provided release days for teaching principals to assist them in fulfilling their Principal duties. Circular 25\/02 which is available on my Department's website outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year. <\/p><p>Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal. Under the current arrangements the number of days that principal teachers may take as release time in each school year ranges between 14 and 22 days depending on the size of the school. My Department provides capitation funding to all recognised primary schools.  The amount of grant paid to an individual primary school for capitation and ancillary services is determined by the school&rsquo;s enrolment, subject to a minimum grant for both capitation and ancillary services in respect of schools with enrolments up to 60, and a maximum ancillary services grant in the case of schools with enrolments of 500 or more.<\/p><p>Boards of Management have autonomy on how they use and prioritise that funding to meet their day to day running costs including for the provision of secretarial services, to assist with school administration.<\/p><p>The detailed arrangements are set out in Circular 0076\/2015 that was published in December 2015 on my Departments website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500074#WRR02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Staff","counter":683,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500074#WRR02250"},{"type":"question","counter":684,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[34818\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500074#WRR02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps taken by his Department to implement the recommendations of the Cush report; the number of academic staff with more than two years' service who have been given permanent and pensionable contracts since 2009 and the grade of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":685,"content":"<p>The Report of the Chair of the Expert Group on Fixed Term and Part-Time issues in Lecturing in Ireland was published in July 2016 and the Report contains a number of recommendations that will assist in addressing concerns raised about the level of part-time and fixed-term employment in lecturing\u00a0in the third level sector.

The system of making retrospective declarations had become a means of evasion of motor tax estimated to have cost some &euro;50m annually.<\/p><p>The Act provides that a vehicle can be declared off the road for a minimum period of three months and a maximum period of twelve months.  Where the owner of a vehicle wishes to make a declaration of non-use, he or she must do so during the final month of an existing tax disc or a previously made declaration of non-use.  The declaration can be made on-line at <i>www.motortax.ie<\/i><i><font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font><\/i>or through the local motor tax office.  The National Vehicle and Driver File, under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, issues renewal notices at the beginning of the final month of tax or a previously made declaration of non-use to remind motorists that the vehicle must be taxed or declared off the road for a further period.  <\/p><p>Where a declaration of non-use is not made in the final month of a tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use, a vehicle must be taxed for the minimum period provided for in motor tax legislation for the category of vehicle concerned.

In particular, engaging with banks and investment companies in respect of their vacant\/available property portfolios, which normally span a number of local authority jurisdictions, benefits from a national approach.  In that context, the Housing Agency currently acts as a central co-ordination body at national level for banks\/investors to interact with.  This activity began in early 2015 and to date has yielded 174 properties across 29 local authorities at a total value of over &euro;25m. <\/p>  <p>  In a further development of this activity, a new acquisitions initiative was provided for in Rebuilding Ireland (Action 5.6), under which the Housing Agency is to be provided directly with capital funding with the specific focus of engaging with banks and investment companies to acquire properties for social housing nationally, thereby increasing social housing delivery.  Under this acquisitions programme, the Agency will use a rotating fund of &euro;70m to acquire vacant properties from banks and private equity investment funds in areas with high levels of social housing demand.  In doing this, the Agency will work in close consultation with local authorities to ensure that suitable properties are only purchased in areas where there is a demand for social housing.  It is estimated that this mechanism, implementation of which is already underway, will deliver some 1,600 units over the period to 2020.  Details of the progress under this initiative will be outlined in future Rebuilding Ireland quarterly progress reports.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of dealing with vacant dwellings generally, Action 5.1 of Rebuilding Ireland undertakes to develop a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy by early 2017.  To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for co-ordinating the development of the Strategy, has established a working group to inform the Strategy, with senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself.  It has met twice so far.  A number of local authorities have commenced, or are planning to commence, pilot programmes to identify vacant homes and bring them back into use; these pilot programmes will inform the Strategy.  In addition, the Strategy will be informed by international best practice and experience, and research is being undertaken in this area.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500076#WRT02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Principal Private Residence Charge Data","counter":744,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500076#WRT02500"},{"type":"question","counter":745,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[34548\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500076#WRT02600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the liability due by persons who have not paid the non-principal private residence charge to date; the amount due for each year since it was introduced in 2009; the amounts due in respect of each year and the amount increased as a result of non-payment adding up to a figure of &euro;7,230 which may be due in these cases; if the figure will increase in the future; the number of cases in which fines of this nature are due to be collected; if this is being followed up; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":746,"content":"<p>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, provides the legislative basis for the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge.

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, and who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under this scheme.  Under the scheme, entitlement is calculated by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at 85% of the full rate.  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), which amounts to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration in the first half of the New Year.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that a pensioner can already claim a State pension contributory and continue in employment.  In developing the TCA my officials are also examining flexibility options in both contributing to and drawing down State pension contributory.  These include deferment of pension and\/or payment of further reckonable PRSI contributions after State pension age.  Decisions on whether and how to include these options will depend on a balance between costs, benefits for pensioners, demand for the options and practicality of administration. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that the changes are announced well in advance of introduction, to enable those affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500084#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobPath Implementation","counter":1012,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500084#WRBB00713"},{"type":"question","counter":1013,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[34816\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500084#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons, by county, that have had their payments reduced or ceased as a result of failure to comply with the requirements of the JobPath scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In addition, at least three fraud and error surveys of Departmental schemes are conducted annually to assess the quality of claim processing and fraud detection.

It formerly operated within the auspices of the Office of the Attorney General and is now contained within the Government Reform Unit of my Department.  Its purpose is to modernise and simplify the Statute book by removing spent and obsolete pieces of legislation, thereby reducing its size and thus making it more understandable and accessible to those who use it.  There has been a particular need for such revision in Ireland because our unique legislative past has left us with a complex stock of legislation, with enactments from the Parliaments of Ireland, England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom as well as our own Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the Oireachtas has passed five Statute Law Revision Acts as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - The Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act 2005, which repealed a selection of pre-1922 statutes;<\/p>  <p>  - The Statute Law Revision Act 2007, which was a comprehensive revision of pre-1922 Public General Acts;<\/p>  <p>  - The Statute Law Revision Act 2009, which revised all Private Acts up to and including 1750 and all Local and Personal Acts up to and including 1850;<\/p>  <p>  - The Statute Law Revision Act 2012, which revised all Private Acts from 1750 to 1922 and all Local and Personal Acts from 1850 to 1922; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Statute Law Revision Act 2015, which revoked Secondary Instruments made before 1 January 1821.<\/p>  <p>  A sixth Statute Law Revision Bill, covering primary legislation enacted between 1922 and 1950, is currently progressing through the Houses.<\/p>  <p>  The progress we have made with the Statute Law Revision Programme has been considerable.  To date, over 60,000 pieces of legislation have been either expressly or implicitly repealed under the programme.  Collectively this is the most extensive set of repealing measures in the history of the State and the most extensive set of statute law revision measures ever enacted anywhere in the world.  I propose, however, in view of the progress made, to pause the Statute Law Revision Programme at this time in order that my Department can progress other priorities.<\/p>  <p>  Common law will continue to constitute the basis of the legal system of Ireland and neither the Statute Law Revision Programme nor Brexit have any bearing on this.

Targeted tree planning has been carried out at the site - originally a plantation which had become neglected over the past 25 years - as part of a ten year management plan for the woodland to encourage natural regeneration.  The activities undertaken were carried out under license from the Forest Service and the works have been assessed and approved by my Department.  The felling included a thinning out process to encourage continuous woodland cover and natural regeneration.  Large numbers of invasive species such as Rhododendron, Sycamore and Laurel had become well established within the woodland.  These species were rampant in the areas selected for thinning.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the conditions agreed to secure the thinning license for the woods, the entity involved agreed to carry out the removal of all invasive species from the selected area.  In addition, standing dead wood and veteran trees were selected for retention for conservation purposes.<\/p>  <p>  From the selected thinning, some Oak were removed, as were all Sycamore, most Beech, some Ash, all Rhododendron and all Laurel, as well as Willow from dry areas only, with wet Willow being left in situ.  Most Oak trees selected were between 60-80 years old, with the occasional older tree.  Contrary to some reports, I am advised that there were no 400 year old Oak trees on the site.<\/p>  <p>  Trees were removed to allow natural regeneration of the Oak woodland, to promote continuous woodland cover and to help in the conservation of this important site.  The removal of the alien species and the thinning of the woodland assist in this management by allowing the light to reach the forest floor, encouraging the natural regrowth of the woodland.  This had not happened over the last 25 years, so no natural regeneration had occurred.<\/p>  <p>  Expert personnel from my Department have met the personnel involved to walk the site and assess the works carried out to date.  My Department remains satisfied that the work was carried out in accordance to the conditions set out in the thinning\/felling license.

It is my objective to have this legislation prepared and brought before the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.

The cost which will be incurred on a monthly basis will ultimately depend on the number of children encompassed by the measure whose parents or guardians apply for a medical card, as well as the profile of service usage they incur.

Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  <\/p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are terminally ill.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility.  These cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500090#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500090#WRHH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1247,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[34540\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500090#WRHH01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the waiting times for inpatient and outpatient neurology appointments at each hospital across the seven hospital groups, in tabular form; if he will provide this information specifically regarding those waiting for three months, six months, nine months, 12 months or more than 12 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health. The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. <\/p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests. NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  <\/p>  <p>  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide. In Ireland over 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Aluminium has been used in vaccines for many decades to improve the body's response to vaccination. It is a component of Gardasil and several other vaccines. The World Health Organisation's (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine safety (an expert clinical and scientific advisory body) has concluded that there is no evidence of a health risk from aluminium-containing vaccines. <\/p>  <p>  The safety of the aluminium adjuvant used in Gardasil has been established in clinical studies and the level of aluminium present is tightly controlled as part of the quality control testing of the vaccine.  Gardasil which contains amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulphate adjuvant was tested in nonclinical safety assessment studies where daily monitoring for physical signs did not reveal any notable effects on any physiological function. In addition, the safety of Gardasil was tested in human clinical studies and no signs of concern were identified. Apart from the expected immune response and local injection site reactions, there was no evidence of systemic effects (such as effects on CNS, respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal systems) caused by HPV L1 VLP vaccines such as Gardasil from study data and there is no data to suggest that Gardasil crosses the blood brain barrier.  The pharmacological evaluation of Gardasil focused on the evaluation of primary pharmacodynamics (i.e. immunogenicity) as the vaccine did not show any effects apart from the expected immune response.  <\/p>  <p>  The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is a decentralised agency of the European Union responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU.  It would not be appropriate to comment on data submitted by manufacturers of a medicinal product to the EMA as part of their market authorisation processes or monitoring of its safety following authorisation for use.<\/p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use. The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level. In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports of suspected adverse reactions submitted to the HPRA are reviewed and followed up as necessary to ensure all relevant information is available, prior to onward reporting to relevant stakeholders, including the EMA. At EU level, regulators continuously monitor this cumulative reporting experience as part of the ongoing assessment of the safety of HPV vaccines.  In addition, pharmaceutical companies are obliged, as a condition of the authorisation to market a medicine, to submit reports of adverse reactions received directly, to the HPRA.  In accordance with its reporting obligations, the HPRA provides anonymised details of reports received to the EMA, the WHO and to the relevant pharmaceutical companies. The fact that a suspected adverse reaction has been reported does not necessarily mean that the medicine has caused the observed effect, which may have also been caused by the condition being treated, a new condition the patient developed, or by another medicine that the patient is taking.  Further data are usually needed to complete the picture.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women. It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition. It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services. The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.  <\/p>  <p>  I encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500091#WRJJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":1301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500092#WRKK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1302,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[34599\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500092#WRKK00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide home help hours for a person (details supplied) in order for the person to be able to remain at home; if he will take into consideration that this is a high dependency case in view of the medical circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1303,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500092#WRKK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500092#WRKK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1305,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[34609\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500092#WRKK00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite a medical card application in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1306,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

However, with the exception of Sativex, cannabis-based preparations are not currently authorised as medicines in Ireland.  Cannabis has not gone through the normal regulatory procedures for medicines which are designed to protect patients and ensure treatments are supported by good evidence of their safety and efficacy. <\/p>  <p>  I am however committed to urgently reviewing policy on medicinal cannabis.  I have requested the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) to provide me with expert advice on the matter.  The HPRA&rsquo;s statutory role is to protect and enhance human health by regulating medicines and other health products and it has the necessary clinical and scientific expertise to provide advice on this issue.  I have asked the HPRA to report on recent developments in the use of medicinal cannabis in other countries including an overview of emerging research.  This report may also propose changes to Irish legislation in relation to the use of medicinal cannabis.<\/p>  <p>  Separately the Oireachtas Health Committee will also start to examine the issue of medicinal cannabis later this month.  I hope to receive the report from the HPRA and the output from the Oireachtas Health Committee early in the new year and I will then be in a position to consider future policy and progress any legislative changes that may be recommended.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, it must be emphasised that treatment options for a particular condition are a matter to be discussed between a patient, their carer and their doctor in the first instance.  There are, for example, cannabis-based preparations intended for the treatment of certain types of epilepsy which are currently undergoing clinical trials.  It may be possible for patients to access these products on an individual basis, but this is something for discussion with the treating doctor.<\/p>  <p>  Cannabis-based preparations are strictly controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  It is open for an Irish registered doctor to apply for a licence for such preparations for an individual, named-patient.  Such applications will be considered on a case by case basis.  The appropriateness of any particular treatment is a matter between the patient and their doctor.  It would be entirely inappropriate for me, as Minister for Health, to involve myself in this process.  My understanding is that many doctors would be quite cautious about recommending a cannabis-based treatment for a patient, in the absence of the robust clinical evidence which underpins authorised medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500099#WRRR04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Recruitment","counter":1611,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500100#WRSS00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1612,"qnumday":600,"qnumall":"[35012\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500100#WRSS00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the detail of the targeting methods being utilised and the timeframe envisaged in order to meet the required staffing levels to ensure the new emergency department in University Hospital Limerick, Dooradoyle, is open by or prior to May 2017.

In relation to the first two licences, as the area proposed for felling intersected with a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and Special Protection Area (SPA), the views of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) were sought.<\/p><p>The area covered by the third licence lies outside of the SAC and SPA and involved thinning.  In these situations, referral to NPWS is at the discretion of the Forest Service, and it was deemed unnecessary in this case.<\/p><p>In March 2016, concerns about the felling were raised with the Department and at the request of the Forest Service operations ceased on site for the areas relating to the second and third licence.  At that time, felling within the first licence area had been completed.  Following discussions with the contractor and further site assessments by the Forest Service, NPWS and an ornithologist engaged by the operator, the Forest Service was satisfied that the operations were appropriate and that the licenses issued were in keeping with agreed procedures.  The request to cease operations was lifted on 12<sup>th<\/sup>April, conditional upon stated requirements.  A speedy resumption and completion of the felling work was sought in order to have the work completed before possible nesting began.  On 11<sup>th<\/sup>May, work on the site ceased and was scheduled to resume at the end of the Summer.<\/p><p>A basis for lifting the request to cease operations on the 12<sup>th<\/sup>April was the commitment of the contractor to retain sequoia onsite within the area of the second licence (unless overriding health and safety concerns arose).

In the opinion of the Forest Service Inspector the three sequoia appeared to have been felled in spring or very early summer and it appeared that the felled sequoia were quite likely to have been dominated by larger sequoias, as there continues to be a closed canopy following the removal of the trees.  Following this inspection, the contractor was contacted and he explained that three small sequoias were felled for the following reasons; <\/p><p>-  They were suppressed by the dominant sequoia overhead and therefore had little or no living crown remaining;<\/p><p>-  They were either dead or dying;<\/p><p>-  They represented a health and safety risk.<\/p><p>The Forest Service has not received any complaint regarding the felling of oak on this site.

The policy is based on an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. <\/p>  <p>  Through the deployment of innovative and efficient practices at farm level, combined with the application of emerging scientific knowledge, Ireland can take the necessary steps towards addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions, including methane, in the Irish agriculture sector.

It should be noted that there has never been a national waiver scheme for household waste collection.  During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria.  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then, for only a limited time.  The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired.  In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price. However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis.  With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste.  Waste collection\u00a0is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between the service provider and customer and the range of services and fees offered vary amongst providers and across the country.\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it became increasingly apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.<\/p>  <p>  A mandatory pay-by-weight charging structure for household waste collection was due to be introduced in mid-2016.

Notwithstanding the above, as previously stated, a review of the pricing structures that\u00a0households are charged for the collection of waste, with a focus on encouraging households to prevent, separate and recycle waste and to reduce residual waste going to landfills, is due to be completed by July next year.

Neither my Department nor the Commission for Communications Regulation, the independent market regulator, have statutory authority to oblige any particular network provider to invest in the provision of upgraded broadband services. <\/p><p>My Department is however actively monitoring the deployment plans in the BLUE area.\u00a0\u00a0Direct feedback from consumers is important and\u00a0if customers in Cootehill County Cavan cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at <i>broadband@dccae.gov.ie<\/i>, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.\u00a0 If\u00a0 investment from commercial operators is not forthcoming, the Department has reserved the right to include the premises in question as part of the procurement process. <\/p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising\u00a0over 750,000 premises including over 24,000 premises in County Cavan, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. <\/p><p>The\u00a0procurement process commenced in December 2015.  In July, 3 consortia were shortlisted as bidders and invited to participate in formal dialogue.  All three bidders involved in dialogue are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) network solution to connect rural Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0This means that consumers in rural Ireland could have access to services of up to 1,000 megabits per second, with businesses availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.  It will involve the building of a new network in rural Ireland, spanning the equivalent of up to 100,000km of road. <\/p><p>Through this combination of commercial investment by telecoms operators, and the State Intervention, the National Broadband Plan aims to deal conclusively with Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500104#WRWW02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1790,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500104#WRWW02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1791,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[34979\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500104#WRWW02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to continue to provide funding for a project (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1792,"content":"<p>The Protecting Uplands &amp;amp; Rural Environments (PURE) Project was established on a pilot basis in January 2006 to combat the escalating problem of fly-tipping and small scale illegal dumping in the scenic area encompassed by the Wicklow and Dublin Uplands.

","asker":"1355","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1798,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 668 to 670, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) is the state agency responsible for the protection, management and conservation of Ireland's inland fisheries and sea angling resources.  IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis as each of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers has its own genetically unique stock of salmon.<\/p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role by a statutorily independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for Salmon comprising scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (Northern Ireland), and\u00a0other State bodies and third level institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The SSC estimates the number of salmon likely to return to each river in the next fishing season based on estimates of salmon runs over the most recent five years.  Each river has an individual conservation limit which is essentially the number of salmon required to spawn to maintain a healthy population.  If the estimate of returning salmon is above this limit then salmon from that individually genetic river population may be harvested commercially or by rod and line.<\/p>  <p>  The harvest of salmon is restricted to those river stocks that are meeting their conservation limits.  Fisheries are only considered in rivers where the estimated returns are above the conservation limit for the river.  I am advised by IFI that a Risk Analysis is undertaken on any estimate of returns expected to be above the conservation limit.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the River Slaney,\u00a0fish counter data is used to estimate the salmon run.  IFI has confirmed that the estimate of returning salmon in 2015 was below the individual conservation limit for the river Slaney and, using fish counter data averaged over the past five years,\u00a0no surplus of salmon was available for 2016. I am advised that the data from all counters is verified on an annual basis.  I am happy to ask IFI to brief the Deputy on the methodologies used around counter technology, and\u00a0to provide the latest verified counter figures.<\/p>  <p>  The salmon assessment methodologies used in Ireland are considered best practice internationally, with many other countries moving towards the development of similar scientific assessment models for salmon stock conservation.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan (EMP) was reviewed in 2012 and again in 2015 in line with EU requirements. IFI carried out a comprehensive public consultation process as part of the both reviews.  Based on management advice from IFI, and having considered all aspects of their report, the existing conservation measures in Ireland&rsquo;s EMP remain in place up to mid-2018.  Conservation of Eel Fishing Bye-law No. C.S. 319, 2015 prohibits fishing for eel, or possessing or selling eel caught in a river in the State and ceases up to 30 June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) for 2016 (published October 2015) is that &ldquo;the status of eel remains critical and that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to &ndash; or kept as close to &ndash; zero as possible.&rdquo;  There is no change in the perception of the status of the stock as being critically endangered.<\/p>  <p>  A new collaborative research initiative, involving\u00a0IFI scientists and\u00a0former eel fishermen to further develop national knowledge of the species and its medium to longer term potential for recovery, is underway.  It is intended that the scientific fishery is to be undertaken for three years commencing in 2016 to increase data and knowledge ahead of further review of eel management measures in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  While I recognise fully the difficulty facing eel fishermen, there is no property right attaching to public eel licences and currently there are no plans to introduce a hardship scheme as outlined by the Deputy, given that the closure of the fishery\u00a0was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500105#WRXX00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":1800,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500105#WRXX00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traffic Data","counter":1799,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500105#WRXX00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1800,"qnumday":671,"qnumall":"[34433\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500105#WRXX00800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a traffic survey of the N11 has been conducted; if so, the results of that survey; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1230","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1801,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.

This year's fares determinations mean that approximately 75% of passengers will see no increase in their fares next year.<\/p>  <p>  Since it assumed its powers in this area, the NTA has sought to simplify what was an extremely complicated and cumbersome fares system and introduce a more logical and fair distance based model.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to rail, an examination of approximately 1,200 Origin and Destination station pairs concluded that fares between some pairs were set particularly low for various historic, commercial and operational reasons and were not in line with the fares other passengers are paying for a similar distance journey.  The NTA has been adjusting fares across the rail network in recent years in order to remove these anomalies.<\/p>  <p>  This year the final 261 station pairs were examined with the vast majority seeing a decrease in their fares for next year as a result.<\/p>  <p>  However, inevitably a small number, 36 station pairs to be exact or around 3% of the total number of possible pairs, will see a fare increase.  This is as a result of the previously unfair level of fares when compared with other station pairs across the broader network.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of Leixlip, the trip to Dublin Pearse has been moved from zone 3 to zone 4.  A single adult Leap fare will now cost &euro;2.93 as opposed to &euro;2.46.  There is no change to the cost of a single fare between Maynooth and the City Centre.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously I can understand that passengers at Leixlip will be disappointed at such a change; however, the overall impact of these changes is that all passengers within the Short Hop Zone are now paying the same fare for the same distance from 1 December next and that is in line with the overall strategy being pursued by the NTA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500105#WRXX04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Fairs","counter":1836,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500106#WRYY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1837,"qnumday":683,"qnumall":"[34937\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111500106#WRYY00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to attract the Web Summit to return here in view of the hugely successful web summit in Portugal recently and considering that this event was originally held in Dublin; if he has held any discussions with the promoters in terms of the supports that can be provided to facilitate such a return; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
