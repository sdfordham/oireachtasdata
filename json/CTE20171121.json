As a nation, we have a strong affinity not just with racing but also with the social scene at its core.<\/p><p> One of the overarching objectives of the Government is to ensure that the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve maximum potential and, in so doing, contribute to economic and social development across a wide geographic swathe of the country.  Successive Governments have staunchly supported these industries through legislation and policy initiatives over a long period.  The horse and greyhound racing industries have a huge geographic spread and they deliver to the local economy like few others.<\/p><p> These industries receive financial support from the State through the horse and greyhound racing fund under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  My Department makes payments from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  In the period 2001 to date, a total of &euro;1.12 billion has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund provided under the relevant regulations has, therefore, been reached.  Exchequer funding provided from the fund is pivotal to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.  To give effect to the provisions of budget 2018, this cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulation.<\/p><p> The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of budget 2018, include an allocation of &euro;80 million for the horse and greyhound racing fund.  This will be distributed in accordance with section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, with 80% or &euro;64 million going to Horse Racing Ireland and 20% or &euro;16 million going to Bord na gCon.  To allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2018, it is necessary to comply with the technical requirements under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act to increase the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the horse and greyhound racing fund by &euro;80 million to &euro;1.2 billion.  This is achieved by way of the regulations submitted to the committee today.  The aggregate limit on the horse and greyhound racing fund was increased in this manner in 2004 and in 2009 to 2016, inclusive.<\/p><p> The recent Deloitte report commissioned by HRI indicates that the total direct and stimulated expenditure of the Irish breeding and racing industry is estimated at &euro;1.84 billion in 2016.  The report indicates the core industry comprises &euro;914 million of this with secondary expenditure making up the remaining &euro;927 million.  In addition, an estimated 15,200 jobs are at the core of the racing and breeding industry or in directly related industries.<\/p><p> The achievements of Irish-bred and Irish-trained horses abroad and the enduring influence of Irish-born jockeys and stable staff underscore Ireland's global prominence.  The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is competitive at a global level despite other major racing nations having far larger populations and economies.  The horse and greyhound racing fund has been pivotal in shaping the destiny of this dynamic industry.  It is noteworthy that the Irish thoroughbred breeding industry has developed from an essentially amateur cottage industry pre-1969 to a position in which Ireland now is one of the leading bloodstock producing nations in the world.  The industry produces close to half of all thoroughbreds in Europe.  We hold the distinguished position of being the third-highest producer of foals coupled with having the third-highest number of active brood mares in the world.<\/p><p> Government funding is crucial to maintain and build on our position as one of the world's leading breeding and racing nations.  Government funding of this industry is an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for this investment leading to a flow of income right through the economy.  Support for certain strategic industries is important for future economic growth and can provide widespread benefits for our society and economy.<\/p><p> The greyhound industry is a significant industry for Ireland.  It has been embedded in Irish society for decades and is an important activity from an economic, social and cultural perspective.  It provides and supports considerable employment directly and indirectly throughout the country.  The Irish greyhound sector has come through challenging times during the economic recession but it continues to make a significant economic and financial contribution to the Irish economy, especially at local level.  The Bord na gCon annual reports indicate that, despite a severe recession, the industry is recovering and showed an increase in operating surplus in 2015 and 2016.  The industry remains significant for the economy and has the potential to grow with the necessary investment in facilities and support infrastructure.  Funds generated from racing are re-invested in the industry through contributions to prize money and grants to various bodies involved in the greyhound racing and breeding sector, as well as promotion of greyhound welfare and the regulation of the industry.  The funding provided to the greyhound racing sector helps to sustain a long-standing tradition as the industry is part of the social fabric of our country.  This funding underpins economic activity in what are, in many instances, less affluent regions of the country.  It has also contributed significantly to the improved facilities now available at greyhound tracks throughout Ireland.  Greyhound racing is an activity that is inextricably linked to the farming community.  While it is undoubtedly part of the fabric of rural Ireland, it also enjoys a strong urban base.<\/p><p> The advent of new technologies and business models has challenged the Government to re-evaluate the funding mechanisms for the industry.  As part of its overall commitment to the industry, the Government has addressed, through legislation, the anomaly whereby remote and online betting operators were outside the tax net.  The Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 came into force on 15 April 2015.  The Act brings betting exchanges and Internet and mobile betting providers within the scope of the existing licensing regime and extends the existing 1% turnover tax on land-based bookmaking activities to online and mobile bookmakers.  The Act also means that a 15% commission tax for betting exchanges has been implemented.  These measures have had a positive effect on revenue streams with significant increases being realised.  It is worth noting that betting tax has increased from a total of &euro;31 million for 2015 to &euro;51 million in 2016.<\/p><p> The Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016, which gives effect to the recommendations in the Indecon report, came into force on 8 February 2016 with certain sections commenced on 9 March 2016 and January 2017.  The Act introduced a range of improvements in governance and accountability arrangements, many of which derive from recommendations made by Indecon International Economic Consultants following a review of the sector.  Indecon International Economic Consultants was also commissioned to conduct a review of certain matters relating to Bord na gCon to assess the suitability of the legal, governance and regulatory framework supporting the greyhound industry and to identify opportunities to maximise its commercial income.<\/p><p> In response to the recommendations made in the Indecon and Morris reports, as well as in the report prepared by this committee, chaired at the time by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Doyle, I have introduced a draft general scheme of the greyhound industry Bill.  The Bill will address the governance of Bord na gCon.  It will strengthen regulatory controls in the industry.  It will modernise sanctions and improve integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector.  As members are aware, the draft general scheme has progressed through the pre-legislative scrutiny phase and a memorandum will go to Government in the coming weeks requesting approval to publish the updated general scheme and to submit it to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.  In this regard, I wish to extend my thanks to the members of the committee for their thorough and thoughtful deliberations during the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I believe the Bill will bolster the Irish greyhound industry, enable it to deal with existing challenges and maximise its future potential.<\/p><p> I am sure we are all in agreement that more balanced regional economic growth is desirable and this is a key priority for Government.  In this context, these industries should be given recognition for the considerable contribution they make to rural economic activity and employment.  Their activities are spread throughout rural areas and can be credited with enhancing the social fabric of rural Ireland.  Local stadia are a focal point for supporting economic, social and cultural needs.  Point-to-point meetings take place at 70 locations throughout the island, contributing significantly to many rural communities.<\/p><p> Horse and greyhound racing compete in a number of different economic arenas, including sport and hospitality and in a diverse betting arena.  Therefore, their collective reach throughout the economy is extensive and significant, reaching almost every county.  The important contribution made by the horse and greyhound racing fund since its inception in 2001 has been vital to ensuring that these industries can continue to invest in infrastructure, whether through continuing the programme of capital investment in racecourses, ensuring prize money remains competitive or education and development of their skilled workforces.<\/p><p> Section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 provides that a draft of these regulations be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft be passed by each House before the regulations are made by the Minister.  Accordingly, I seek the support of all committee members to ensure that Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon receive the funding provided for in budget 2018 and that the important role played by these industries, as well as the economic activity generated by them, are sustained in future.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the contribution that members of this committee have made to the debate on the future of these critically important industries.  I commend these regulations to the committee and I look forward to discussing any matters arising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112100002#N00500","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511281800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It is well known that I am chairman of Kilbeggan Racecourse, which is one of the small racecourses.  As I am heavily involved, I am very much aware of how important this fund is for the sustainability of the smaller tracks and training yards that generate employment and create income in rural areas.  The Minister states that one must speculate to accumulate.  The investment of &euro;80 million in the industry returns to the State almost threefold.  With that in mind, I would be touting for an increase in what is being spent on the industries in order to drive them forward and bring them on to the next level.  There is an old saying that the day one stops going forward is the day that one starts going back.<\/p> <p>  The Minister also referred to the betting tax and the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015.  The gap was almost bridged by a &euro;51 million intake in 2016 as opposed to an output of &euro;80 million.  I would like to know why the rates of turnover tax for offshore and online betting were not considered in the 2017 budget.  This would bring us up to - and would probably surpass - the &euro;80 million and the additional moneys could be reinvested in the industry as per the provisions of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  I know that the tax rate in France is far higher and that all the money taken in is reinvested in the industry at no net cost to the state.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on the possibility of bridging the gap and increasing the spend through increased taxation.<\/p> <p>  Horse racing comes under agriculture, hence the Minister's presence this evening.  I would like to hear the Minister's opinions, if possible, on the aspects of horse racing that do not fall under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

The Fianna F&aacute;il Party will be supporting the regulations and we believe it is important to provide this financial support and stimulus to the horse racing and greyhound sectors.  Both have reaped the dividends in the past years.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, our horse racing and horse breeding industry here is among the best in the world.  What has been done since the late 1960s in terms of how the industry has been transformed is a story that goes beyond what anyone could have expected.  Funding is central to continuing development.  I think that is important and we will certainly support what is being done.  As the Minister indicated, the recent report conducted by Deloitte on behalf of Horse Racing Ireland outlines how the sector and the industry benefit the economy as a whole.  What is important is that the benefits are spread throughout the regions.  Those benefits are an important to rural areas.  It is often forgotten that the majority of breeders run small operations.<\/p> <p>  Likewise, funding for the greyhound industry is very important.  The Minister referred to the greyhound industry Bill.  It is important that this Bill is expedited.  Will he provide an update on the timeline relating to it?<\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly touched on the issue of the betting tax.  I would be interested in further feedback on the assessment from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Finance on the impact the extension of the tax to online betting has had.  Is all online betting being taxed?  This is primarily a matter for the Department of Finance.  However, I would like to hear the Minister's views on his engagement with that Department as to how matters might proceed.<\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly also referred to how labour is treated in the horse racing sector in particular.  It is important that work done in the sector should be regarded as agricultural activity.  It is also important that there be flexibility in work practices in order to ensure that the type work done in training yards is included in such activity.  I know that is an issue and I would like to hear the Minister's comments on it.<\/p> <p>  There has been a tradition of harness racing in Ireland but it has not been as popular here in recent years as has been the case in countries such as France, where it is very significant part of the horse racing industry.  This matter was discussed by the committee in 2015 and, following on from that, Indecon was commissioned to conduct a report to establish the potential for expanding and supporting harness racing in Ireland.  Indecon made certain recommendations in its report.  Will the Minister expand on how those recommendations have been progressed?  I am of the view that work in this regard has been much too slow.  It is important that the Indecon recommendations be considered.<\/p> <p>  Representatives from the Irish Harness Racing Association have met most members to discuss the Indecon recommendations.  One of these is to the effect that seed funding be provided to the Irish Harness Racing Association in order to enable it to act on the recommendations and develop the sector.  In order to facilitate the latter, the report suggests that the association establish a race track.  There are important timelines involved in the context of enabling the sector to grow.  Will the Minister outline where he wishes to bring harness racing and provide a commitment to the effect that the recommendations will be acted upon and that seed funding will be made available in order to facilitate development?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112100002#P00400","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1511281800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation  I would like to declare a personal interest.  I am a director of a privately-owned greyhound stadium.<\/p> <p>  These two industries are very important to the Irish economy.  We had the unprecedented achievement in the past couple of week of three Irish-trained horses finishing first, second and third in the Melbourne Cup, which is known as \"the race that stops a nation\".  That Ireland could bring three horses to Australia and that they would fill the first three places is a major achievement and a significant advertisement for our industry.<\/p> <p>  Those involved in greyhound racing and horse racing were disappointed that no increase in funding was announced in the budget.  In light of the increased revenue from taxation of both industries, they are of the view that there is a valid argument for an increase in funding.  We have met representatives from both industries and they put forward very valid arguments in respect of where the extra money could be invested for the benefit of the horse racing and greyhound industries.  Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon have very ambitious plans to advance their industries.<\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly outlined the potential on the taxation side and questioned whether we are capturing all of the revenue from the taxes that apply.  I wish to make a case for those in one sector of the industry that are under extreme pressure, namely, track bookmakers.  These individuals are definitely voting with their feet because the number of them involved in the sector is growing progressively smaller.<\/p><p>Unless we do something on the taxation side to give them an incentive, track bookmakers will become an extinct species.  Track bookmakers are vitally important to the social aspect and the whole concept of Irish racing.  I refer to the atmosphere in the ring.  The track bookmakers are a huge part of that environment.  Bookmakers make the point to me that the track bookmakers are using exchanges to try and boost their turnover.  Their view is that the level of tax that is being charged to the large corporations should not apply to track bookmakers, and if there was exemption for those under a certain turnover and the level of tax on betting exchanges was reduced, that would be a very significant incentive for track bookmakers and would allow them to try to stay in business.  There has been significant growth in the yield from taxation but the amount of money that is being taken off track bookmakers in taxation is small.  Unless we do something concrete for them, I fear for their survival.  As I stated, they are a significant part of the sector and it would be a sad day if they disappeared off the scene.  A monopoly would not be in anyone's interest.<\/p><p> The Minister mentioned the draft general scheme of the greyhound industry Bill.  That has gone through the committee here.  The proposed Bill is urgently needed.  The sooner it can become legislation the better.  I suppose there has been much adverse publicity for the sector.  The sector needs the mechanics of this Bill in order to deal with the issues it currently faces.  Issues are dragging on for far too long and they are not being dealt with promptly enough.  Talking to members of the sector, their hands are tied as regards advancing those issues quickly.  The proposed Bill could tighten up a lot of the legislation.  When an offence is committed, we need to intervene and bring it to a conclusion a lot more quickly and not have it dragging on for six or 12 months, as is the case in some of the occurrences in the recent past.<\/p><p> Point-to-points were mentioned.  I attended my local point-to-point on Sunday last.  It was held in Thurles and there was a fair crowd.  It brought home to me the value of it to the local economy that the small man can start off there with his horse at minimal expense and get it into a shop window.  If one is lucky enough to have a horse that is good enough to win, even at a local point-to-point like that, the big buyers are there and the opportunity is there to get a worthwhile return on a shoestring budget.  I had occasion to see a local horse winning on Sunday and there was a knock-on benefit in the form of a queue of people who were trying to purchase a horse that looked to be promising.  Everyone who has a horse lives for that dream, namely, that he or she will have one that can go out and win and give a significant return.  Thankfully, Ireland's reputation as the producer of top-class horses is greatly adding to the economical benefit of producing those young horses.<\/p><p> Senator Paul Daly made a couple of points about the definition of agriculture and the way employment law and rates are being interpreted by different Departments.  On the employment side, there has to be recognition that if we change the categorisation, it will make it impractical for stables to operate.  Unfortunately, long days are the norm.  If one has a horse going to a sales or a race meeting, the person who is handling that horse will have an extremely long day.  In agriculture, we are used to peaks and troughs.  At harvesting time, long days are accepted.  A re-classification of the horse-breeding sector to non-agricultural is not practical and will not work in the future.  That issue must be addressed.  On the rates side, it is agriculture and it should be rated as such.<\/p><p> As Deputy McConalogue stated, we as a party are glad to support the motion.  We see the benefits of this fund for the two sectors.  There are very ambitious plans by both Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon and the fund has a huge part to play in that.  We have two sectors that we can be justifiably proud of and anything we can do here for the development of these sectors must be welcomed.<\/p><p> On the harness racing mentioned by Deputy McConalogue, everyone here has been lobbied.  It is in an infant stage.  They have had trial racing at Dundalk track and it has gone well for them.  They have had connections with the French sector where harness racing is extremely big.  They see very significant potential in this sport.  They want to try and develop a race track for themselves.  What they have proposed to us does not involve a huge amount of money.  It is dealing with a different type of horse.  There is very significant potential for us to develop this sector.  As regards the seed capital they are looking for, the Department should try to look favourably on this, give them a leg-up on the ladder and see how far they can go.  Up to now, they have achieved everything they stated they would do, including getting French sponsorship.  They are at a crossroads.  Everything has been done on a voluntary basis up to now.  They need to put a structure in place if they are to develop this sector further.  It would be regrettable if we were not in position to give harness racing the chance to fulfil the potential those involved in the sector strongly believe exists.  It will be a specialised sport but it can have a niche market.  It is one we should try to develop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112100002#P00500","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511281800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Paul Daly and Deputies McConalogue and Cahill for their observations and questions.<\/p> <p>  I might deal with the last point on harness racing first.  It is true to say that the Indecon report, which now charts the blueprint and the roadmap for the sector, was probably conceived in these committee rooms in the context of the Horse Racing Ireland legislation.  As the committee will be aware, that report was commissioned and the Department published it in October.  Historically, it is also true to say, as Deputy Cahill alluded to, that this is a sector which, in the not-too-distant past, almost had predominance as the equine sector that attracted the greatest levels of public support.  It has, however, for one reason or another, fallen significantly in the intervening period.  It has significant potential to re-establish itself.  Recently, I met informally representatives of the sector post the publication of Indecon.  As a Department, we see a public gain to be had from working with the sector.  There are issues the public at large wants to see addressed and from my engagement with the Irish Harness Racing Association, it is an appropriate vehicle and is interested in working with the Department to address some of the issues in the areas of public concern, apart altogether from the economic potential of the sector.<\/p> <p>  Indecon made five key recommendations.  One was to recognise the Irish Harness Racing Association as the appropriate governing body.  It also stated that the corporate governance of the sector needed to improve.  It talked about developing a five-year plan in terms of where the sector should go.  I cannot recall all five recommendations.  One was that the Department should continue to fund the pilot project on horse welfare and education with which it has been involved in that area.  It also spoke about a financial plan for the sector.  That is the blueprint.  The sector now needs to reflect, and probably not to respond in haste but to lay a solid foundation.  If it is a solid foundation, this Department will work with the sector in terms of achieving its potential.<\/p><p>I appreciate the point about Dundalk.  I have been working with French harness racing interests which have shown the potential that is there.  It is a sector with a wide geographical spread.  In my own county, and in west Cork especially, there is a particularly strong interest in it, and it is a long established tradition.  We want to work with the sector.  At a recent meeting, I told them that our budgets for 2018 are already published.  It will take the Irish Harness Racing Association time to digest and construct the appropriate responses outlined in the Indecon report.  When it does that, it will not find the Department wanting in terms of working with it.  There are issues around unstructured harness racing on public roadways which is the subject of adverse comment in the media and there are significant animal welfare concerns around it. This is an area where we would like the Irish Harness Racing Association and the Department to work together and bring about a public gain.  We also hope that the two working together would enable the Irish Harness Racing Association would enable it to achieve the sector's potential.  It has an international dimension and is something that can benefit the economy but we have the Indecon report and now our challenge is to build on it.  Having met representatives of the sector, I know they recognise that too.  <\/p><p> A number of other points lend themselves to quick responses.  I hope to take the greyhound Bill to Cabinet before Christmas and publish it afterwards.  <\/p><p> Senator Paul Daly spoke of the betting tax and referred to international comparisons with the funding available, I think he mentioned France.  I am conscious that while &euro;80 million is a lot of money, it is not in comparison with the support available in our competitor countries, a term I use advisedly because it is a very mobile industry which, if the policy framework was not right here could relocate in a substantial way.  The funding available in other countries far exceeds the amount we are in a position to put into the sector, not only in France but elsewhere.  We must keep an open mind on these matters.  Primarily the betting tax is an issue for the Department of Finance but we need to ensure that we make continual progress in funding the sector.  This year, the fund remains the same as last year but in the exceptionally difficult three preceding years, there was a &euro;6 million increase year on year for three years and then this year, in a very difficult year, we held the fund at &euro;80 million.  I take the Senator's point that when one stands still, it is like going backwards and certainly, I would like to revisit the fund next year, but in the context of a very difficult budget with many competing interests, it was not an insignificant achievement given what occurred in the three proceeding years.<\/p><p> I am very conscious of the point to which the Senator alluded, although he was not specific, regarding the WRC issue.  I do not wish to trespass on the area while it is before the WRC but it is one on which we keep a very anxious eye.  We are very conscious of the implications it could have on the industry and especially for smaller players.

I do not think that anyone wants a situation where the only option available is the tote.  It is an issue that Horse Racing Ireland has been considering and there has been engagement with bookmakers on the matter and I hope a resolution is imminent.  I encourage both Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon to be conscious that these people bring colour to race meetings generally and that the race meeting environment would be much poorer without them.  I understand that there is significant competition for pitches especially in horse racing, but we must ensure that they can survive and whatever steps that need to be taken by both bodies should be considered in a fashion that ensures this.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill also raised point to point racing.  It is something I was very conscious of on my appointment.  We have a huge international reputation - Deputy Cahill referred to the Melbourne Cup which was a staggeringly good shop window for us, for Irish trained horses to take the first three places is unprecedented - but that is built on a foundation often laid in local communities, with small owners and breeding establishments.  Point-to-point races are the critical shop window for them and there is no point in saying otherwise.  The organisers of point to points were under tremendous pressure in recent years to continue to provide that service.  Happily, last year we succeeded in significantly addressing the financial concerns of the organisers and addressed the available prize money for races.  I am confident that will continue to be built upon.  That is the critical foundation for the industry which we showcase internationally and is something I am exceptionally proud of.  Significantly increasing prize money and grant aid to the committees organising point-to-points, I believe it was from &euro;4,000 to &euro;6,000 last year, was important and was recognition of the critical service that they provide.  <\/p> <p>  I think I have dealt with everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112100002#R00300","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1511281800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>We can come back if there is anything else.

My understanding is that a number of Deputies present had said they could not support the funding that was proposed in the motion unless a serious commitment was given to address the Irish Harness Racing Association.  This report was commissioned on the back of that.  The Department has had this report since May and it took five or six months for the report to be published.  My concern is that in this industry, people acting in good faith have built relationships internationally and are paying their own way to travel to international events and conferences to build an industry in Ireland.  They have done tremendous work.  The Indecon report clearly endorses that and believes in the sector's potential.  However, there are things that frustrate me.  The Department has allocated &euro;500,000 to Horse Racing Ireland which was also the subject of an Indecon report, published in May this year.  Why did this Indecon report into the potential of harness racing, whose publication is way over due, have to wait for six months?  The Minister says that money is allocated for 2018 but he is coming before the committee with a motion for money to be allocated to other sectors.  That is fair enough but the harness racers are looking for seed funding.  The Minister refers to the corporate challenges they face, but they are stepping up to them.  Like others here, I have met with them and am immensely impressed by them.<\/p><p>They have provided initial training to board members and further training is under way.  The size of the board has been expanded.  There are five subcommittees.  A core five-year strategy is being prepared and will be ready in mid-December.  The board will outline its plans to the committee in January.  The board needs seed funding to cover implementation.  The Minister has said he wants to address some of the issues in INDECON.  INDECON has clearly recommended that seed funding should be allocated to the IHRA to enable it to move on and address matters.  It is understandable that the Government needs reassurances about a five-year plan, the corporate structure and oversight in the industry, the sector, the animals and so on.<\/p><p> Two years ago this committee took a stand about the following.  Personally speaking, having considered this situation, I believe it is deeply unfair that the publication of the report was delayed by six months and post the budget allocation for 2018.  The association has made huge sacrifices.  It has reached a critical moment in terms of its future.  As one can see from the report the association does not have a huge amount of financial resources but anyone can see that it has a huge amount of ability and commitment.  It needs the Government to step in and act as its partner.  A significant investment will come from France over a number of years, which demonstrates that the sector has immense potential and international friends.  People have asked why they should invest in the area forever if its own Government or State will not do so.<\/p><p> I appreciate the comments the Minister has made today.  Clearly, he supports the IHRA and has met them recently so I have no gripe with him.  I know from what he has said that he is supportive and open to the association.  Everything he has said has been encouraging.  He acknowledged at the outset that the committee took a stand on this issue a number of years ago.  Through no fault of the association the report was delayed by five or six months.  If the report had been released on time and the association had received seed funding it would now be in a much stronger position.  The association does not just need seed funding but capital funding.  If it can secure a particular racing track soon it will prove very beneficial.  It is a huge opportunity that must not be missed.  We have a group of people here who have made considerable personal and financial sacrifices.  They have real enthusiasm for the sector.  They have been pretty much endorsed and vindicated by an independent report.  However, they need some financial assistance to implement some of the structures, improve organisational structures and appoint key staff.  As the Minister will know, the association does not have any staff.  I urge him to consider providing a portion of what he has recommended today: it is a relatively small amount of money.<\/p><p> In terms of the Minister asking the committee to support the motion for funding to be provided for the two sectors, I am saying there is money available.  In terms of the request for seed funding, I ask that the Department engages with the IHRA to ensure that it has the assurances that it needs.  This is a critical moment for the association.  It is unfair of the Minister and his Department to say there is no funding for 2018 because publication of the report was delayed by his Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112100002#R00500","speaker":"1400","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511281800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017112100002#S00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1511281800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I can clarify that aspect in a minute.

There is potential for an extra &euro;20 million per year to be generated, which is not to be sniffed at, and the amount will only increase.<\/p> <p>  Horse racing is hugely important to the economy.  I was lucky enough to watch a marvellous film that I am sure will be of interest to this committee.  The film \"Against the Odds - Racing with Gordon Lord Byron\" was made by a young man, Nicholas Ryan-Purcell from Cloughjordan, County Tipperary.  The film tells a fantastic story about the owners of the horse, the Cahalan family, who literally started off racing the horse at point-to-point races.  Sadly, the horse broke its pelvis.  The horse was due to be put down but the family decided to work on him with his trainer, Tom Hogan.  Thankfully, the horse has gone from strength to strength and now is internationally successful.  I recommend everybody should watch the film as it gives an insight into how important the sector is to rural communities.  It is amazing to realise how many people work in the sector.  The film also showcases the joy of winning and the passion that goes into preparing horses for racing.  The sector is incredibly important and we need to continue investing in the sector.  I support the Minister in anything he wants to do to support the sector as the sector is so crucial to rural Ireland.  I hope the Chairman will forgive me for mentioning the film but anyone who watches it will gain a great insight into the sector.<\/p> <p>  I shall return to discussing hypothecation.

There is tremendous effort on their part to try to do that and I wholly support anything that could be done to put a seed fund in place for them.  It would be more than disappointing if Horse Racing Ireland and the other sectors were to get such a huge amount of funding while the IHRA is left out again.  That would be just unacceptable.  I understand that it is looking for an initial sum of &euro;600,000 or &euro;700,000 as seed capital to get up and running and going.  It would reflect society's sense of responsibility to people who are doing the right thing to allow them get themselves going and to ensure they are regulated properly.<\/p><p> We have had Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon in here before this committee.  We have had rows with them, generally over how things are run and operated.  I know that the Minister and others have acknowledged the difficulties, to put it mildly, that exist in these organisations.  Situations like the one we saw recently involving the doping of dogs keep coming up all of the time.  There is a sense of despair.  I spoke to a number of people in that industry the other day and they were still of the view that little is changing.  It is to be hoped the Bill will go some considerable way towards regulating and putting some kind of shape on matters.  Many people are very fearful, however, and I look for the Minister's reassurance that the greyhound Bill will bring a very firm hand to this when it goes through.

Can a commitment be made to give it that money?  As the Minister has mentioned himself, it is clear, going through everything that we have seen here, that the IHRA has made a fair effort and even addressed many of the governance issues flagged in the Indecon report.  There is a premises in Portmarnock, as the Minister is probably aware, that is currently in receivership and will be sold shortly, and this is an opportunity for the IHRA to move forward.  Is there a commitment to solve this?<\/p> <p>  With regard to horse racing in Ireland, all of us who come from rural Ireland are aware of the benefits of having racing tracks at Galway or wherever else.  We can all see what it does for communities when people buy young horses and then have luck with them on the road and the same is true of greyhound racing.  I support this but I ask the Minister to confirm that money will be given to the harness racing body to get it up and running because it is clear from the figures we have seen that this would end up as a money-spinner.  There has been a lot of betting in other countries, in France for example, on races that have taken place here.  As the Minister said, this sport was big years ago and now seems to be making a comeback.  There is an opportunity here but when it comes to getting funding harness racing seems to be seen as the bad relation.

The point has been made that the Department delayed or had some mischievous intent to delay the publication of the report.  This was not the case.  We commissioned the report in good faith and we recognise the potential of the IHRA to become the kind of body with which we can engage in a structured way and into which we confidently invest taxpayers' money.  The clear inference here, however, is that the IHRA is not currently that kind of body.  The Indecon report states that its identification of a seed funding requirement of &euro;770,000 is conditional on the IHRA delivering on a number of matters, including a five-year strategic plan, which has not been received, and a costed programme identifying the specific target areas for expenditure and what the return would be on that investment.  What the Department is saying here is that we have a fund and a document on which we can make progress.  In all honesty, however, I cannot at this point commit taxpayers' money to an organisation that Indecon has clearly indicated is not one we could work with, at least not in its current manifestation.  The IHRA people I met recognised, in fairness to them, that they still have a journey ahead.  If the association can move and deliver on all of these conditions very quickly, we will have to assess at that point if is fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>  What we are open to doing, however, is engaging with them.  We, too, see public gain in the issues raised by the members, particularly when it comes to welfare, and as a signal of good faith we are in fact committing to continuing and to expanding the funding we already make available in the areas of harness racing, horse welfare, and the involvement of the Traveller community.  We are signalling good faith but we are also acknowledging, and it would be remiss of us to do otherwise, the fact that Indecon has said that the Irish Harness Racing Association is not fit for purpose in its current form.  The IHRA has itself recognised that and recognised that it has a journey before it when it comes to corporate governance, drawing up a five-year plan, and so on.  There is an open door to this in the Department.  I have met representatives of the IHRA already and we have officials ready to engage with them to reach the point where we can have confidence in committing public funds.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mac Lochlainn referred to the Horse Sport Ireland, HSI, to the Indecon report, and to the additional funding of less than &euro;500,000 that HSI received this year.  We need to be aware, however, that HSI is a State body that has been in existence for more than ten years.  Specific deliverables are required to draw down that funding and we have clearly stated that that additional funding is contingent on the implementation of the reform outlined in the Indecon report for HSI.  We are using the same yardstick here.  I acknowledge the potential of the harness racing sector and we have the basis on which to proceed.  The enthusiasm of the people I met is infectious.  They are very committed and I appreciate that they have been putting their own resources into this.  We must equally acknowledge, however, that if we are to commit substantial public funds to the initial request for &euro;770,000, we have to be sure that we have a structure in which we can have confidence.

The Indecon report provides for the potential of a long-term strategic relationship between the Department and Irish Harness Racing Association.  It is my personal belief that if the report had been published the day after we received it, any serious five-year strategic plan for the sector would have taken approximately that length of time to put together the appropriate documentation that we require to convince us that this is an organisation with which we can have a long-term strategic relationship.  It cannot be written in a week or three weeks and it slightly worries me that there is now a headlong rush to say that we can do it in a condensed and short period of time without having the appropriate reflection or the level of professional input into compiling a five-year strategic plan for the industry, which is a serious document and not something that can be magically made in weeks.

One will not compile a five-year strategic plan in the period of time since that publication.  It would be a challenge to do it in the number of months that have passed since the Department got the report.  That is the type of document we are examining.  It is a serious piece of work.  If it is done properly it will lay a very solid foundation on which to build and to get to a point where we can replicate the potential that this industry is achieving in other jurisdictions, particularly in France.  However, it is necessary to make haste slowly and to do it right.  I have every confidence, given the enthusiasm of the people I have met and their business acumen, that they know a five-year strategic plan is not something that can be magicked up in a short space of time.

The delegation is jointly led by me and Councillor Bobby O'Connell.  I am a member of Longford County Council and Vice-President of the Association of Irish Local Government.  Councillor Bobby O&rsquo;Connell is the General Secretary of the Local Authority Members Association and a member of Kerry County Council.  Both of the associations thank the committee Chairman and members for giving us an opportunity to discuss the Bill with them and the implications that the Bill will have for elected members at local authority level. <\/p> <p>  First, we wish to clarify with the committee that neither association held meetings with officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the Bill, as has been referenced previously by the Department of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Bill was referenced at meetings, in general terms, that the AILG had with officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The Bill was mentioned in the context of the AILG's elected members' training programme and the possibility of providing further training in the area of ethics and governance for elected members.<\/p><p>However, at no stage was the Bill or its contents and possible implications discussed in detail by officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with either representative body.  Indeed, we would not expect it to be as the Department did not propose the Bill.  Therefore, we welcome the opportunity to highlight our concerns about the Bill.  We wish to confirm that we are available to meet the officials from the government reform unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss our concerns if they so wish. <\/p><p> It is important to state that while both associations have some concerns with certain aspects of the draft Bill, and that while we welcome any measures to strengthen the standards that the public rightfully expect from people in public office, we reiterate that the vast majority of the 949 local councillors across the country are hardworking men and women whose only interest is to serve the communities that have elected them.  We welcome a robust and transparent system for the declaration of assets and business interests for public representatives.  However, we feel that some of the measures in the Bill may place additional extensive and onerous obligations and responsibilities on our members.  <\/p><p> We would like to make some specific points about some provisions in the Bill and their possible implications for our members.  At this stage I would like to apologise on behalf of the president of the AILG, Mr. Damien Geoghegan.  Unfortunately, he was unable to attend today.  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Bobby O'Connell, Chairman of the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112100002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Luie McEntire","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511280000,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I wish to refer to section 5 of the Bill on categories of public official.  We are concerned about local authority members being classified as a category A public official.<\/p> <p>  We note that there is a proposal in section 5 for local authority members to be classified as category A public officials along with Oireachtas Members, special advisers, chairpersons and CEOs of public bodies, and those on remuneration at deputy secretary level and above in the public sector.<\/p> <p>  Category A public officials will also have the highest level of obligations under the Bill.  Category B public officials are classified as those on remuneration between principal officer level and deputy secretary in the public sector, and will also include a member of the board of a public body, excluding the chairperson.  Category C public officials will be classified as being all other public officials.  We would question the requirement to class our members as category A public officials and place them in the same category and level as Oireachtas Members and CEOs of public bodies given the powers, responsibilities and resources available that our members have at local level.  We contend that local authority members should be equated with members of a board of a public body.  Therefore, we suggest that local authority members should be classed as category B public officials at most. <\/p> <p>  An additional implication for being classified as category A public officials is the obligation to submit all declarations to the Commissioner of their interests during the relevant declaration period.  If our members were re-classified as category B public officials, which we are now, the requirement would be to submit all declarations to the relevant public body as is the current requirement under the various Ethics and Local Government Act. <\/p> <p>  Section 8 refers to private declarable interests.  We have concerns about private declarations and income from an employment.  Both the AILG and LAMA have grave concerns about some of the proposals about the private declarations in section 8 of the draft Bill on declarable interests.  For instance, while we accept and understand the requirement to make a public declaration on a member's employment, profession, business and directorship status, we absolutely fail to understand the reasoning one needs to make a private declaration about the amount of his or her remuneration, particularly a PAYE employment.<\/p><p>We would argue that if an elected member has a conflict of interest on a local authority as a result of his or her employment, the amount of their remuneration is irrelevant as the conflict of interest already exists by virtue of their employment and they should recuse themselves from the matter in their role as an elected member.  We would also contend that the requirement to declare a member&rsquo;s private income from an employment, trade or profession would be a data protection issue.<\/p><p> Section 8 concerns private declarations and declarations of assets.  Again, under section 8 of the draft Bill, both associations have grave concerns in relation to the proposed requirement for category A officials to make a private declaration of liabilities and assets over &euro;50,000, excluding pensions or a charge on the family home.  We feel that this is an excessive requirement and indeed a potential invasion of privacy for our members, particularly on financial assets over &euro;50,000 that they will now be requested to declare.  For example, we fail to see the reasoning whereby an elected member who is left financial assets of over &euro;50,000 in a family will, due to a bereavement, has to declare it even in a private capacity and why such an example like this would affect their role as an elected member.<\/p><p> Section 8 also relates to private declarable interests, private declarations and the declaration of gifts not connected to official function.  Both associations question the requirement for category A officials to make a private declaration on receipt of gifts and travel of between &euro;200 and &euro;600, received from a person not related, when it is not connected to a function in our member's capacity as an elected member.  Again, our members feel these instances may be of a personal nature and if it is unconnected to their capacity and function as an elected member, there should be no requirement for a declaration.  We would contend that declarations in general should only be required where the gift or travel is received where it is connected to a function and we welcome the provision in the draft Bill under section 11 of the requirement and obligation for public officials to refuse such gifts in the first instance and notify the commissioner of same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bobby O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511280000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Section 16 deals with the obligation to furnish a tax clearance certificate.  Under the proposed provisions contained within section 16 of the draft Bill, we would request that the period for production of a tax clearance certificate should be increased to 12 months, from the current six-month requirement, following enactment of the Bill.  We would also request that where members cannot produce a tax clearance certificate but have confirmation from the Revenue Commissioners that they are in the process and engaging with Revenue to bring their tax affairs up to date, this confirmation will suffice until such time as the Revenue Commissioners issue a tax clearance certificate to the member.  We would also contend that this proposed provision should be extended on an annual basis for the requirement to furnish an annual tax clearance certificate by the 30 April of each year.  We note the provisions contained in section 18 and section 19 in relation to evidence of subsequent compliance and an application statement for a tax clearance certificate, but we feel that providing for the above in relation to the production of a tax clearance certificate would be appropriate.<\/p> <p>  On section 33, both the AILG and LAMA have serious concerns in relation to the powers of the new commissioner, proposed under section 33 of the draft Bill, to accept written complaints from any person.  The original general scheme of the Bill set out that any complainant has up to 12 months from the date on which evidence sufficient to justify the complaint comes to such person&rsquo;s knowledge, and not later than five years from the date on which the alleged contravention was committed, to make a complaint against a public official.  Upon receipt of a complaint, the commissioner may dismiss the complaint, deal with it by issuing advice, refer it to the relevant public body, or cause a preliminary inquiry of the complaint to be carried out.  However, the Bill only specifies that a complaint must be based on evidence sufficient to justify the making of the complaint.  Both representative bodies would contend that the yardstick for measuring sufficient evidence needs to be set at the higher end to combat malicious, vexatious or repetitious complaints.<\/p><p>For all public representatives, the threat of a malicious complaint with no basis can be detrimental to an elected member&rsquo;s political career and we feel that further safeguards should be put into the Bill to ensure that our members are protected from any malicious and vexatious complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112100002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511280000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I will start with concerns on excessive administrative requirements for local elected members.

This provision is a major turn-off for people involved in private business because the amount one pays one's employees is commercially sensitive information.

I was very happy when I was in the organisation.  I thank the Chairman for being helpful as always.<\/p> <p>  Much of the discussion on the Bill in this committee has taken place in private session.  Senators were not privy to the discussions on the Bill in the select committee, although I read the transcripts of the relevant meetings.  There is publicly declarable and privately declarable information.  The issue is that privately declarable information could be subject to data protection and could be leaked or whatever.  All of this information should be declarable.  It is declarable to the Revenue Commissioners and privately.  If the Revenue wishes to investigate anybody, it has, as one of my former lecturers on tax once stated, more powers than garda&iacute; involved in a murder hunt have.  That has always been the case.<\/p> <p>  I do not get the reason the Standards in Public Office Commission or the body that succeeds it needs to know whether an individual in the public sector, specifically a category A official, has a cash balance of more than &euro;50,000 or any asset other than the family home worth more than &euro;50,000.  As Councillor O'Reilly stated, we are trying to convince people to enter and stay in local politics.  This proposal will create an administrative burden.  Most councillors do not have secretaries.  They are one-person operations and answer all their emails and take all their telephone calls.  Now they are to be asked to report every three or four months on whether there has been a material change to their circumstances.  The definition of \"material change\" in this context is a major issue as it will have a significantly different meaning for different people.  An additional &euro;1 million in income may not be a material change for some leading business people, whereas a much lower sum would be a material change for most of us.  The term \"material change\" is vague.<\/p> <p>  I take Mr. Moylan's point about the declaration of income and category A versus category B requirements.  Although income will be privately rather than publicly declared, if it is all being recorded and declared to the Revenue, I do not understand the reason it must be declared to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The same applies to details regarding assets of a value of &euro;50,000 or more.  The requirements regarding gifts and travel create another administrative burden and the limits appear to be set at a low level.<\/p> <p>  Once the system for tax clearance certificates is up and running, it probably will be fine.  However, I agree that a lead-in period is required to allow leeway to people who may not be familiar with the process.  Many of the 949 local councillors will have no issue with the proposed requirement, either because their entire income comes from the public purse and they do not have other sources of income or because they are privately employed and may have obtained a tax clearance certificate for other reasons, such as doing work for a local authority or public body.  The issue here is the additional administrative burden being placed on local councillors.  They must already make a donation statement in January and an ethical declaration in February and they soon will be required to make quarterly reports on all travel connected with various bodies.  I am not sure how many people will have to do this but it is another burden.  Councillors must also submit various conference reports and other information.  These requirements create another burden.  What will happen if something goes slightly wrong or a councillor forgets something?  Are councillors supposed to count the money in their wallet or pockets because everything above a value of &euro;50,000 must be declared?  Are they supposed to count and declare every cent in every bank account they may have and get land or fields valued every quarter?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses did not refer to head 10, which proposes to prohibit local representatives whose outside role primarily involves the sale or development of land from dealing with that land during their term of office and for two years afterwards where their local authority has changed the development plan or zoning and they have been involved with the decision.<\/p><p>This has major implications for auctioneers, solicitors, quantity surveyors, architects, engineers and everyone else involved in the construction sector, let alone those who might be involved in farming or have done something with their land.

I happened to be a representative in the geographically smallest local authority in the country.  It was 8 miles long and 5 miles wide.  In large counties, however, a councillor who is an architect or quantity surveyor could be rezoning land a long way from where he or she lives only to be asked in a year's time to submit a tender.  The councillor would not have known of any future involvement.  People need to be aware of this.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we acknowledge that this Bill is being introduced on foot of many issues, but people have not copped how administratively burdensome it will be for certain people in some types of industry through no fault of their own.

Most councillors are one-person operations.  If they do not do it, it does not get done.  There is a lot of work involved.<\/p><p> The process should be streamlined to make it easier.  I do not understand why people have to declare assets themselves.  If a councillor has a large loan, someone might say that he or she has debts of &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million and could be susceptible, although that is not guaranteed.

It is the private declarations that we fail to understand.  If I work for a company that has come into conflict with the local authority, I should declare my interest as an employee of that company regardless of whether I am working for the minimum wage or on &euro;100,000 a year.  To us, the conflict stems from one's employment.

Deputy Dara Calleary asked if it would dissuade people from running for local office.  The Senator was a councillor for a long time and represented the people very well.  Not alone would this measure dissuade people from running in the local elections but, as Mr. Moylan pointed out, there must also be a balance in the council chamber.  The Senator is aware - a number of Senators present were councillors - that in a place of employment people must be employed who understand what is going, there must be a gender balance and so on.  Local government in Ireland is starting to become a place for those who are self-employed or retired, which is not fair.<\/p> <p>  Every year there is more and more red tape and bureaucracy for councillors.  Senator Gerry Horkan has spoken about the increased burden imposed by administration.  We would have no issue with the extra administration if we were given a few pounds to cover it, but once again councillors are being targeted as full-time, paid employees of county councils.  They are not; they are office holders.  They are, however, designated in the Bill as being in category A which includes Oireachtas Members and other full-time representatives.  They are not full-time but part-time and serve their communities as best they can.  Committee members are correct that councillors all have another place of employment to ensure they can support their families financially.  Further remuneration was announced last week, but it equates to &euro;520 per year or &euro;10 per week.  While we are very excited about whatever remuneration we receive as local councillors, once again we are bearing the brunt of further legislation that will be especially prohibitive for those who want to run for local office.  We ask that councillors remain in category B because including them in category A is actually bringing them to a stage where they will be full-time, paid employees.  If the legislators want to put us in category A, let them pay us as individuals included in that category.

No declaration is required if it is from a relative and there is no limit in receiving a gift as long as it is not connected to a function.  That is right because they are private and personal.<\/p><p>We believe that if gifts are received from a third party, there will be a requirement for category A public officials to make private declarations once it goes over a certain limit, even though the gifts are not connected with the function.  We would distinguish between accepting a gift that is connected with a function and accepting one that is not connected with a function.  We welcome the provision under section 11 of the Bill where if a person tries to give a gift that is connected with his or her function to an elected member or category A public representative or any official, the obligation is on the public official to refuse the gift.  There is an additional obligation to notify the SIPO commissioner.  We welcome this provision.  If, however, it is not connected to their functions and with the limits set at over &euro;600, our members at local authority level would feel that some of these gifts could be of a personal nature, even from a person who is not connected to the representative.  Members might ask why a private declaration would have to be made for that.  In the context of the proof needed on whether the gift was or was not connected to a function, it comes down to somebody making a complaint and the ensuing investigation process.  A public official may be able to genuinely state that it was not connected with a function but if it is, then we would have issues with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Moylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511280000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>There would be specific guidelines on that.

Concerns were raised about the content of the Bill when the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, attended the committee.  There was some ambiguity surrounding what is currently required from local representatives and what is outlined in the Bill.  It seemed there was no understanding that there would be an increase in capacity in some areas.<\/p> <p>  I have no specific question but I wish to make two or three points on the Bill about areas on which I am concerned.  I would welcome comments from the councillors.  I worked as an employee for an accountancy practice and I was a councillor.  That would come under the scope of section 8.  As a councillor and an employee in an office environment, one's salary would become declarable.  As a member of Chartered Accountants Ireland I know that I have to make a self declaration every year but it is not based on figures that would disclose commercially sensitive information from competitor to competitor.  In essence, if I was going to audit a client the travel expenses for the two or three weeks on that job would become declarable under the Act.  That would present a difficulty to any employer or individual doing audits or who is seconded for work.  That is ironic when one considers the content of the Bill.  It would provide a significant problem.<\/p> <p>  If someone in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is doing a farm inspection does he or she have to disclose travel expenses?  Where does the buck stop in that regard?  I am most concerned about that measure.  There is an onus on public representatives in terms of transparency when dealing with sensitive issues such as land zoning but I cannot see the logic in somebody holding down an ordinary job in the private sector being required to disclose the salary and the associated expenses.  If a rep is going around selling tyres who is getting genuine travel expenses that are approved by the Revenue in terms of that private sector company's return it is beyond me why they would become declarable.  The committee needs to bring those concerns to the Minister.<\/p><p>It makes it very difficult for politics to attract the best people.  In terms of attracting good people, when I became a councillor eight or ten years ago it might have been very difficult for me to run for election while working in the private sector given that all the information relating to the firm I work for would be in the public domain.  That would probably not be allowable from my perspective.  The issue is very serious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112100002#N00700","speaker":"1369","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511280000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome the councillors.  This is a very important Bill which will have significant consequences for councillors not just for the foreseeable future but in the long term.  I totally agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputies Calleary and Peter Burke and the Senators who have spoken.  The two organisations will have to take a close look at the Bill.  Some expertise will be required in order to assist them and give advice.  They can draft amendments and give them to the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  As Deputy Burke outlined in his case, this has consequences for every person that is employed who wants to be a public representative as well.<\/p> <p>  If the Bill was introduced in its present form it would take a considerable amount of time to train the 900 or so councillors throughout the country.  How do the witnesses envisage that would be done?  Would it be entirely up to the Department to do it or would it be the role of the local authorities?  As has been said, any member of the public could make a complaint and ignorance of the legislation on the part of a public representative will not be a defence.<\/p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh said she got a shock when she went to Mayo County Council and saw the number of auctioneers in it.  That could well be the case, but as she can imagine, given a councillor's workload one would probably need to have another job and auctioneering was probably a neat fit.  However, that is not the case at the moment because one must be qualified to be an auctioneer and there are educational attainments one must have.  It is a completely different scenario now.<\/p> <p>  In the case of a material contravention or a rezoning under the Bill a meeting might not be able to take place at all because of the presence of a solicitor, auctioneer or landowner from a particular area and if they all declared an interest in it, that they might have an interest in the future or that it might affect them in the future, as the Bill specifies, there might not be any councillors present to pass a material change to a plan.

All these restrictions being put in by the Department make it complicit in this.  They are trying to put a bush in every gap.  Everywhere one turns there are more regulations.

Officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were before us.  The Department did a public sector standards briefing on the Bill in the audiovisual room.  I was the only member of the Oireachtas present.  At the time, there did not seem to be that much concern.  Only for the Chairman, me and a number of other members of this committee saying it was not going any further until we had a response, there would have been a different outcome.  We were told by the Department that it wrote to the delegates and that they did not respond.  That is what we heard although it is clear the delegates sent us the submissions they made.  We do not know where they went, therefore.  They went into the Department but the Minister says he never got them or saw them.  There was no reaction and everything was regarded as fine.  The legislation was approved just before the last general election so many of us were not Members at the time.  It is deeply flawed in how it is put together and how it will work in practice.  I refer to declaring everything one owns every three or four months and having to record all one's assets, with the possibility of having to go before some kind of investigation or tribunal, through no fault of one&rsquo;s own, if one accidentally leaves something out.  One could end up being prosecuted and in jail.  Of course there should be sanctions for genuine wrongdoing and the abuse of one's position.  When the Revenue Commissioners have access to all the information anyway and one declares it all to them when calculating one's income tax, why the involvement of SIPO, or whatever it will be named in the future?  If it were not for the Chairman and many members of the committee saying there was to be no further progress further until they heard a response, the delegates would not have been brought in.  Neither AILG nor LAMA would be here.  I commend the Chairman in this regard.  I commend all the members who sat diligently with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who said all was fine, that everyone was happy, that there is no issue with the legislation and that everyone wanted to get it through as fast as they could.  There is a huge administrative burden for people who are trying to engage in local government, most with another job.  Who can live and raise a family on &euro;16,000 a year before paying PRSI and the universal social charge?  As stated, the PRSI class, involving a payment rate of 4%, gave nothing.

We now have the delegates' input and we can go back to the Department with it and say people are not happy and that we need a more streamlined, easy method with an explanation as to why work needs to be duplicated or triplicated.<\/p><p>I thank all the delegates for attending.  None of them is being paid to be here.  I thank the four councillors who are here, Mr. Tom Moylan and Mr. Liam Kenny for all their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112100002#R00200","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511280000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Amendments may be tabled on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.

I spent 25 years in local government from 1979.  I served half the time with my father.  Councillor McEntire met him over the years.  I have a deep understanding of local government and the commitment people make to improve their communities.  However, in the context of the Bill, this is a national issue.  Councillors from all over the country will, therefore, rely heavily on the two bodies that represent them.  I wish to put that in context because this House has changed dramatically over the years and the responsibility of the national representative bodies, inside or outside politics, has become far more important than it used to be, particularly in the context of influencing legislation such as the Bill under discussion.  On a Tuesday or Wednesday, one could meet a lobbyist from any quarter in this building.  Lobbyists are constantly making efforts to change Bills, insert provisions in them and make them better for their own sector.  The delegates' organisations have to be far more vigilant in this regard.  I say that constructively and in the context of how this Bill was developed and came before us.<\/p> <p>  There are measures in this Bill that I believe the delegates have not addressed.  They need to be addressed.  Senator Paddy Burke stated there is a need for the delegates to examine the Bill in the context of suggesting amendments or improvements.  The Bill does not just affect local authorities but also all of us in these Houses.  The Bill is about the office of a public sector standards commissioner.  One can say what one likes about SIPO but it has been helpful in its interpretation of matters and one can speak to its officials.  The proposed body is a different office.  A range of powers are to be given to the commissioner that are way above and beyond those of SIPO.  One needs to understand that.  The delegates highlighted in their contributions how this Bill affects them practically but they should examine the strength and powers of the commissioner also because, regardless of our discussion, this legislation will be implemented in some shape or form.  All of us in the room acknowledge the reasons it has to be implemented.<\/p> <p>  The delegates stated income in excess of &euro;2,600 is a declarable interest.  They referred to the source of any income related to a consultant or adviser and to contracts and interests of public officials.  The legislation sets out the incomes in excess of which one has to file a report.  The legislation refers to shares, bonds and holdings, in addition to public and private information.  The body of the Bill refers to any interest being an interest of the spouse or child of the public official concerned.<\/p><p>The person is being asked not only to account for themselves but for others who may not want to be accountable to them.  That is a fact.  It further suggests the values and what they exceed and how they should be reported.  It refers to <i>ad hoc<\/i>arrangements if a person wants to make a declaration in the course of the year.  That only draws attention to something that can be interpreted as something the person did wrong.  I do not understand why it cannot be a year on year declaration when there is an understanding within the Bill of the problems that can be caused, whether by mischief or otherwise or the interpretation of the press or otherwise.  None of that seems to be understood in the Bill.  It seems to be a case that we are all guilty of something or other because of the sins of the past, not because of what we are doing today.  <br\/><br\/>To highlight what I regard as the extreme parts of the Bill, it refers to examining the interests of people other than a person's immediate family, a brother or a sister.  I know what mine would tell me.  Part of the Bill which we have questioned involves a disclosure on legal or medical services, including psychiatric and psychological services.  It goes on to deal with the powers of the commissioner.<br\/><br\/>This meeting is the start of a process.  There is much more in the Bill that the delegates have not had time to examine and that will have a serious impact on their members and the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I want to disclose.  I want to comply with the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, but I do not want someone to peer into aspects of my life such as bank balances and current accounts.  There is a limit to all of this.  Members of the Houses must examine it, but the delegates' organisations must examine it in far more detail and come back with their suggestions, amendments or appropriate commentary on its overall direction.<br\/><br\/>Time is important because there is urgency on the part of the Minister and others in the House to bring the Bill to a conclusion.  It is a start of the examination.  We will send the Official Report on proceedings at this meeting to the Department and the Minister and the delegates' first go at their submission, but we will say they may come back with more information.  Each political party will be encouraged to examine the Bill and put forward its amendments. <br\/><br\/>I acknowledge the work councillors do.  It is underrated and not appreciated.  The method the Oireachtas has come at during the tenure of successive Governments is not fair in respect of how they are remunerated and their expenses offset.  It should be far more clear andtransparent and show more appreciation of the work councillors do.  That should be reflected in how they are paid.  The more democracy has developed at local and national level the greater the onus has been on local government members to comply with all of this stuff.  We need to recognise the cost of that compliance and the onerous task it now is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112100002#S00300","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511280000,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I welcome the councillors and their colleagues.  We make declarations every year, although my circumstances do not change from year to year.  I would love to see a simple form that asks whether anything has changed in a person's circumstances from the commencement of their time as a councillor.  That would be logical.  If a person has bought or sold land, for example, he or she should include that information, but he or she should not have to go through the whole rigmarole and get a peace commissioner to sign it.<\/p><p>It would be good if we could bring about some change in that regard because we are inundated with paper and do the same thing every year when I respond with the same information.  There has been no change from five years ago and I am sure it is the same for councillors.  If a councillor has a house, a piece of ground or a business, that information is declared.<\/p><p> The delegates and their organisations are very influential.  I ask them to, please, simplify things and cut out the nonsense because the information is declared on the first day a person is elected to the county council for a five-year term.  If he or she is asked each year whether there has been a change in his or her circumstances and he or she says \"No\" when there has been a change, he or she could be in difficulty if something is unearthed.  Only a small amount of housekeeping is needed.  This also applies to Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Next January I will go through the same things again, giving every little detail which has to be signed by a peace commissioner, but what is the point? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112100002#T00200","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511280000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>That is the point.
