The evidence is that the increase in employment in the past two years has been in full-time posts.  The number of part-time posts has fallen somewhat.  At the beginning of the recession there was a surge in the number of part-time jobs, but that naturally led to a period during which the level of part-time work started to fall and full-time work opportunities emerged.

That is why the Government is placing an increased emphasis on supporting jobs growth in the regions.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that all regions have shown growth, in contrast to what Deputy Calleary has tried to say in his opening comments.  In February, the Government announced details of the Action Plan for Jobs: Regional Initiative.  It might sound like an airline but I can tell the Deputy that it will deliver on the ground, which is more important.  It seeks to build on the existing strengths and assets of each region to maximise enterprise growth and job creation.  This initiative will see action plans drawn up for eight regions at NUTS III level, supported by a package of up to &euro;250 million in funding over the next five years. <\/p>  <p>  The Western Development Commission&rsquo;s report on the western region&rsquo;s labour market will provide a valuable input into this work.  Using data up to the first quarter of 2014, it showed growth in employment in the seven counties covered since the start of 2012 with a significant drop in unemployment.  In particular it showed growth in employment in agriculture, professional, retail, hospitality, industry, construction and private services, but a decline in employment in public service, financial, ICT and transport.  While overall jobs growth in these counties was lower than in the rest of the country, they had a stronger jobs experience in five sectors.  The relative strength of these counties in manufacturing and weakness in ICT was observed.  This is valuable input into the work of identifying areas of opportunity for these counties, which can be developed in the regional action plans for jobs. <\/p>  <p>  As I have said, through the regional action plans for jobs we want to build on strengths and opportunities in the different regions, whether in existing or emerging sectors such as the creative industries or renewable energy, which are of particular interest to the western region.

In addition, a wide range of training and educational initiatives are underway by the relevant providers, such as Skillnets.

The reference to no \"particular application or use in view\" is crucial, as the performer may not know about actual applications when doing the research or responding to survey questionnaires.  The results of basic research are not generally sold, but are usually published in scientific journals or circulated to interested colleagues.  Occasionally, basic research may be classified for security reasons.<\/p>  <p>  In basic research, scientists have some freedom to set their own goals.  Such research is usually performed in the higher education sector, but also to some extent in the government sector.  Basic research can be oriented or directed towards some broad fields of general interest, with the explicit goal of a broad range of applications in the future.  One example is the public research programmes on nanotechnology, which several countries have decided on.  Firms in the private sector may also undertake basic research with a view to preparing for the next generation of technology.  Through many of our research centres, particularly the one in Cork, we are bringing enterprise and the State together to carry out this research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300010#H00700","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1431510000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I do not know whether it was the accent or the sound in the Chamber-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300010#H00800","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1431510000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>It was probably the accent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300010#H00900","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1431510000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>-----but I found it difficult to follow the Minister of State's answer.  It seems convenient that we have subsumed pure basic research under the umbrella of oriented basic research when the latter is really applied research.  The amount of investment in the former has fallen disproportionately.  The issue that the scientific community and even the business community is putting to the Government is that its science strategy is imbalanced.  There will be a serious problem for society unless this is addressed.  The international standard that we developed before 2012 is in danger of being eroded.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's consultation process on a replacement for the science, technology and innovation strategy was rushed, although it received 77 submissions.  Will the Minister of State address the point on the range of bodies that have expressed concern?  The Institute of Physics in Ireland, the Medical Research Charities Group, the Royal Irish Academy and the Health Research Board have stated that the relentless focus on research prioritisation poses dangers for our economy.

The last time we discussed this matter, the Minister did not shift away from that.  It is the nub of the problem.  No one is saying that the Government should not care about jobs.  That is fine.  Instead, people are saying that there is a serious imbalance.  Everything that the Minister and Minister of State have said seems to indicate that they are entrenching this viewpoint.  It is lunacy.  They are the only people in the economic and scientific communities who have that view.  Studies show that there was 54% basic research spend in 2010 and 2011.  There is an amalgamated figure for the 2012-13 period, but it decreased by a couple of percentage points.  They key figure will be the 2013-14 one.

Under successive Governments during the past ten or 15 years, Ireland has built an important and world-recognised research ecosystem.  We will continue building on that for Ireland's reputation.  We are high achievers in many sectors.  However, we also take an important view on job creation.  We are proud of this and will not move away from it, so it is a question of working the two elements together.  We recognise that, to have applied research, one needs basic research.

I raise this matter in the context of the fact that two infants died in the same hospital in 2014 and another in November 2012.  Last May the then Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, announced in a press release that he would instruct HIQA to review and pay particular attention to maternity services at Cavan General Hospital and said the use of an external agency was essential to bring objectivity to the review.  However, it now appears that no formal order was made to instruct HIQA to investigate the unit and no review was carried out.  Will the Taoiseach explain why that is the case?<\/p><p>In its report on Portlaoise hospital HIQA stated in its recommendation:<blockquote>The Department of Health must now develop a national maternity services strategy for Ireland, as specified in recommendation N7 of the Authority's October 2013 <i>Investigation into the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the Health Service Executive to patients, including pregnant women at risk of clinical deterioration, including those provided in University Hospital Galway, and reflected in the care and treatment provided to Savita Halappanaver.<\/i><\/blockquote>The report the Minister received on 7 April on Portlaoise hospital goes on to state the development of this strategy does not appear to have progressed substantially in the intervening period and that as a result of the investigation, the investigators believe such a strategy must be supported by a nationally mandated maternity care service.  Will the Taoiseach tell us what is happening?  A year ago the Minister announced ago that HIQA would investigate maternity services at Cavan General Hospital but no order was issued to HIQA and nothing happened.  Over two years ago, following Savita Halappanaver's untimely death, a national maternity strategy was ordered but nothing happened until HIQA's report landed on the desk of the Minister two weeks ago.  Two weeks later a steering group was announced.  This raises a fundamental question.  At the highest level, arising from HIQA's investigations, the Department and the Government were asked to conduct a national review of the safety of maternity services but that did not happen.

The HSE is investigating the background and cause of this death and I do not wish to comment further until the facts about what happened are known.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA's report on Portlaoise hospital has implications for maternity services throughout the country.  With regard to Cavan General Hospital, I understand that, following the death of the third baby in May 2014, the then Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, wrote to HIQA on 14 May, requesting it to prioritise the monitoring of the maternity unit at Cavan General Hospital against the national standards to ensure safer and better health care, as part of the overall response to the Chief Medical Officer's report on maternity services in Portlaoise.  HIQA subsequently sought a detailed report on the three cases involved and it was provided by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the wider implications of the national issues in maternity services highlighted in the Chief Medical Officer's report and as reflected in the terms of reference for the investigation at Portlaoise hospital, HIQA has started a focused programme of monitoring of compliance against the national standards to ensure safer and better health care across maternity services nationally.  The programme includes the maternity services provided at Cavan General Hospital.  That work has started and will be completed by the end of the year.  Today representatives of HIQA are attending the Joint Committee on Health and Children, where I am sure this matter will be discussed in further detail by the representatives.  <\/p>  <p>  Because of his concerns about maternity services, the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who is in Portlaoise General Hospital today to meet the bereaved parents of the babies who lost their lives and staff has decided to establish a national women's and infants' health programme to address and improve maternity services across the country.  The programme will provide for a cross-sectoral framework for governance, integration and leadership to drive reform and standardise health care services across the 19 maternity units in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300017#Q00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1431514200,"counter":442,"content":"<p>It is clear that the then Minister did not order a probe as such at Cavan General Hospital.

As the Taoiseach will recall, it was a major issue at the time and there was huge controversy surrounding the case.  It was clear back then that there was a need for a national maternity strategy to be developed.  We then had the inquiry in Portlaoise by HIQA and one of its conclusions was that the Minister and the Department of Health had not followed through on a key recommendation made in the Savita Halappanaver inquiry.  HIQA's report on Portlaoise hospital went on to state it had found the fact that it had not happened unacceptable, indicating: \"The Authority considers the delay in developing and publishing a national maternity strategy unacceptable.\"  The report was published in April, after the report on Portlaoise hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Some say it is a scandal that no action followed the Savita Halappanaver inquiry.<\/p><p>The e-mail from which I quoted yesterday from the national incident management team stated there were numerous sad and serious cases in all sites across the country.

I extend my sympathy to the parents of the child, the family and others who have suffered such dreadful loss.  This news comes on the back of last week's publication of the HIQA report on the safety of services in the Midland Regional Hospital.  I ask the Taoiseach to listen to this quotation from the report: \"HIQA found that the hospital was not governed, resourced or equipped to provide 24-hour, 7-day acute surgery, accident and emergency and maternity services\".  The national incident management team has also said that it is aware of other \"numerous sad and serious cases at all HSE sites\".  HIQA goes on to make the point that if the findings of previous HIQA recommendations had been implemented the risks to patients would have been vastly reduced.  This is not the first time that HIQA has made this point.  It made the point directly with the HSE and with the Department of Health.  <\/p>  <p>  I have raised this matter many times with the Taoiseach in this Chamber and I have given him a letter from HIQA enumerating its concerns.  The charge from HIQA and the NIMT could not be more serious.  The harsh reality is that these recommendations are being continuously ignored and have been ignored for a long time by the HSE and the Department of Health.  That is the nub of this problem.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that the HSE is obliged to take prompt action to implement recommendations made by regulatory bodies such as HIQA?  If so, why did it not do this?  Does he accept also that this is the explicit responsibility of the Department of Health and the Minister for Health?  Can he explain why the HSE, the Department of Health and the Minister failed to act on these recommendations?  There is bound to be an explanation.  Could the D&aacute;il and the public be given it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300018#R01000","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1431514800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I accept that the imperative now is to implement the recommendations arising from the HIQA report into the situation at Portlaoise.  They have been accepted by the Department of Health and the HSE and will have implications for other hospitals in terms of demonstrating that the standards of competence and service available in the 19 maternity units around the country are of the highest order.<\/p>  <p>  The decision made by the Government to transfer the health Vote into the Department of Health, so that the Minister is responsible and accountable, gives a much greater opportunity to determine where moneys are spent to ensure the adequacy of staffing and resources.  The grouping of hospitals is also much better than having individual hospital entities around the country competing, as they did for so many years, for their own set of services and having to make their case each year.  The fact that difficult choices were not faced up to for very many years has led to a range of services that, in some cases, have proven not to be of the highest standard.  When Professor O'Higgins proposed centres of excellence for cancer a great deal of anxiety was expressed and there were public marches on the proposal.  However those people, particularly women and families, who have had the traumatic experience of having to go to a centre of excellence for cancer treatment have found that outcomes are much more specific and relevant and it has proven that the decision to put the patient at the centre of the strategy was right.  It means a lot to women who have gone through the trauma of breast cancer to see the capacity in a centre of excellence for the highest level of expertise and treatment.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also said nothing had happened in respect of Portlaoise.  On Leaders' Questions yesterday I dealt with the measures put in place in Portlaoise in the past 12 months, such as the new management and the memorandum of understanding signed with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.  Portlaoise is now part of the midlands strategy in terms of maternity services and is linked with the Coombe.  An equality and patient safety position for maternity services has been filled, risk management has been strengthened, there are 16 additional midwives in place and a director of midwifery has been appointed.  As I said yesterday, the recommendations of the recent HIQA report are all accepted.  The training that was put in place had a full attendance from midwifery staff.<\/p><p> As I said, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, is in Portlaoise today meeting the parents who have lost babies so tragically and also the hospital personnel.  The bluntness of the HIQA report brings into stark focus the inadequacies of a system that has grown over the years and that must be adjusted so that people can feel comfortable and happy that our maternity units have the safest standards possible for expectant mothers to give birth to their babies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300018#R01100","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431515400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I hope the steps the Minister is taking regarding Portlaoise hospital are adequate and I wish him well.

My question was why the recommendations were not acted on.  This is too serious an issue for us to play politics with.  What is the point of HIQA?  The Taoiseach may claim he did not know about the recommendations.  I walked across the Chamber and handed him a letter from HIQA which detailed the recommendations it made in the Tallaght report.  It made other recommendations regarding the Savita Halappanavar case, and they were not acted on.  The Taoiseach has said the Government will act on them.  We are being told the problems are being found in other hospitals, including Cavan General Hospital.  Contrary to the Taoiseach's response to the earlier question about the Minister for Health and an investigation, although last May the Minister said he wanted a HIQA investigation into Cavan hospital in addition to the investigation into Portlaoise hospital that was ongoing, he never formally ordered the investigation and therefore there was no review.  Why was there no review?  Why did the Minister not act on his public statement and follow through, as was his responsibility?<\/p>  <p>  I constantly make the case here that the Government's austerity policies are decimating the health services.  Now, we can see the outworking of the dysfunctional approach which does not see health as a public service and an entitlement of citizens.  One example is the fact that an extra 600 midwives are required and that the number of midwives available to pregnant women is dangerously low.  How many more damning HIQA reports will be ignored?  When will the Government publish legislation to extend the remit of HIQA, as the Minister promised?  Will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to reassure people?  People know the recommendations were not acted on.  It is always better to give people what the Taoiseach has mentioned many times, namely, clarity and information.  Will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to explain why the Minister, Department and HSE failed to implement HIQA's recommendations?  None of the Ministers for Health involved in any of the HIQA reports disagreed with the recommendations.  They all said they would act on them.  However, they did not.

The point of HIQA is that it is an independent authority that can walk into a hospital and analyse, investigate and assess any sector or service.  The Minister is entitled to request that HIQA produce a report and he wrote to HIQA on 14 May 2014 requesting that it examine the maternity unit in Cavan hospital.

Otherwise, the Taoiseach would be shouting from the roof-tops that people were accepting the charges and we would not be faced with the bogeyman of legislation that is always just around the corner but never arrives.  On 3 February, the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that the legislation would be ready in the next couple of weeks.  More than a couple of weeks later, on 25 March, he told the D&aacute;il it would be introduced in a few weeks' time.  A few weeks have passed, and yesterday, he told the D&aacute;il it would be enacted before the House rises in July.  At this rate, Godot himself may ramble by before any legislation comes before the House.  Is the delay deliberate?  Is it part of a dishonest plan designed to scare people and cynically timed to happen at the same time as the bills are dropping into letter-boxes?  Is it intended to created the impression that it will enable Irish Water to reach into people's wages, benefits or pensions and deduct water charges, ably assisted by sections of the media?<\/p>  <p>  The impression is untrue.  It is clear the Irish Water cannot and will not be given any such power.  According to the Law Reform Commission report, Irish Water is a company; it is not the Revenue Commissioners.  It would have to go to court to seek attachment orders.  We have been here before.  In the 1990s, people were taken to court for non-payment of water charges and were threatened with disconnection.  There were protests at the courts, which were clogged with non-payers.  It proved seriously politically embarrassing for the then Government, which did not break mass non-payment, and the water charges were abolished.  Court action cannot break mass non-payment now either.  The Courts Service has said it would not be able to deal with the excessive burden.  Perhaps this is the explanation for the haste with which Denis O'Brien got down to the courts before they clog up with water charges protesters.  It would be political suicide to pursue court cases before a general election.  The situation remains exactly as before, with no penalties for non-payment until July 2016, after the general election.  Mass non-payment can sink the water charges.  What are the figures?

As backup to the Bill, the Customs Bill was listed as a secondary element in the week's business.  Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson was not present this morning.

It was to have that Bill listed for discussion to deal with the 238 amendments which had been made to it during the course of this week.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, was present this morning and the discussion lasted for one hour and 15 minutes.

It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to come into the House and unilaterally make an announcement on specific questions which I wanted to ask and ask now.<\/p>  <p>  In January the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, outlined health priorities.  He promised new legislation to deal with a range of issues, including reducing the number of delayed discharges.

They followed a similar pattern.  On the platform was a group of overpaid executives.  Off the platform in the audience was a crowd of battered shareholders who had had a difficult time in recent years.  In the background was a history of exorbitant standard variable rate mortgages.  Both banks have executed a punitive regime on their customers in terms of standard variable rate mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  At the time, the banks also had a fourth important characteristic in common, that being, the largest shareholder in AIB, the Minister for Finance.  On behalf of the State, he held 99.8% in AIB and 14% in Bank of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  This was a heaven sent opportunity for the Minister, particularly given the AGMs' timing, to extract extraordinary leverage on those directors and banks to do something about reducing standard variable rate mortgages.  He bottled it.  At the end of both AGMs, we found out that the Minister had unfortunately cast in favour of all board resolutions.  In the case of AIB, these included an increase in the remuneration of the chair by 33% on last year, from &euro;275,000 to &euro;365,000.  When standard variable rate mortgage holders are suffering so much, this seems inappropriate.  It seems even more inappropriate that the Minister should be casting those votes in the board's favour at a time when the shareholders were suffering so much.  An almost bankrupt State voted for an almost bankrupt bank.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot understand why the Minister did not instead tell the board that not only would he not vote for members' remuneration, but that he would not vote for them to be re-elected.  He cast his and our votes in favour of re-electing every director at a time when they were approving this policy, eyeballing him and telling him that, no, they would go ahead and do what they liked.  The Minister had a great chance.  Unfortunately, he did not take advantage of it.<\/p>  <p>  Why did he not do this?  What motivated him to vote for these incredible salaries?  I believe that I am right in saying that every non-executive at AIB received at least &euro;80,000 in 2014.  How that remuneration was earned differed.  Sometimes, it was by way of salary because people sat on board committees.  At the end of the day, though, they were all getting more than &euro;80,000 per year, the chairman is now getting &euro;365,000 per year, standard variable rate mortgage holders are suffering and the directors are milking the bank.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister should have taken the opportunity to tell them that they would all be gone unless they executed the policy that he wanted, one that he is now trying to force on them, namely, taking the board's foot off the throats of standard variable rate mortgage holders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300026#AA00200","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1431519000,"counter":815,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300026#AA00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1431519000,"counter":816,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ross for tabling this Topical Issue and for the opportunity it provides me to respond on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  Let me be clear - the Minister has not bottled anything.  He has put in place a clear process in respect of standard variable rates.  He has made his own views clear on the records of the House and in many other places, as have the Taoiseach and I during debates in the House.  The Central Bank's report on standard variable rates is with the Department of Finance and will be considered by the Minister, who will meet the main banks next week to discuss the issue.  A process is in place and I ask that the Deputy not pre-empt the outcome.<\/p>  <p>  The resolutions across AIB and Bank of Ireland covered a number of broad areas: the consideration of the report of the directors, the auditors' report and the accounts for 2014; director-related resolutions, including reports on the directors' remuneration and their re-election; authorisation for the directors to fix the remuneration of the auditors; and technical resolutions allowing the directors certain authorisations relating to the issuance of shares.<\/p>  <p>  Before recommending how the Minister should vote, officials in the Department analysed each of these resolutions.  The Deputy made it sound as if the Minister or his proxy just turned up and decided out of the blue.  As part of the analysis, officials took into account the fact that ISS proxy advisory services, an expert independent firm that advises institutional shareholders on how to cast their votes at general meetings, recommended that shareholders vote in favour of the Bank of Ireland resolutions.  The conclusion of this analysis indicated no reason to vote against the resolutions that dealt with the report of the directors, the auditors' report, the accounts, the remuneration of the auditors or authorisations relating to the issuance of shares.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the resolutions on directors' remuneration and the re-election of directors, in the normal course investors would vote in favour of such resolutions unless they were dissatisfied with the performance of such directors.  It is important that we update our language as regards the banking situation because AIB and Bank of Ireland recorded strong financial results for 2014.  Highlights of these results included a significant return to profitability since the onset of the crisis, impressive capital build, significant growth in new lending and good progress in reducing non-performing loans across all portfolios.<\/p>  <p>  The State remains the largest shareholder in Bank of Ireland, with a current minority shareholding of 14%.  It is worth noting that, including the State, investors voted overwhelmingly in favour of all Bank of Ireland resolutions within a range of 93.11% to 99.96%.  Resolution No. 2, which was to consider the report on directors' remuneration, was passed with 99.73% of votes.<\/p>  <p>  Shareholders in both banks were asked to vote on resolutions covering the receipt or consideration of the directors' remuneration reports.  The report is contained in the annual report and accounts of each institution.  The acceptance or rejection of these resolutions has no impact on the actual remuneration received by each of the directors.<\/p>  <p>  At the 2014 AIB AGM, shareholders were asked to vote on changes in the structure of non-executive directors' remuneration.  These changes moved the remuneration from a fee-per-meeting basis to a fixed annual fee for board membership and an additional fixed fee for membership of each board committee.  These changes reduced the amount paid to AIB Group directors by &euro;39,000 versus 2013.<\/p>  <p>  In Bank of Ireland, total directors' remuneration in 2014 was &euro;2.76 million, down marginally on the 2013 total of &euro;2.77 million.  Within this total, it is worth noting the following: total remuneration costs, including pension contributions where applicable, for the two executive directors and the governor and deputy governor remained unchanged year on year.  Since May 2009, the group CEO has waived a portion of his salary to the sum of &euro;67,000.  In addition, in 2014 he waived &euro;51,000 of his pension accrual for the year, resulting in the pension cost to the bank being the same as the cost in 2013.  Against this backdrop, to vote against the proposed resolution on directors' remuneration would have been a significant and serious matter and could be perceived as interfering in a commercial entity that could do damage to Ireland and - the Deputy referred to shareholders, the taxpayers - the value of our bank investments.  Accordingly, the Minister decided that it was appropriate to vote in favour of these resolutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300026#AA00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1431519600,"counter":817,"content":"<p>I have rarely heard a weaker case made in this House for bankers&rsquo; pay.  I am not surprised and do not blame the Minister of State because he is carrying the can for a decision that was made elsewhere.  I am not surprised to hear him state aggregate levels have gone down slightly.  The fact is that he did not address the issue.  How can he support an increase of 33% in the pay of the AIB chair?  The profits he quotes are questionable.  He knows that because it has a lot to do with what one allows for bad debts and how one provides for them.  One can control the banks' profits.  They made huge reductions, which are questionable this time, but the chairman got a 33% increase.  That is not excusable at this time.<\/p>  <p>  Consider the Minister of State's statement that 99% of investors voted in favour of the decision.  He is correct in the case of the Bank of Ireland.  In the case of AIB, 100% voted in favour of the decision, which was even worse.  It is disingenuous for the Minister of State to say here that the shareholders voted in favour of the decision.  He, and certainly whoever wrote his script, well know that the big shareholders are the people who voted.  A vote by the small shareholders would certainly result in a large majority voting against the pay. The chairman of Bank of Ireland gets a lot more than the chairman of AIB.  He gets &euro;490,000 in a remuneration package.  He is a man who, with the chairman of AIB, is simply a refuge from British banking.  The United Kingdom is where they were found.  Neither of them was wanted in the United Kingdom.  They land over here and get huge sums of money, &euro;500,000 per year in one case.  That is inexcusable.

It was founded in 2012 by the housing association Respond! and has provided a safe harbour for some 64 for women and 84 children since then.  It is a refuge with a difference in so much as it is a second-stage facility designed to provide temporary accommodation and advice to women referred by emergency refuges or other State agencies.  Without such a facility, women and children have no choice but to return to abusive partners or be allocated to accommodation for the homeless.  Expert opinion suggests the service is necessary and value for money.<\/p>  <p>  Respond! undertook in 2012 to fund this service for three years.  It can no longer do so.  The annual cost is somewhere between &euro;320,000 and &euro;350,000.  Respond! is now confronted by what it says is an unavoidable decision, to close Cuan &Aacute;lainn.  State agencies, including Tusla, accept that Respond! has identified a definite need to care for women and children who must move on from emergency refuges.  The typical stay may be from six to nine months while alternative arrangements are made to procure housing for the women and children concerned.  I accept the budgetary situation remains difficult and that, in particular, the Tusla budget is under pressure.

By way of being helpful, I suggest respectfully that, in the short term, he engage with his colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to examine whether it is within the competence of both Departments to save the service from closure.

Cuan &Aacute;lainn, as Deputy Rabbitte has said, provides second-stage accommodation for women and children who are experiencing domestic violence and who may have been in emergency accommodation.   The centre opened in 2012 and is funded by Respond! Housing Association.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, allocates available funding for domestic violence to emergency refuge accommodation services and community-based domestic violence supports.  Tusla endorses the use of second-stage refuge and supported accommodation to enable people to move on from emergency accommodation.  While it does not currently fund such services, it has indicated that it hopes to support them in the future based on the direction it intends to pursue.  Tusla met Respond! recently and advised that, as matters stand, it is not in a position to fund this service in the current year.<\/p>  <p>  It might be helpful for Members if I share some background to the arrangements for dealing with this issue at a strategic level.<\/p><p>Due to the complex nature of the issues involved in domestic and sexual based violence, and the need for a co\u00adordinated and effective response to these issues, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence was established as an executive office in the Department of Justice and Equality in 2007 and that Department currently has overall policy responsibility in this area.  It has formulated a comprehensive cross-Government strategy, which combines the efforts of a very broad range of organisations and individuals, to combat all forms of domestic, sexual and gender based violence.  The national office is currently in the process of finalising a new cross-sectoral strategy from 2015 onwards.<\/p> <p> In terms of service delivery, Tusla which was established on 1 January 2014, has taken on responsibility for the provision of domestic, sexual and gender based violence services which were  previously funded by the HSE.  For the first time this service is under national direction.  We now have a single line of accountability and a consolidated national budget which is reserved for allocation to these particular services.  Domestic, sexual and gender based violence services can now be delivered within a broad child and family support framework and this represents a significant change to the previous service delivery model.  <\/p> <p> Tusla will continue to work closely with service providers to ensure that women and children fleeing domestic abuse receive all necessary support and the position in respect of the Cuan Alainn service will be kept under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300027#BB01300","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431520200,"counter":831,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  It seems that the broad orientation of policy he outlined is probably correct.  The tragedy, however, is that if we let this facility close it would be very difficult to re-establish it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State made the point in his response that Tusla has indicated that it would hope to support such services in the future but in 2015 this particular refuge is in crisis.  The funding required to keep it open for the remaining half of the year is not a very large amount.  It was suppose to close down in March, as the commitment given was that it would be funded for three years.  We are up against it now as we face into the remaining half of the year.  <\/p>  <p>  I did not appreciate fully that there is a role, as envisaged here, for the Department of Justice and Equality.  Respond! has also a connection evidently with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I know things are tight.  I hear their lordships on radio complaining that the cut in the Tusla funding to Accord is retaliation by the Government because of the prominent role of some Catholic prelates in the equality referendum.  They seem prepared to ignore the assurance of the Minister that it was not so.  The refuge in Tallaght certainly is not involved in the referendum.  That is not the reason funding is being cut.  It is clear to everybody, and ought to be clear to their lordships, that Tusla has a funding problem, having taken over new responsibilities this year.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of this particular initiative by Respond! which is acknowledged by all the agencies involved, by the HSE, the emergency refuges around south Dublin and the county council, as being a splendid service where women fleeing domestic violence, who do not have any other alternative except to go back to the abusive partner, have a facility to move on while housing is being procured for them.  It is a very valuable initiative.  It represents value for money.  The alternative would cost the State more.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to engage with the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to see if a half year's funding for the refuge can be put together while the new model of service he spoke about can be settled on by the respective Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300028#CC00200","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1431520200,"counter":832,"content":"<p>I would agree with the Deputy's comments.

When it was selected I had a four-minute speech prepared outlining the background to this issue and then I thought what is the point of doing that as anybody who does any background check will find all the parliamentary questions that have been tabled on the issue.  I would say it has been raised by every Deputy in the House at some stage during the past year.  Therefore, I will not bore the Minister of State with the background story to this issue, of which she is only too well aware.<\/p>  <p>  Like every other Deputy, I have been contacted by numerous people in recent weeks and months.  It is only when reads of or listens to the human stories of the people involved that one fully understands how the non-availability of this drug is impacting on people's lives.  I was contacted recently by one woman whose life has been significantly curtailed since she finished on the drug.  She can no longer walk as far as she once could and her balance is greatly affected, which makes her more fearful in terms of walking and greatly reduces her independence.  Another woman who wrote to me spoke of her anger at being failed by the State, particularly as she knows that many others are in a similar position, having their lives curtailed because of decisions made purely on economic grounds when there is a very human cost to these decisions.  <\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State is very well aware of this issue.  The first Topical Issue debate on this issue took place on 10 June last year but responses to parliamentary questions on 6 May of this year  indicate that this issue has not been moved forward much on the basis that the responses state that the company has re-applied again to submit this drug under the schemes and that the Department and the HSE are working with it.  The problem is that this has been going on for a year at this stage.  Multiple sclerosis sufferers are no further along the line of knowing what the Government can do in their cases and their lives are being terribly curtailed and impacted by the lack of information.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like to find out today where those negotiations are at.  If the problem is with the pharmaceutical company that is involved, it is important that we would know that.  Who is handling the negotiations?  When was the last date a meeting took place on this issue?  Is it possible to move this topic on, even a little today, for us to be able to say to multiple sclerosis sufferers that we are concerned about where we are at with this process.  <\/p>  <p>  I know full well that the drug does not work for everybody but for those for whom it does work, it seems to be a life-changing experience for them.  We must be careful and understand that if we can make a difference in one person's life, it would be a major achievement if we could get this drug included under one of the free schemes.  I understand the Department of Health more than any other Department has huge cost containment issues because everybody wants to get the drug that will help save their lives included under the schemes, but if the inclusion of this drug can help change even one person's life, including those women I mentioned in Galway, I would urge the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar and the Government to get this drug included under the scheme as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300028#CC00400","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1431520200,"counter":835,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  He is right in saying that it has been raised on numerous occasions.  It is not as if we are unaware of or sympathetic to the circumstances in which people find themselves.  We have personal experience of this in that we know people who are desperately awaiting some relief in respect of this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Decisions on which medicines are licensed for use in Ireland and which are reimbursed by the taxpayer are not political or ministerial decisions.  These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  At the outset I would like to clarify that fampridine, the brand name of which is Fampyra, was never available to multiple sclerosis patients under the general medical services and community drugs schemes.  However, I understand that the manufacturer of fampridine supplied the drug free of charge to some patients who were prescribed the drug by their clinician.<\/p><p>The manufacturer has stopped supplying the drug free of charge, thereby requiring patients to finance the drug if they wish to continue with the treatment.  <\/p> <p> The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drug schemes.  In accordance with agreed procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted an evaluation of the drug.  The evaluation, published in 2012, concluded that the centre was unable to recommend reimbursement of the product as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish health care setting.  On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the list of reimbursable items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes.  The manufacturer submitted a new application to the HSE on 25 July 2014 for the inclusion of Fampridine in the community drug schemes.  The HSE's corporate pharmaceutical unit has since been engaging with the company seeking improved commercial offerings and the HSE is considering the outcome of these commercial engagements.  It has also had discussions with clinical experts about this drug, the outcome of which is also being considered.  <\/p> <p> The HSE and I fully understand the concerns of patients about the availability of this drug, but it is not possible for the taxpayer to reimburse every licensed medicine at whatever price a drug company demands.  It is important that we get the best possible price for this drug which is of benefit to some people.  It is fully understood Fampridine benefits some, although not all, MS sufferers.  At the same time, it is our duty to ensure we get the best possible price for the taxpayer in this instance.  The negotiation process has concluded, but I am not saying that is the final word on the matter.  We are looking at the outcome of the negotiations but have not yet come to a final decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300028#CC00500","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431520800,"counter":837,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response, but the concern of MS sufferers all over the country is that her response has not changed a lot in the past six or 12 months.

I ask the Minister of State to give some indication as to when she believes we will get an answer to this question.  I am not looking for a specific date, but it is very important that some indication be given to MS sufferers who see no grounds for hope.  They cannot afford this drug which is simply too expensive.  To make matters worse, they saw the difference it had made to their lives but then it was taken away from them owing to the expense involved.  We cannot continue with a situation where all questions tabled by elected representatives on this issue are answered in the same way.  We cannot see the finish line.

It was both cruel and unfortunate for people who had obtained huge benefits from it when it was withdrawn.  We are still looking at the question of whether it is affordable.  That may sound cold and callous, but I do not mean it to come across in that way, as I understand the difference the drug has made to peoples' lives.  We are doing our very best to ensure something that will benefit people will be available to them.  However, there are cases where drugs are simply unaffordable.  I understand this might appear to be a harsh decision, but we have not given up.  We are still looking at the issue.

While I am sorry the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is not present, I understand the reason for his absence.<\/p>  <p>  It is very regrettable that I have to raise this issue and I know that the Minister of State agrees with me when I say that.  The death of another newborn child in Cavan General Hospital yesterday is a very serious and troubling matter.  This is the fourth newborn child to be lost in the maternity unit at the hospital in the past 30 months, within which time we have yet to see findings or recommendations in respect of any of the previous tragic outcomes.  That is compounding the serious impact all of these outcomes on the confidence of a dependent community in Cavan, Monaghan and neighbouring counties.  It is absolutely imperative that the Minister and his Department intervene immediately to ensure the reports under preparation following the conclusion of the investigations of those given the responsibility to carry them out are brought forward with all due speed and published.  In that way, people will have the opportunity to see the findings and recommendations made and very quickly thereafter the implementation of same.  It is very reasonable and understandable that many people in the constituency in which I live and I am honoured to represent believe because of the absence of findings and recommendations, including in the very first case, that of baby Jamie Flynn in November 2012, that the subsequent tragic outcomes could have been avoided if the full gamut of information had been available and the necessary steps taken.  Sadly, there was yet another case yesterday.  <\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State and the senior Minister to intervene with Dr. Peter McKenna, Professor Tom Mathews, Ms Dawn Johnson and Ms Margaret McGarry to encourage the employment of the maximum number of hours available to them and more, if possible, to expedite the conclusion of their investigations.  Let us not forget that this is the second investigation into this matter, as the report on the first investigation was suppressed by a decision of the High Court following a case taken by one of the practitioners directly involved.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also anxious to establish the nature of the engagement by the former Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, with HIQA when he announced publicly in Cavan that he would secure HIIQA's attention for the cases in Cavan, in association with the authority's investigation into and report on the tragic outcomes at the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise.  It appears from the information to hand that no such direct order was issued by the former Minister, despite his public commentary, and that HIQA has not carried out any investigation or paid any \"particular attention,\" to use his words, to the cases in Cavan in the intervening period.

I am sure the Deputy will agree that the Minister is right to meet them.<\/p><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and affording me the opportunity to offer my sincerest sympathies to the family at the centre of this sad incident.  I am very conscious of their personal tragedy, and do not, in any way, want to intrude on their privacy.  It is important at this time that we give the family the space to grieve and I am sure they are grieving.<\/p> <p> Of course, the HSE will undertake a review of the circumstances of the case and in so doing will follow the HSE incident management policy.  Pending the outcome of that review, it is not appropriate for me to make any further comments on the specific incident.  HIQA will conduct a focused programme of monitoring of compliance with the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare across maternity services nationally.  This programme will include the maternity unit at Cavan General Hospital and will be undertaken this year.<\/p> <p> Concerns were raised regarding maternity services in Cavan following the deaths of three babies between 2012 and 2014.  Following the death of the third baby in May 2014, the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, wrote to HIQA requesting that priority be given to a review of the maternity services in Cavan General Hospital against the national standards.  I understand that HIQA has made contact with the HSE and details of the three incidents have been furnished to the authority.<\/p> <p> With regard to the specific infant death referred to by the Deputy, the investigation into this tragic incident is still under way.  I can make no further comment at this time.  We are, of course, all too painfully aware of the events detailed in the HIQA report into maternity services at Portlaoise hospital.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, briefed this House on the findings of that report yesterday and Deputies will be aware of his views on the failings in our services as detailed in the report.<\/p> <p> I assure the House that action is being taken to address the serious concerns raised in the HIQA Portlaoise report.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has decided to establish a national women and infants health programme to address and improve maternity services across the country.  The programme will provide the cross-sectoral framework and the necessary governance, integration and leadership to drive reform and standardise care across all 19 maternity units.<\/p> <p> One of the Minister's priorities for 2015 is the publication of the national maternity strategy.  The strategy will provide the policy to underpin the women and infants health programme.  The steering group to advise on the strategy met for the first time last week and had a very useful engagement.  The group is expected to report to the Minister before the end of the year.  I believe it is expected in October.<\/p> <p> I wish to clarify one other issue before the Deputy stands up because I do not want him to be wasting his time.  I have a copy of a letter from the previous Minister for Health to Mr. Brian McEnery, the chairperson of HIQA.  It outlines the concerns over Cavan General Hospital's maternity unit and the events there.  In his letter the Minister requested HIQA to prioritise the monitoring of the maternity unit at Cavan General Hospital.  Unfortunately, that request, as far as I know, has not been carried out, but it would be re-emphasised at this time.<\/p> <p> Again not to have the Deputy wasting his time when he stands up for his second intervention let me also say that there is a very delicate balance over what Ministers can say to HIQA while not having that seen as an intrusion on its statutory and separated powers from Government.  That is a line we all tread every day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300029#DD00500","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431521400,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I assure the Minister of State that I never waste my time when I get the opportunity to speak in this House.

The sums involved are huge, with the Mahon tribunal costing in the region of $300 million.  We do not seem to learn lessons from them, however.  The usual finding is of systems failure but it takes an age to put new systems and legislation in place.  We tend to be reactive, and proactive legislation is long-fingered while we try to fix existing problems.  It is a source of great frustration that the key players seldom pay a significant price.  During the course of the last general election there was a strong desire for a democratic revolution which would usher in radical reform in politics and institutions.  It is seven years since the Mahon tribunal concluded its hearings and the new planning legislation has yet to be introduced.<\/p>  <p>  The financial costs goes beyond the cost of the tribunals.  Large tracts of land in Dublin were held back from development to increase their value, and the resulting shortage of available building land drove up the cost of housing.  Many of the people who purchased those houses are now struggling to pay off their loans.  I need not speak about the knock-on effect on lending institutions.  Significant costs are also incurred to provide services to a dispersed population, including public transport, water and wastewater, school and leisure facilities.  We must also consider the social cost for people who live far removed from their extended families, as well as the time consumed in commuting.<\/p>  <p>  This is not exclusively a Dublin issue.  A series of complaints about planning irregularities led the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to conduct inquiries into planning in various local authorities.  As a member of a county council since 1991, I am aware of the enormous pressure on the council to rezone land.  Planning issues were only rarely viewed in a strategic context and those of us who fought for a more strategic approach throughout the 1990s were called all sorts of names.  It was only when we managed to collaborate with the community that we were able to curb the worst excesses.  The one lesson that we seem to be incapable of learning is that history repeats itself.  We have to put robust legislation in place if we are to stop history repeating itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300031#GG00400","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1431522000,"counter":855,"content":"<p>I would like an hour to speak about housing because it is hard to know where to start.  Ireland is facing a massive housing crisis.  The Government did nothing about it for four years and I do not think it is doing anything serious about it now.  It is simply sticking a plaster on the issue while ignoring the underlying problems.  We do not have a housing strategy.  The Government must not be consulting the people who work in the industry because there are serious problems with housing provision in Ireland.  The new building control regulations introduced last year are a complete cop-out because the Government does not want to pay for independent supervision.  The cost has been passed to the architects, who will pass it on to the insurance company and it will in turn come back to the citizen.  What has been done with technologists and self-builds?  It is lunacy.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government told us he planned to build 18,000 social housing units by the end of 2017.  We are now learning that only a quarter of these will be council owned.  The Minister was being deceptive.  We need to build a considerable number of social housing units.  The State has not engaged in providing social housing for a long time but it needs to start doing so because people will no longer be purchasing houses to the extent that they did in the past.  They will not be able to get the financing and the properties will be too expensive.  I do not understand the logic behind the Government's argument.  It is more spin than anything else.<\/p>  <p>  Kennedy Wilson, the North American company which purchased a number of distressed assets and formed a cartel in the rental market, is building 164 units in the Clancy Barracks site in Kilmainham.  Last year it requested and received a social housing exemption.  In other words, we are going to continue the process of ghettoisation.  There is a way to avoid this.  I am not saying we should shaft the developer-builder.  The format was wrong in the past but it can be fixed as long as the builder gets the site value for the house he or she is providing.  However, there should be a minimum provision of 10% social housing on every site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300031#GG00500","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1431522000,"counter":856,"content":"<p>The new planning and development (No. 2) Bill proposes that the planning regulator should not be given powers to force local authorities to comply with national policy.  The Minister will instead have powers to decide whether a city or county council is flouting the guidelines and force it to change its policies.  The proposal that the regulator should not be independent from the Minister is contrary to key recommendations of the Mahon tribunal in regard to ensuring autonomy from the political system.  The report recommended that some of the planning and enforcement functions should be transferred to an independent regulator who would have power to ensure that development plans proposed by planning authorities comply with national policy.  The power to direct a local authority to change its county or local development will rest with the Minister of the day, thereby demoting the regulator to an advisor.  The Bill attempts to address the dilemma of how an independent regulatory body can operate without compromising the existing democratic qualities of the planning system.  This has all the appearance of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government maintaining its stranglehold over these powers.  Without powers of enforcement, it is impossible to see how the regulator can be effective.<\/p>  <p>  An ongoing issue in County Limerick reveals an anomaly in the proposed Bill.  Councillors in County Limerick passed a resolution to refer an issue pertaining to a development in Ardagh to the Minister.

Once again, the Government sits on its hands.  What is going on?  There was a promise of an independent regulator, but the Planning Bill does not allow for the establishment of such an office.  This is totally unacceptable.  The Government seems to have not yet learned its lessons on regard to this issue.  Is this another broken promise?  The issue of conflicts of interest arises again, yet we have no independent assessments.<\/p> <p> Proper and clear planning should be a priority in any democratic state or society.  I fully support the call for the establishment of an office of planning regulator, with the appointment of a planning regulator to be made following an open, public competition conducted by an independent appointments board.  The recommendations of the new planning regulator should then be made binding on the Minister.  This is a reasonable and sensible proposal.  Above all, it sends out the right message in regard to future planning projects.  The significant public concerns that exist must be dealt with.  It is time for the Government to get off the pot and accept fair and reasonable proposals.<\/p> <p> Planning, development and the construction of houses and homes are hugely important in the context of this debate.  Recently, the CSO figures on housing and poverty in this country indicated that just over half of the country's net household wealth, 53.8%, rests in the hands of just 10% of the population.  The last four budgets have helped the better off and have helped create a more unhealthy and unequal society.  I mention these figures in the context of the need to act to create a more equal society, which should be a core principle on which we agree.  I urge all Deputies to support this excellent motion.  It is about quality planning, accountability and transparency and above all it is about the future of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300031#GG00700","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431522600,"counter":859,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and note the progress the Government has made as a result of the planning related recommendations which emanated from the Mahon report.  I also note that the Planning and Development (No. 2) Bill 2015 will provide for the establishment of the office of planning regulator.  It is no harm for us to be reminded of the sins of the fathers or those who went before us in regard to not just issues around zoning, but to issues regarding the quality and suitability of buildings in certain areas.  We have been dealing with fall-out from such planning and standards issues since.<\/p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to express the more serious concerns I have about the Planning and Development (No. 1) Bill 2014.  In many ways, the No. 2 Bill looks back to this Bill, but we should look forward and try to implement lessons we have learned from what went on in the past and from the findings of the tribunal.  I applaud two of the objectives of the Planning and Development (No. 1) Bill 2014, namely, the objective of securing additional housing units to address the current severe housing shortage, particularly in large urban centres and commuter belts, and to increase productivity and jobs in the construction sector.<\/p>  <p>  However, I have a particular concern in regard to the vacant site levy, which it is proposed will apply to towns with a population of over 3,000.  This would see local authorities having an entitlement to apply a charge on vacant or under utilised sites in towns of this size.  This proposal is made in order to address the issues of land hoarding and supply.  While detailed legislation is not available yet, the general scheme published by the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, suggests further consideration needs to be given to the issues.  Otherwise, many owners of vacant sites will be unfairly penalised.  Not all parts of the country are affected by a severe housing shortage.  Many market towns around the country, such as towns in my county like Ballina, Castlebar and Westport, have empty houses in private housing estates and even if one is on the council waiting list in these areas, private rented accommodation is available.  Therefore, the urgency or requirement for emergency measures does not exist in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, we must plan for the future, particularly for social housing.  I welcome some of the projects announced by the Minister recently, but we need more, including in my county where we have approximately 1,500 on the council housing list.  Often the owners of vacant sites in these areas are far from being property hoarders and find there is no real market for their property, whether as a would-be housing site or a commercial property.  Often it is not commercially viable for them to develop the site or make it functional and they may not even be able to get finance from a bank.  How fair is it on these property owners to be boxed in by a law that we might introduce when they have no option for development or sale of a site?  They face having a vacant site levy placed on them by a local authority.  These property owners are already subject to the Derelict Sites Act, which can force them to keep the site or building in a reasonable condition so as not to diminish unduly the amenity of surrounding property.<\/p>  <p>  I have one other bone to pick in regard to this particular legislation.  I find it highly ironic that the vacant site levy will not apply to State owned property or to property owned by councils.  Some of the biggest offenders in regard to vacant sites are the local authorities, which have vacant sites and houses that need to be developed.  Sometimes they do not have the money for this, but I am sure many property owners with vacant sites they can do nothing with would find it highly offensive if local authorities could levy them while not being compelled themselves to do up their properties.  In my county, if local authorities did up their vacant properties, this would go a long way towards a solution to providing housing for people on the housing list.<\/p>  <p>  My concern is that the vacant site levy is an attempt to address a problem, but it is not a problem that is experienced in the same way throughout the country.  We must plan for the future.  We are a growing economy and have a growing population.  Our plans are to disperse growth throughout the country, not just in the urban centres.  What is happening in Dublin and major urban centres is not happening where I am living.  I ask that the vacant site levy be reconsidered and made more nuanced and not simply applied on the basis of what the local authority will decide for areas with a population in excess of 3,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300032#HH00200","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1431522600,"counter":860,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  Before I was re-elected to the D&aacute;il in February 2011, I was a Dublin City councillor for more than 30 years.  Much of what went on in the Dublin councils in the 1980s and 1990s, which was later reported on by the Mahon tribunal, was caused by greed, corruption and unregulated lobbying that lead to unsafe planning decisions.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke in the first D&aacute;il debate on the Mahon report when it was published.  The report was of special interest to me, as the Baldoyle, Cloghran and Drumnigh Mahon report modules referred to the 1993 rezonings which took place in the Dublin North-East constituency where Judge Mahon found that corrupt payments were made to some councillors.  In March 2012, I called on the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider these findings of the Mahon tribunal.  In Chapter 9, the tribunal has found that Mr. Frank Dunlop paid six councillors, named in the Mahon Report, sums of the equivalent of &pound;1,000 each for their support for the 1993 Baldoyle lands rezoning motions.  Another councillor received a payment of &pound;1,000 from Mr. Dunlop at that time, which the councillor told the Mahon tribunal was a donation to his January 1993 Senate election campaign after he lost his D&aacute;il seat.  This was the period when the dual mandate was allowed for D&aacute;il Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  All of this greed, corruption and unregulated lobbying led to unsafe planning decisions that triggered the property bubble a decade later.  In my Dublin North-East constituency, the estates built on the rezoned Baldoyle racecourse lands were left unfinished and are only now being completed thanks to initiatives taken by the Government and Fingal County Council.<\/p><p>In nearby Donaghmede, the death trap apartment complex of Priory Hall built by cowboy builder Tom McFeely was the worst planning disaster of the Celtic tiger property boom.  The property boom unfortunately attracted cowboys like McFeely.  I do not think any of the Sinn F&eacute;in speakers in this debate have referred to the Tom McFeely and Priory Hall saga so far but I stand to be corrected on that.  I always held the view that Priory Hall should be demolished and I welcome the fact that Dublin City Council has now commenced rebuilding Priory Hall with Government funding provided to Dublin City Council.  I thought of the comparison with Priory Hall when it was reported recently that six houses in the Millfield Manor estate in Newbridge, County Kildare, were completely gutted by a fire.<br\/><br\/>Many new homes in north Dublin built during the Celtic tiger era were infected with pyrite.  Homeowners struggling with mortgage payments and negative equity did not need the pyrite problem on top of that.  This Government, through the setting up of the pyrite resolution board, put a mechanism in place to deal with this planning failure and I am glad that homes in Clongriffin in Donaghmede and the Coast estate in Baldoyle had their pyrite issues dealt with to their satisfaction.  There are still homes in Belmayne in Balgriffin where a solution to the pyrite problem has not been found.  The difficulty in Belmayne arises because of a decision by the insurance company involved not to cover the cost incurred by the home owners, who have to engage qualified professionals to prove the presence of pyrite in their homes in the first place.  The cost of this can mount up to &euro;3,000.  As I said already, the insurance company, very unfairly in my view, will not reimburse the homeowners for this additional cost for which they are painfully out of pocket.  <br\/><br\/>Many of these planning, building control and compliance failures happened because of the <i>laissez-faire<\/i>, light-touch regulation regimes that were then in place.  These have now have been reformed and strengthened by this Government and I am glad that I was part of that reform.  In June 2012 I welcomed the legislation on lobbying that was introduced at that time and I said then that this Government was keen to create more transparency over Government decision making, and to that effect was enacting legislation dealing with the issue.  For the first time the public would be able to view information on the contacts that are made between lobbyists and the Government.  This is critically important and it needs to be highlighted that these are moves to legislate on the basis of the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal report for far greater transparency over the role of lobbyists.<br\/><br\/>In the planning and development (No. 2) Bill, which is currently being drafted for consideration by this House, the core function of the new regulator will relate to the evaluation and assessment of local plans and regional strategies, including land rezonings, and will involve making recommendations to the Minister on these matters.  Where the Minister agrees with the recommendations of the regulator, the Minister will issue appropriate directions and instructions to the relevant local authority on the steps that should be taken in regard to the revision of the relevant plan or strategy. <br\/><br\/>The Mahon tribunal report focused on events in Dublin but we must not forget that there are concerns regarding planning decisions in the rest of the country.  That is why independent consultants, MacCabe Durney Barnes have been appointed on a statutory basis to conduct a review of the application of planning practices and procedures in six of the seven local authorities, Carlow, Cork, Galway and Meath County Councils as well as the Dublin councils.  The Minister intends that the review being undertaken by MacCabe Durney Barnes will take precedence over his Department's own review and he will carefully consider and implement any further recommendations that emerge from this independent review.<br\/><br\/>I regard the Mahon tribunal report as a fundamental point of departure from the inadequate standards of the past and a beginning of a new approach to planning in this country.  The Government is determined to continue to act on the findings and planning recommendations of the Mahon tribunal report and to ensure that our planning system is never again allowed to be exploited as it was in the past.  Instead, our planning system will be redesigned and operated properly to ensure that it is a properly functioning, effective, responsive, transparent and publicly accountable planning system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300032#HH00300","speaker":"1021","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431523200,"counter":862,"content":"<p>This is the first Government to have taken any real steps towards reforming our planning system so that it is fair, fit for purpose and, most importantly, serves the common good of the people.

The Mahon tribunal lasted 15 years and resulted in a 3,270-page report.  This Government is acting on its many findings and recommendations and I strongly welcome the transparent, fair and accountable approach we are taking.<\/p>  <p>  Such change cannot happen overnight and if we want real and long lasting change in our approach to planning, we must ensure we do it right this time.  As a former D&uacute;n Laoghaire county councillor, I am very aware of the many bureaucratic issues, grey areas and downright lack of fairness and transparency that can arise around planning.  We are all too familiar with the sights of depressing ghost estates, empty retail and business parks and residential zones in areas that should never have been sanctioned.  Unfortunately, many people have lost faith in the planning applications system.  This cannot continue.  Transparency and accountability are key to ensuring that no planning fiascos like ghost estates, the building of housing estates and apartment blocks on water plains or Priory Hall ever occur again.  It simply cannot be the case that a young couple encounters one bureaucratic difficulty after another in their planning application.  <\/p>  <p>  Let us not forget the real steps this Government has taken in trying to fix previous government mess-ups such as the pyrite issue and Priory Hall.

It would be a step too far.  This is why the Minister must have the ultimate decision on powers of direction and local development plans adopted by locally elected members.

The independent evaluation, published in March 2013, generally supported the Department's recommendations in its 2012 report and included some additional recommendations.<\/p> <p> Independent consultants have been appointed on a statutory basis to conduct a review of the application of the planning practices and procedures in six of the seven local authorities included in the planning review prepared in June 2012.  The consultants are at an advanced stage of finalising their independent planning review which involves consultation with each of the original complainants and all the planning authorities concerned in preparing their report.  The Minister will carefully consider and implement any further recommendations that emerge from the independent review report, which he expects to receive from the consultants by the end of June.  The Minister will issue a public statement, including any appropriate actions to be pursued regarding further policy development and guidance while also taking account of the need to develop wider proposals for improving the transparency and openness of the planning system as recommended in the report of the Mahon tribunal.  Every citizen will welcome it, given that we all want to move away from the unfortunate historic events and inadequate housing standards that have had such an impact on the country and on the lives of many families.<\/p> <p> The Minister is finalising arrangements for the imminent appointment of a senior counsel on a non-statutory basis, nominated by the Attorney General, to prepare a report on planning matters in respect of Donegal County Council.  The arrangements involved will be announced shortly.<\/p> <p> The Minister is advancing wider reform and other important planning initiatives, such as the planning and development (No. 1) Bill, aimed primarily at addressing the housing supply shortage that is particularly acute in the Dublin area and as a visible commitment on the part of the Government to the Construction 2020 strategy published in May 2014.  The main provisions of this are the revision of the Part V arrangements on social and affordable housing, the retrospective application of reduced development contribution charges, the introduction of a vacant site levy, and \"use it or lose it\" provisions on planning permissions.  Another example of this wider reform is the recent publication of the planning policy statement, which provides for a concise and clear statement on the purpose of planning, values and principles we want to underpin planning, and a vision for what the Government wants to deliver.  The Minister will initiate an organisationally focused external review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which must be seen as a significant opportunity for this much respected State body.  The Minister intends shortly to publish arrangements for the preparation of a new national planning framework to succeed the national spatial strategy, which will require considerable consultation with other Government Departments, State agencies and NGOs, as well as an appropriate level of public consultation before the submission of the final strategy to the Oireachtas.  The newly shaped regional assemblies will prepare regional spatial and economic strategies in tandem with the preparation of the national planning framework.  This is particularly necessary in our cities, where we are running out of commercially zoned land and need new areas in which to build businesses.<\/p> <p> All these important initiatives demonstrate that the Government and the Minister are engaged across an unprecedented array of legislative, policy development and organisational reforms designed to return our planning system to its roots as a process fundamentally focused on the common good, in which people can be confident and on which people can depend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300033#JJ00300","speaker":"988","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431523800,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  It is often forgotten that the first victims of bad planning are people.  Planning and all of the regulations and laws involved with it is a very important issue.  During my 19 years on Longford County Council, I have seen countless examples of bad planning in my native county and throughout the wider midlands region.  During the past two decades, the planning system has fallen victim to systematic corruption, a lack of transparency and the vested interests of developers.  The loopholes in Ireland's planning laws ensured a complete lack of proper regulation.  The repercussions of bad planning have had an appalling impact on the lives of people in every corner of the country.  The number of people affected by bad planning is almost too high to count.  Bad planning has resulted in development on flood plains, unnecessary over-zoning of lands by county councils and a blatant failure to protect water resources properly.<\/p>  <p>  The Gleann Riada development in Ballyminion, County Longford is an example of building on a flood plain.  The granting of planning in early 2004 was a surprise.  The Ballyminion area was well known to flood and was better known for duck shooting than housing.  Despite this, planning permission was granted for several hundred homes, a hotel, petrol station and retail units.  Only 70 units were completed, the majority of which have since been demolished.  Another example of terrible planning was the Carrigglas development just outside Longford town.  The development had been in receivership until it was recently sold, and I wish the very best of good luck to the new owner.  It sits on 600 acres of land with a proposal at the time to build 330 new homes.  Once again, only a small percentage of these homes were built and the local community is left with the remains of a half-built ghost estate which was never lived in and which will remain unsuitable for agricultural use without a substantial investment.  In 2013, Athlone saw the demolition of the unfinished Glenatore estate following a fatal tragedy.<\/p>  <p>  All these mistakes have had a major impact on families and local communities and have resulted in a total lack of trust between the public and the planning process.  I spoke on the issue of planning in this House during my first few years as a Deputy.  Back then, I said that a casual attitude to planning, on a build now and think later basis, would be a recipe for disaster.  I was right.  Thankfully, now that the Mahon report has been published, we have an opportunity to rectify the wrongs, restore public confidence in the planning process and ensure we have a fully accountable system.<\/p>  <p>  The Mahon report highlights the need for a planning system that has zero room for corrupt practices that could undermine the checks and balances that are now in place.  One of the most important recommendations in the report relates to the appointment of a planning regulator.  The core function of the new regulator will relate to the evaluation and assessment of local plans and regional strategies.  If the Minister of the day agrees with a recommendation put forward by the regulator, the regulator can issue instructions to the relevant local authority on the steps that should be taken regarding the revision of its planning strategy.  Equally important, if the Minister disagrees with the regulator's recommendation, the Minister must lay the reasons before the Houses of the Oireachtas and place them on the Department's website, which will ensure greater transparency and trust.<\/p>  <p>  I am very pleased to see that the Minister is advancing much wider reforms down the line on a range of planning initiatives.  For example, the main provisions of the planning and development (No. 1) Bill will include the revision of the Part V arrangements on social and affordable housing, retrospective application of reduced development contribution charges and the introduction of a vacant site levy.  These important strategies highlight the Government's commitment to policy development and organisational reforms regarding planning.  It is hoped that these reforms and improvements will return our planning system to what it should have always been, namely, a system focused on the interests of sustainable communities under which people can, once again, have faith and trust in the planning process and the stakeholders involved.  The Mahon report will do much for planning and out of much bad will come much good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300034#KK00200","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1431524400,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Adams who is sharing time with Deputies Ferris, Pearse Doherty, &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Crowe.

It is part and parcel of a culture of golden circles and insiders which has so tarnished the political system here and so badly served our citizens.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, which between them have wielded power in this State for the past 90 years, created, maintained and are completely mired in this corrupt political culture.  In my view, it is a consequence of the counter-revolutionary period which followed the 1916 Rising.  This is the same political culture which ultimately resulted in the total collapse of the economy seven years ago.<\/p>  <p>  The physical and social impact of corrupt planning decisions is evident to this day, especially in parts of Dublin.  Working class communities were scattered to far-flung and vast housing estates on the outskirts of Dublin and other cities, estates bereft of adequate infrastructure or amenities.  It is to the credit of the people living in these areas that they have come through what can only be described as an exercise in corrupt and mindless social engineering.<\/p>  <p>  Is tr&iacute;d a bheith eagraithe le ch&eacute;ile agus a gcearta a bheith &aacute; &eacute;ileamh acu a th&aacute;inig na pobail seo sl&aacute;n.  With the help of some political activists and a few courageous journalists, they exposed the rotten heart of planning corruption in this State.  The legacy, however, remains as a dreadful scar on this city and county.  The lengthy Mahon tribunal unveiled the reality of a decade of planning corruption.  The extent and scale of corruption which was exposed was immense.  The Mahon tribunal report was clear.  Endemic corruption was rife across the political spectrum.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael and Labour cannot portray planning corruption as solely a Fianna F&aacute;il problem.  Indeed, Fine Gael councillors and Deputies were central to planning corruption in Dublin.  Mahon highlighted an unhealthy relationship between Fine Gael Ministers and individuals involved in property development.<\/p>  <p>  The Mahon tribunal looked at matters relating to planning permission and land rezoning issues in the 1990s in the Dublin County Council area.  Nobody seriously suggests, however, that planning corruption was an issue confined to Dublin.  In 2012, Mahon made ten recommendations relating to planning.  However, 18 years after the Mahon tribunal commenced, three years after it made its final report and four years after Fine Gael and Labour assumed office, the Government has still not implemented the tribunal&rsquo;s recommendations.  Constantly pointing to Fianna F&aacute;il on planning corruption, as this Government does, has no credibility when the Government itself does nothing to root it out.<\/p>  <p>  Instead, the former Fine Gael Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, infamously frustrated proper scrutiny of the planning process.  In one of his first acts as Minister, Phil Hogan, since promoted by the Taoiseach to the prestigious position of European Commissioner, shut down an inquiry initiated by his ministerial predecessor John Gormley.  This was an inquiry into alleged planning irregularities in several local authority areas, namely Dublin city, Cork city and counties Cork, Carlow, Meath, Galway and Donegal.  Phil Hogan has never given a satisfactory explanation for doing this.  There remain serious and unanswered questions around this decision.  He actually said at one point that the allegations were spurious.  How does he know they were spurious when they have not been investigated?<\/p>  <p>  This action highlights the arrogance of this Government and its indifference to pursuing any genuine reform of the planning system.  There is a deep suspicion that Phil Hogan was motivated by a desire not to rock the boat in local government because, at the time, Fine Gael and the Labour Party controlled many councils across the State, including some in which these irregularities allegedly occurred.  His actions ran entirely contrary to the findings and recommendations of Mahon.  Does anyone believe, after four years of not implementing Mahon&rsquo;s recommendations, that this is the action of a Government serious about political reform?<\/p>  <p>  An internal review by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which was presented as an alternative to the Gormley review, claimed there was no evidence of wrongdoing in planning.  However, Gerard Convie, a senior planner in Donegal County Council, provided evidence of planning irregularities and he went to the High Court.  The court quashed the review's section on Donegal.  The Department was forced to apologise to Gerard Convie.  The internal review was discredited and had to be set aside.<\/p>  <p>  Did the Government go back to the Mahon tribunal recommendations?  No.  Instead, it set up another review into six local authorities, this time to be carried out by a group of consultants.  We have yet to see what that will come up with.  Meanwhile, Gerard Convie has presented substantial grounds for a full independent inquiry to establish whether there were any improprieties that would be subject to legal investigation.  Sinn F&eacute;in has previously called on the Government to establish such an inquiry.  I repeat that call here this evening.<\/p>  <p>  Phil Hogan was also made aware of very serious allegations regarding planning irregularities in County Wicklow.  The current Minister is aware of these allegations but nothing has been done to act on them to date.  The allegations include one in which the value of a property ear-marked for development was vastly increased in value through rezoning and compulsory purchase orders were used to facilitate the development.  It is also claimed well-known property developers, Se&aacute;n Dunne and Sean Mulryan, two of the richest men in this State prior to the financial, property and banking collapse, were to be the chief beneficiaries of all of this.  This was at a time when both of these men were struggling with massive debts accumulated through their gambling with Anglo Irish Bank and other financial institutions.  There was also an allegation that on 2 September 2014, a file relating to allegations of corruption in planning in Wicklow, which was handed into the offices of the Minister's predecessor by a former member of Wicklow County Council, was removed from the Minister's office.  The seriousness of this last allegation surely underlines the need for a full inquiry into all matters related to the alleged Wicklow irregularities.<\/p>  <p>  Central to the Mahon tribunal recommendations was the establishment of an independent planning regulator.  When the report was published in March 2012, the then Minister for State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, promised the Government would make such an appointment.  It still has not happened.  Three years later, Fine Gael and Labour are still sitting on their hands.  The Government has published an outline for proposals on planning which does not provide for an office of a regulator, independent of the Minister.  The Government's proposed scheme falls far short of what is required and what was recommended in the Mahon tribunal report.  Why?  The Government's outline would make any such office subservient to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I would like to think that we want to decouple politicians from responsibilities for these matters.  This completely contradicts the Mahon tribunal's recommendation for a regulator with powers separate from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p>  <p>  If the Government genuinely seeks to break with the corrupt political legacy of the past it must move to reform the planning process.  The Government's amendment shows it has no intention of doing this.  The Government&rsquo;s proposal, as it stands, is highly unlikely to be presented as legislation before its term ends.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes real reform of the planning process with responsible, ethical and sustainable planning, underpinned by equality.  This is the right of all who live in this State.  An independent planning regulator would operate in the same manner as the Office of the Ombudsman.  A stand-alone Bill to establish such an office could be published before the summer recess.  larraim ar achan Teachta tac&uacute; le tairiscint Shinn F&eacute;in anocht.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300035#LL00200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1431525000,"counter":868,"content":"<p>When one talks to real people, not the people who inhabit this institution but real people on the streets of the villages and towns of Ireland, they are well versed in the level of corruption, greed and cronyism that exists in this State.<\/p>  <p>  Most of the cases which came to light during the Mahon tribunal were in and around Dublin, but we are all well aware of planning decisions in our own constituencies which did not make sense.  Those decisions left some councillors scratching their heads, wondering why and on what basis decisions were reached.  Some of the planning decisions taken in this State in questionable circumstances had terrible consequences for people who in good faith went out and got mortgages to buy houses, which ended up being built on flood plains or other unsuitable sites, and who have suffered for that ever since.  Planning conditions were not met in cases where people ended up living in housing estates which did not have the infrastructure to provide decent lives for those inhabiting them.  It was more of the self-regulation that the economic elite seem to be able to get away with in all sorts of ways.<\/p>  <p>  Last night, Deputies Calleary and O'Donovan referred to the Minister's role in regard to local development plans.  Apart from the fact that Deputy Calleary&rsquo;s own party passed the relevant legislation, I do agree with him regarding the fact that democratically agreed development plans can be set aside by the Minister.  We saw that recently where objections from Westmeath and Laois county councils to the plans for massive wind farms were basically overridden by the Government as part of its now abandoned plan to allow the building of vast industrial scale wind farms across the midlands to generate electricity for export.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in drafted a Wind Turbines Bill last year, which was not opposed by the Government, although there has been no attempt to bring it forward since.  Our Bill proposed that county development plans could not be overruled by the provisions of the Strategic Infrastructure Act which allows the State to push through projects if it deems them to be of sufficient economic importance.  As things stand, the Minister can simply ignore, as was done in Westmeath and Laois, the concerns of democratically elected local representatives who are voicing the concerns of the people who elected them.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was also made to new building regulations that came into force last year.  These have acted as a huge disincentive to people who wish to build houses on their own land.  That, in turn, has had a negative impact on local construction companies and builders' suppliers.<\/p>  <p>  There need to be proper procedures and scrutiny through the planning process, but that should be done through the local authority rather than a person having to engage the services of a third party who will charge them a large amount of money to sign off on their plans and reports.  In some cases, I have heard that it can cost up to &euro;25,000 before any start has been made on a house.  That is not unusual.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important that if the Government&rsquo;s plans to boost the construction sector take off, rural communities are not again subjected to the type of abuse which took place at the height of the last property bubble.  We do not want to end up with more ghost estates and more houses built on flood plains.  All that can be prevented through proper planning procedures.  I agree that most of that can be done through existing structures once they are open and transparent.  I also believe, however, that an independent planning regulator would act as a guarantor that everything is above board and can be reviewed in the event of concerns being expressed about particular proposals.<\/p>  <p>  When the former Green Party leader, John Gormley, was Minister for the Environment and Local Government, he set about investigating planning irregularities in Dublin, Cork, Meath, Galway and Carlow.  This Government promised to implement an independent assessment but then along came Big Phil Hogan as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The next thing we knew was that there would be no independent assessment and the investigations were stopped in their tracks.  The outcome of the Mahon tribunal was to recommend such an investigation.  It acknowledged the need to address public concerns about planning procedures, as well as the need to establish independent oversight procedures recommended by the report of the tribunal.  Even though Phil Hogan - \"Mr. Don&rsquo;t-Investigate-Planning-Irregularities\", who was responsible for Irish Water, septic tank charges and the property tax &ndash; has gone on to an even more lucrative job, his legacy remains on the Government benches.  That is why we have brought forward this motion so that conflicts of interest and other legacy issues regarding planning can be investigated independently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300036#MM00100","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1431525000,"counter":869,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an r&uacute;n at&aacute; curtha s&iacute;os ag &aacute;r bp&aacute;irt&iacute; anocht le pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an cheist seo agus, go h&aacute;irithe, d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis an Teachta Stanley.

While Gormley's review was clearly prompted by serious concerns about planning irregularities, which was amply proven in the Mahon tribunal in the case of Dublin City Council, this was abandoned by the current Minister's immediate predecessor, Phil Hogan.  At the time, Mr. Hogan said that such an inquiry would be inappropriate.  He then established an internal departmental review which, when it reported in March 2013, was considered to have been so inadequate that consultants MacCabe Durney Barnes were subsequently engaged to conduct a statutory review of the planning procedures of six of the seven counties which the Gormley inquiry had targeted.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, states that he hopes to receive this report next month.  We all look forward to that report, but what happened to the seventh county of Donegal?  Although originally targeted by the Gormley review, Donegal is not subject to the current one.  Instead, the Minister said last night that he is finalising arrangements for the imminent appointment of a senior counsel, on a non-statutory basis, nominated by the Attorney General, to prepare a report on planning matters in respect of Donegal County Council.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister knows, as I do, that there are serious allegations regarding Donegal.  They have been made by the former county planner, Gerard Convie.  His claims of irregularities were dismissed by the former Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, although he was subsequently vindicated in the courts.  I hope therefore that the investigation he referred to will be in operation as soon as possible.  I am aware that there are legal aspects to this, so I will not go into any further detail, other than to say that Mr. Convie and all those involved in the Donegal planning office must be able to have full disclosure of the issues involved.  If, by any chance, there are irregularities present, they need to be disclosed to the public.<\/p>  <p>  All of this highlights that it is insufficient to have internal reviews and consultancy reports.  We need an independent planning regulator with teeth.  It does not need to be a vast, costly operation but it does need teeth and to be genuinely at arm's length from the Minister.  It should also be empowered to make recommendations, if necessary, to ensure that proven cases of corruption are brought to the attention of the legal authorities.  Otherwise we are doomed to repeat the failures of the past.<\/p>  <p>  This is all about political priorities.  In 2013, the Cabinet approved the establishment of an independent regulator, but the Government has done nothing about it.  Yet in that period, the Government had no problem introducing Irish Water and subsequent legislation to bill nearly 2 million customers.<\/p><p>It is about priorities and this Government must get its priorities right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300036#MM00200","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431525600,"counter":871,"content":"<p>Let me first take us back to the Mahon tribunal, first established in 1994.  For some current registered voters, that is more than a lifetime ago.  This was among the most renowned and most drawn-out in our history of drawn-out tribunals.  Looking at matters relating to planning and land rezoning issues in the 1990s in the Dublin County Council area, it examined conflicts of interest, political finance, lobbying, bribery, corruption, money laundering and misuse of confidential information.  A veritable treasure trove of corruption was reported on in its publication in 2012.  What came of the report?  There were ten recommendations relating to planning, including the following as yet unimplemented points that appear to be gathering dust somewhere.  These are notice in case of material contravention of development plans; documentation of interventions by elected members; the requirement to identify political donation when making a planning application; and a transferring of the Minister's enforcement powers to an independent planning regulator.  None of these has been progressed, let alone implemented.<\/p>  <p>  I add my voice to all in my party and across the State calling on the Government to appoint an independent regulator to oversee planning procedures.  The Mahon tribunal report was published in March 2012.  Why has Fine Gael failed to ensure an independent planning regulator over the period since?  We should remember that this is despite Fine Gael's protestations that it represents a different kind of politics to the long-toxic Fianna F&aacute;il.  The party appears to be not so different now.  While we saw the housing market and development slow down during the recession, there have been some predictions that the demand for houses will increase.  We are all well aware of the pressure for housing of all shapes and sizes in Dublin and in our larger urban areas.  The Housing Agency reported recently that a total of 79,660 housing units will be required across all urban areas up to 2018, 47% of which will be required across the city of Dublin.  The Government must act at once to ensure that robust, fair and transparent planning laws are in place so we can provide housing for all citizens without having recourse to the nod and wink culture that so badly served us in our recent history.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has previously committed to providing such a body.  However, it had not shown in the proposed scheme for the planning and development (No. 2) Bill any way to do this.  The Government has, in time-honoured fashion, tabled an amendment to this motion that welcomes the progress by the Government to date on this issue.  It would do so, as that is what it does.  I am happy to welcome the commitment to the establishment of the office of the planning regulator but this needs to happen urgently.  We are also very concerned that the Government's proposals would have a so called independent planning regulator that would be subservient to the Minister.  Unfortunately, Ireland of the wink and the nod remains and the true damage of this culture will remain with us for many years to come.  As a small island nation, we know that many in various fields, like planning and politics, will have connections or they might even be related.  This is exactly why we need an independent body.  We need to ensure that conflicts of interest are no longer tolerated.  We need to be assured of a fearless independent body to take on any vested interests and ensure that all legacy issues are fully investigated.<\/p>  <p>  In 2011, the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, and this Government decided not to press on with the promised reviews into planning in local authorities in Dublin city, Cork city, Cork county, Carlow, Meath and Galway as planned under the previous Government by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  How can we have confidence in such a government, in this Government?  A planning regulator must be appointed following an open public competition by an independent appointments board.  This is the best way to ensure full independence.  The recommendations of the planning regulator must be made binding on the Minister of the day.  I also ask the Government to address the serious allegations already referred to regarding planning irregularities in County Wicklow as a priority.<\/p>  <p>  Bh&iacute; amhras m&oacute;r ar go leor maidir le plean&aacute;il in &Eacute;irinn le fada.

It is regrettable that despite a Government commitment to appoint an independent planning regulator, the Government's proposed scheme for a new planning Bill does not allow for the establishment of such an office.  They question is why that is so.  The planning Bill that the Government now proposes to introduce will establish an office that is subject to the overall rule and veto of a Minister.  The Government's amendment to our motion states that it is in a process of creating an independent regulator's office but the problem is that the proposed new planning Bill does not allow for the appointment of an independent regulator.  The Irish Planning Institute has stated that with the Government's Bill the final say in planning matters will still reside in the office of the Minister responsible for the environment, not with the new regulator's office.  The new regulator instead will act as an adviser to the Minister.  Our proposal for an independent regulator answerable to the Oireachtas and appointed by an independent appointments board is clearly necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The Mahon tribunal that has been mentioned, which investigated planning regulation decisions in Dublin, detailed a large web of corruption throughout the 1980s and 1990s.  According to some, it cost the taxpayer &euro;250 million with a former Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell, saying it would cost &euro;1 billion.  The Revenue Commissioners recovered up to &euro;100 million of that money in undeclared taxes and so on.  Three people were imprisoned, including one for corrupt practices and bribing politicians.  Another was imprisoned for contempt of court.  As we know, one of the modules examined the behaviour of a former Taoiseach.  As has been mentioned, one third of Dublin City Council members were implicated as corrupt in the tribunal with respect to land rezoning and development issues.<\/p>  <p>  We also know the tribunal was obstructed at every turn - there were approximately 400 court applications by developers and other individuals - and we can see that its recommendations are not being enforced.  The last Government fell because of the perception of the electorate that there was an unhealthy relationship between politicians, wealthy businessmen, speculators and developers.  The Mahon tribunal was described tonight by some Government speakers as a new departure but the promised new approach has not happened.  The golden circle link between bankers, developers and politicians is still alive and well.  The view has been peddled that corruption happens all over the world but it did not happen in Ireland.  We know that is nonsense.<\/p>  <p>  By not supporting this motion, the Government is refusing to abide by a key recommendation of Mr. Justice Mahon on creating an office for an independent regulator.  The structure that the Government wants to create is clearly not as Mr. Justice Mahon intended, which would have brought about an independent entity with the power to make binding recommendations.  We have seen much corruption in land planning in this country, specifically centred on the acquisition of lands and rezonings.  Corrupt dealings on land regulations between politicians and developers brought them tens of millions of euro in benefits at the expense of the taxpayer and public services.  It is clear that we need to properly investigate the significant legacy issues regarding planning.  Additionally, we need to establish an independent planning regulator, with similar powers to the Ombudsman.  It is regrettable that the Government is not acting to support increased accountability and transparency in planning matters in supporting this motion.<\/p><p>It will also be interesting to see how the electorate responds to those politicians who were seen as corrupt and who took corrupt payments if they stand in the next election.  Hopefully, they will get the response they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300037#NN00300","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431526200,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I am happy to offer concluding remarks on behalf of the Government.  The debate over last night and tonight on this Private Member's motion confirms the universal consensus emerging from all sides of this House to broadly acknowledge the mistakes of the past as exposed through the tribunal report and accept that such mistakes must never again be allowed to be witnessed in our planning process.  This debate has provided both the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and me with the opportunity to dispel any doubts there may be in the minds of the Opposition on the Government's commitment to good planning and also to demonstrate the extensive array of legislative and policy development work we are advancing to ensure that the inadequate standards in the past are consigned to history.  Current and future planning will be community centred rather than developer led; place-making rather than development centred, and wise about the use of scarce resources, whether economic, environmental or social.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has spoken about the establishment of the independent office of the planning regulator.  The regulator will represent a significant new development in the already extensive institutional landscape that oversees public bodies including local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The regulator will oversee the functioning of an effective, responsive, visionary, transparent and publicly accountable planning system that is not only a fundamental requirement but a prerequisite for a modern successful economy like Ireland's.  A constant theme in the contributions last night related to the expressed view of Deputies of the need for an independent and accountable planning regulator.  We heard that again here this evening.  In this regard and in framing the Government's response, I have had to be very mindful of the need to carefully integrate the role of the regulator into the existing roles of other regulatory bodies including SIPO, the Office of the Ombudsman, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my role as Minister of State.  Indeed, I would suspect that I would be even more sharply criticised by Opposition Deputies if I were to create overlap or confusion by randomly adding another public body to an already crowded institutional landscape or, more critically, if I were to hand effective overall control of the policy making aspects of the planning process to unelected officials with no democratic mandate or duty to defend difficult decisions at local and community levels.<\/p>  <p>  I am at a loss to understand how Opposition Deputies are claiming that the regulator will not be independent.  It is a fact that the office of the planning regulator will be fully independent of the Minister in carrying out its functions.  The regulator will, subject to the passage of the legislation by the Oireachtas, be a fully-fledged regulator who can initiate organisational reviews and monitor the performance of planning authorities and do so independently.  The regulator will not have to wait for the instruction of the Minister of the day.  As Minister of State, I am determined to ensure that the office of the planning regulator will be the independent guardian of the overall capacity for beneficial change and operational effectiveness of our planning system.  The regulator will take on a very specific role, independently of the Minister, through its oversight of the planning functions of planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p>  <p>  There has been recognition by some Opposition Deputies in this debate of the critical need for democratic accountability for the office of the planning regulator.  This recognition is underpinned by the significantly important and well-established reserved function of our locally elected members who are empowered to guide the preparation and adoption of local development plans in the interest of their local communities while also ensuring consistency with proper planning and sustainable development locally, regionally and nationally.  Thereafter, when these local level development plans are assessed by an independent planning regulator, it will be done entirely independent of the Minister taking proper account of the policy and legislative planning framework put in place by the Minister.  As a prescribed body, the regulator will be engaging directly with the local planning authorities on the evolution of these plans from their initiation through publication at draft and amended draft stage without any intervention by the Minister.  It is only where the regulator considers a planning authority is not complying with its assessment and relevant strategic or national level considerations that it will request the direct intervention of the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and, I suspect, many Opposition Deputies are of the view that if the decision of democratically elected local councillors are to be overturned, the person responsible for that power should also be democratically accountable.  Otherwise, we would be consigning effective control of all development plan policy matters in one sweep to an unelected official with no democratic mandate whatsoever.  The Minister and I will also ensure that the office of the planning regulator can and will conduct independent reviews of planning authorities from time to time as it deems necessary or as may be requested by ourselves as Ministers for the purposes of review of the relevant organisation's systems and procedures in relation to the performance of its functions under the planning Acts.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I note that the Government is determined to face up to the errors of its predecessors by driving forward positive reform of the planning system because we believe in planning as a way to achieve prosperity, equality and sustainability for our citizens.  The Minister and I look forward to working with the House in the coming months on delivering an efficient, more effective, fit for purpose, well-functioning and fair planning system that learns from the mistakes of the past and provides the foundation for the future progress and prosperity of our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300038#OO00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1431526200,"counter":875,"content":"<p>Talk of Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il coalition is nonsense.  There is no need for such a coalition when Fine Gael and Labour become day by day more Fianna F&aacute;il than Fianna F&aacute;il itself.  Despite the lofty rhetoric of reform, the depressing truth is that it is business as usual.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le mo chomp&aacute;naigh as ucht an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo a chur os &aacute;r gcomhair.<\/p>  <p>  It seems from the outset of taking up office that neither Fine Gael or the Labour Party had any real intention of changing the existing political culture in the State.  In 2012, Labour and Fine Gael Ministers lined up to peddle the lie that the former Minister for the Environment, John Gormley, had not lifted a finger to progress independent inquiries into planning in a number of local authorities.  The truth is that the former Green Party Minister had left Phil Hogan an extensive dossier which was prepared by planning officials in the Department following an internal review of complaints, a series of reports from the managers in each of the local authorities, terms of reference for a panel of planning consultants to carry out independent reviews of six local authorities, including my own in County Meath, and a completed tender process to select that panel of consultants.  Letters of appointment were ready to be issued to members of the panel.  A great deal of work was done on this issue right up to the drafting of letters of appointment of a panel to carry out the work.  Fast forward three years and we have yet to see this important work carried out and are listening to the same nonsense.<\/p>  <p>  Last night, the Minister claimed the Government had ensured substantial compliance with the recommendations of the Mahon report, but this is simply not true.  The general scheme for the proposed planning legislation is just that, a scheme.  In the unlikely event that the legislation is introduced before the election, it will only deal with one of the Mahon report's recommendations.  Even the planning regulator proposal is a watered-down version of what it should have been.  He or she will be appointed by the Minister who, in turn, will be under no obligation to pay a blind bit of notice to the office.  The Mahon report recommended the establishment of an independent regulator but the Government has set its face against that for its own particular reasons.  Of the ten recommendations in the report, the Government did not accept that members of the National Transport Authority be appointed by an independent appointments board.  The Government claims other recommendations are being considered or, in the case of the regulator, being legislated for, but to most observers it does not appear that its proposal complies with the recommendation for an independent regulator.  Indeed, the three recommendations that have been implemented - making statutory provision for the national spatial plan, increasing transparency and documenting regional planning guidelines - were implemented before the tribunal reported and cannot, therefore, be claimed by the Government as a response to the Mahon report.  The fact that such a costly and lengthy tribunal has not been fully complied with regarding its recommendations flies in the face of the Government's promise to act swiftly and decisively to clean up the planning process.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that improvements have been made with regard to the worst aspects of the rottenness and cancer at the heart of the process years ago as described by Mahon.<\/p><p>However, there still seems to me to be a relationship between big money and influence in this State.  Some might claim that there is a continued influence of one of the star turns of Moriarty.  The only certain way to ensure the necessary vigilance is in place and to ensure we do not return to the days of brown envelopes being passed in bars to local councillors and planners is to establish a fully independent planning regulator.  If we do not have that type of enforcement, we cannot be guaranteed that these issues, which have disastrous effects on all of society, will be resolved.<\/p> <p> The question is whether this Government will get involved in fully independent anything.  We see, right across the process, that the Government seems to want investigations to be carried out by organisations that are not fully independent.  I urge the Minister of State to make the necessary change and ensure we have full independence.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300038#OO00300","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431526800,"counter":877,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Stanley, who has nine minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300039#PP00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1431526800,"counter":878,"content":"<p>I thought it was ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300039#PP00300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1431526800,"counter":879,"content":"<p>Some of that time would be extra but we will not fight over a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300039#PP00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1431526800,"counter":880,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  The debate over the past two evenings has been interesting.  Yesterday evening, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government referred to the Mahon tribunal and said the situation regarding planning has radically changed.  He also claimed that the scheme for the new planning Bill will implement the conclusions and recommendations of the Mahon report.  There is a number of issues I wish to raise in reply to those statements.<\/p><p>We all recognise that the Mahon tribunal did excellent work in revealing corruption in planning, mainly in the Dublin area, over a certain period.  The final cost was massive.  It was reported to the Committee of Public Accounts that it cost &euro;103 million.  It is therefore only right that the ten recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, as set out at the end of its report, are implemented in full.  It is important that we implement them.  I am not satisfied that this will be the case, given what we have seen of the Government's proposal, as outlined in the general scheme for the planning (No. 2) Bill.<\/p><p>I do not want to go over the ground touched on last night but, suffice to say, neither our party, Sinn F&eacute;in, nor the Irish Planning Institute, which is of the same mind, are satisfied that the office of planning regulator as proposed in the scheme will be as recommended by the Mahon tribunal, especially when it comes to the regulator's independence of the Minister.  I am also not satisfied that the planning process is transformed since the time of the Mahon report, as stated by the Minister.  It is true that there is not the same level of corruption, but neither is there the same level of construction.<\/p><p>There have been improvements since the time of the rampant construction which occurred when there was an unhealthy relationship between politicians, officials and the developers we had in the past.  However, controversy surrounds some recent planning decisions, which reflects badly on the overall process.  In particular, I am thinking of the Corrib gas pipeline project and the midlands' wind farm proposals.  In both cases, there was widespread opposition and objections on various grounds.  There have been objections to wind farms from at least two local authorities but my local authority in Laois and the one in Westmeath were basically ignored.<\/p><p>We also have legacy issues in Wicklow and other counties, which were referred to yesterday evening.  These need an inquiry, but I believe such an inquiry would only have credibility if conducted by an office of an independent planning regulator.  We must never again have a situation in which developers and their financial backers have the huge influence that they once had over local development plans, rezoning and planning matters.  Much of what was built throughout the noughties was an absolute scandal.<\/p><p>One example is the Riverside estate in Portarlington which was built during that period.  It was built with little or no drainage.  It had an awful design, a terrible layout, awful planning, terrible standards of building and the materials used were substandard.  The walls are like sponges.  They soak up rain.  The rain soaks in through the rendering and there is sponge-like material in the middle.  Having purchased at the height of the boom, paid premium prices and despite having mortgages over them, residents have had to abandon their homes.  The big apartment blocks in that development are now deserted.  The local authority that gave the planning permission, Offaly County Council, did not enforce fully the conditions of planning permission or the minimalist building regulations.<\/p><p>I also wish to refer to the issue of Tymon and the likely conclusion of the Minister's planning initiatives.  It was said here yesterday that we would be lucky to see the Bill framed before the end of the year, which is what we were promised by the Minister last night.  However, given the normal length of time associated with the drafting process, this is optimistic.  Even if we accept the stated timeframe, does the Minister of State not agree that, given it is at its final furlong, the Government has left it very late to legislate for and implement the recommendations in the Mahon report.  Further, only three of the ten recommendations in the Mahon report are being implemented, which is not at all good.<\/p><p>The Minister also referred to the other planning Bill, or scheme as it currently is, last night.  This deals with construction, housing issues and Part V, and I imagine it will have and is being given priority over the planning regulator Bill.<\/p><p>If the Mahon recommendations, in particular the recommendation on an independent regulator, are not legislated for and expanded prior to a geared up phase of construction, the danger exists that we will run back into the same problems we had in the past.  The Minister correctly stated that planning corruption is not a faceless or victimless crime but one that impacts on communities up and down the country.  We agree with that statement.  However, claiming that the planning process is radically improved since the time of the Mahon tribunal is all very well and good, but it must be ensured through action measures and we must have that action.  The key recommendations must be implemented.<\/p><p>The Minister also referred to what he called the organisational review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  What stage is that at and when will it be completed?  I do not share the view held by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has peerless standards of fairness, probity and transparency.  I do not share that same level of faith in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have raised the issue of conflicts of interest of some members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la with the Minister and his predecessor. <i><\/i>It is simply not good enough that people who have been involved in framing and backing controversial proposals such as the Dublin waste incinerator can cross over to the other side, as has happened, and approve, as members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the same measures and plans, even though they had been involved with RPS Consultants.<\/p><p>Similar issues have arisen in relation to wind farms.  The Minister, as part of the review of the workings of the planning board, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, could make it a rule that former employees of consultants involved in projects, in particular controversial projects, would in the future not be in a position to decide on the planning applications of those same projects.<\/p><p>I want to note as well the Minister's reference to the issue in Wicklow, which was referred to last night.  These are very serious issues.  A file on the issue in Wicklow and, in particular, the Greystones case, has gone missing from the Minister of State's office.  What I want to know and what I was not told by the Minister in his summing up is whether the Garda has been contacted about the matter.  If it has, what was the outcome?  We do not know but I would like to know.  What we do know is that the acquisition of between six and seven acres of prime land zoned for housing was dealt with in an agreement by the two Se&aacute;nies-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300039#PP00500","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1431526800,"counter":881,"content":"<p>Deputy Stanley must be careful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051300039#PP00600","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1431526800,"counter":882,"content":"<p>----- and they acquired that land for a tenner.  That is one of the most extraordinary land deals that has ever happened in the State.  It is the most extraordinary one that I have ever seen and I have studied it very carefully.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said last night that he is considering the matter.  This and other serious matters in Wicklow require more than the consideration of the Minister.  They need to be investigated by an independent planning regulator and that is why we need the independent office.  The Minister of State made reference to the fact that he does not want to create different agencies and offices.  Neither do we, but if the Government is going to create an office, it might as well be independent.  It is still just the one office.  It does not need to have 100 people in it, but it does need to be independent.<\/p><p>If the Government is going to create the office, it should give it powers.<\/p> <p> A Deputy referred to Priory Hall and its building standards.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been 100% clear on this matter.  Among the first elected representatives to take up the issue were local Sinn F&eacute;in representatives.  What happened at Priory Hall was a scandal and should never be allowed to recur.  Those who had any role in it, be it the developer or anyone else, should be held to account.  They were described as cowboys, but I would go further and describe them as buachaill&iacute; b&oacute;.
