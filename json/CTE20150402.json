This was a waste of jury time and the bill for the State's legal representatives will be approximately &euro;5 million.  It would seem the normal practice is that matters in relation to the Statute of Limitations are dealt with before the trail starts or at the very beginning of the trial.  The Courts Service and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor have to answer why so much time and taxpayer's money was spent on this case.

I will deal with what we achieved in two areas, Irish development aid and the trade opportunity that Vietnam presents.<\/p> <p>  The people would be proud of the work of the ambassador, H.E. Mr. Damien Cole, and his staff.  It is important we publicise the work they do and what they have achieved.  Irish aid has been spent in areas that provides relief not only in the medium term but also in the long term.  We visited schools and health care facilities and saw the road infrastructure that was built by Irish taxpayers' money.  This is playing a significant role in humanitarian terms.<\/p> <p>  From the perspective of opportunities in trade, and Deputy Deasy will speak in more detail on this, when we think of south-east Asia, we think of China, which is a major market, but Vietnam has a population of 91 million in a region of 600 million people and it has a growing middle class.  The growing economy represents great opportunities, particularly from a food perspective.  What came across to us is the need for more State agency personnel on the ground to promote trade, especially in agricultural products.  The market is very competitive but there is significant potential for trade.  If one thing is to come from our report, it is the need for the relevant bodies in Ireland to work with the bodies in Vietnam to ensure they are properly staffed and resourced in what is a very tough global market economy.  With the proper investment in manpower on the ground, we would have a much better opportunity of trading into these countries.<\/p> <p>  I thank the officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and all those who participated on the trip.  We had a very full programme over a number of days.  From the taxpayer's perspective, we can be proud of the way Irish aid is being spent.  As with all aid programmes, it must be kept under constant review as the country is beginning to thrive, but there is massive social poverty and deprivation.<\/p> <p>  There are opportunities to trade and we should concentrate on dairy products.  We should ensure we reap the rewards of the product we sell to them.  During our visit we met the Vietnamese Minister for planning and investment and Deputy Deasy raised with him that Ireland is open for business and that we would like to do business with them.  It was a very worthwhile trip and taxpayers can be reassured that money is spent prudently. The aid programme must be kept under constant review and there are significant opportunities for us there.<\/p> <p>  I apologise that I must leave the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015040200002#B01500","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I will develop the trade element.  The three of us have an interest in agriculture, particularly the export of dairy products.  The current value of Irish dairy exports is &euro;1.6 billion, but the market for liquid milk and milk ingredient products in Vietnam is worth $6 billion.  That market has not been tapped into by Ireland in any great shape or form.  It became an inescapable fact that much work needs to be done in this area.  A lot has happened since we returned home.  The draft report has been compiled and will issue to members in due course.  We came to the conclusion that we need more personnel from Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland on the ground in Vietnam.  With the ending of milk quotas and the free trade agreement being hammered out between the European Commission and the Vietnamese, this is timely.  We have had conversations with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine since our return.  He has spoken to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and agreement has been reached to fund additional personnel in emerging markets.  The Minister has agreed in principle to use some of that money to fund an individual from Bord Bia in Vietnam to promote the food and dairy industries specifically.<\/p><p>From that standpoint, the work we did with the embassy will bear some fruit.  It became inescapable after being there just for a few days the kind of market that has begun to open in Vietnam, with a lower middle class income range emerging there.  It is important we spread our risk effectively when it comes to the dairy industry outside China.  The free trade agreement that will be hammered out between the European Commission and Vietnam does not just affect Vietnam but also acts as a gateway to the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, countries, with a population of approximately 630 million people.  The Kerry Group has been working in Vietnam and will make an announcement when it comes to a very tiny slice of the milk industry there.  It has a collaboration with an indigenous company and that is really the first kind of enterprise that has taken hold in Vietnam with an Irish-owned company.<\/p><p> Bord Bia's presence is in Shanghai in China and the comment or criticism from people we met in business circles dealing with food is that all our bets seem to be placed in China.  As a result of what is happening in south-east Asia, the idea is that we need to create a presence outside China.  In many respects, Vietnam is the engine in south-east Asia and those people believe strongly that the presence should be in Vietnam.  There is also an issue with regard to where the embassy is located.  The commercial hub of Vietnam is Saigon or Ho Chi Minh City and not Hanoi.  That is also significant.<\/p><p> There is some precedent in the agricultural sector.  The pork market was opened and exports began in 2014.  Work has been done within the Department in that regard.  When it comes to the initial step, the timing is right for that funding of an individual or individuals in Vietnam.  As we learned, the most significant groundwork for contacts within official and government circles has been done over the past ten years.  It has taken that long for our officials in the embassy to create a very substantial and solid contact network within government circles.  The timing is right for these kinds of initiatives because of contacts made over the past ten years.<\/p><p> I will not be mealy-mouthed about the fact that we have helped programmes through Irish Aid over the past ten years and, as a result, this has allowed us access to government circles.  That has proved very productive with respect to government officials and politicians understanding Ireland a little better.  We should capitalise on that, and there is a need for us to use those contacts in an area like food and dairy.  That is the conclusion everyone reached, including us, the embassy and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Since our return, that issue has been solidified, and I believe it will result in additional personnel from Bord Bia being funded to go to Vietnam.  For that reason, it was a positive trip.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015040200002#B01600","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Deputy Deasy has certainly described the trip very well.  I visited Vietnam as Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development in 2013.  It is the only country outside Africa that is a partner country for Irish Aid.  After the Vietnam war - or the war with America, as it is called there - Ireland was very quick to provide assistance and a presence on the ground to help in dealing with a de-mining programme and decommissioning weapons.  Mines still regularly kill many people in Vietnam.  We also deal with minorities.  Another benefit of the Irish Aid activity is that approximately 24 Vietnamese people come each year to Ireland to study in the Smurfit business school and do a masters in business administration.  Others come within other categories, and there is a very strong business link with what Irish Aid has done in lifting the country and providing some of the brightest in Vietnam with good quality business education in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  To some extent, this goes back to the first Irish semi-State body that invested in Vietnam, which was ESB International.  That was under the leadership of Mr. Paddy Moriarty, brother of broadcaster M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh, but unfortunately Paddy is now deceased.  He was the first to bring Vietnamese students to Ireland and he even brought them to his own home in Kerry.  One of those bright students he brought to Ireland is now the Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam.  He regards himself as the Irish man in the cabinet.  We have a very strong link with Vietnam at the highest level at which we can do business.  ESB International, as an Irish company, is still very much involved with Vietnam.<\/p> <p>  We have much to go on and our relationship is very strong.  Irish Aid has been strong for a while and last year we finalised an adoption agreement with Vietnam as well.  Its Minister for justice came here and our Minister went over there.  That agreement has worked out satisfactorily.  As Deputy Deasy stated, with the lifting of the milk quota there is an obvious area for Irish business to engage.  There has always been engagement with New Zealand or Holland and not this corner of the world because quotas have been in operation for 30 years.  I fully agree with Bord Bia and the Kerry Group being involved in that respect.<\/p> <p>  There should be a full-scale trade mission going from Ireland to Vietnam.  Deputy Deasy's comments are correct and there seems to be a perception of putting so many eggs in the China basket, which has taken much attention and time, along with numerous ministerial visits and trade missions.  That is desirable but there are 93 million people in Vietnam, which is growing at a fast rate in Asia, and that presents many opportunities.  There is an incredibly good relationship between the countries, so the opportunities exist.  We should certainly expand on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015040200002#C00200","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1427967000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome the report.  I will ask the clerk to change the foreword to reflect the fact that Deputy Deasy and others contributed in the way they did.  I ask that we do some form of press presentation.  We can send out a press release and flag the success of the delegation and what has transpired since it returned.  In light of the fact we give &euro;12.25 million in aid, it is important for us to have the right structures to monitor that spend.  As has been proven in Vietnam, the structures are there and are being used by other countries which are delivering aid in Vietnam.  From a trade perspective, I cannot agree more with Deputies Deasy and Costello in that having a presence in the country is very important.  It can take many years for a business to build a relationship with a partner in parts of Asia and that requires a lot of investment.  The Government should invest, first and foremost, and put its foot forward because having a presence in Vietnam is essential.  This is especially relevant when we consider the Chinese economy, which has many advance factories built in Vietnam.<\/p><p>The Chinese are looking at that market and their presence there.  All that is based on the cost of labour.  It is important, therefore, for us to be in the middle of that economic activity.  Having people on the ground means they might look at the markets other European countries are exploiting such as Taiwan.  We have raised this previously with various Departments that have appeared before us.<\/p><p> I am delighted the Deputy managed to visit some schools and industry and that he met some project leaders on the ground, which was very important.  As was the case in other visits, time was taken to look at the disability and research sectors.  I support Deputy Costello's view on trade missions.  It is important we have a full trade mission to Vietnam.  I thank Deputy Deasy and the other members of the delegation for their work there and their work since they returned.  We should continue to highlight the aid programme and the strong possibilities for trade as we do our work.<\/p><p> I recommend we accept the report and publish it with the various corrections that are needed in terms of other inputs.

This morning we will be focusing on issues related to the nature and functioning of the commercial real estate market in the period prior to 2008 in the context of the banking crisis in Ireland.  In our first session we will hear from a representative of Jones Lang LaSalle, Mr. John Moran.  Jones Lang LaSalle is an international professional services and investment management firm which offers specialised real estate services, with annual fee revenue of $4.7 billion and gross revenue of $5.4 billion.  It has more than 230 corporate offices and operates in 80 countries.  It has a global workforce of approximately 58,000.  It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.  Jones Lang LaSalle Ireland was established in 1964 and provides a full service offering across all aspects of Irish real estate.  The company employs 80 people and provides services for occupiers, tenants, developers, landlords, owners, banks and institutions.  Services offered include valuation, sales, letting, acquisition, rent reviews, rating, consultancy advice, research and property management.  Mr. Moran is an international director of Jones Lang LaSalle and managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle Ireland.  He is a qualified chartered valuation surveyor and has been in practice for 29 years.  He joined Jones Lang LaSalle in 1986 and has had various roles within the company.  He was appointed managing director in January 2009 and is still the lead director for the investment department.  His day-to-day role, alongside running the business, is advising on the acquisition and disposal of investment properties on behalf of pension funds, life assurance companies, financial institutions, receivers, private investors, property companies and high net worth individuals.  He is very welcome.<\/p><p>Before we begin, I advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and, as they have been informed previously, the committee is asking them to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Moran to make his opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015040200002#A00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427929200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I have provided the committee with a detailed opening statement which I will run through again this morning.  I was asked to comment on issues relating to the nature and functioning of the commercial real estate market in the period up to 2008 in the context of the banking crisis in Ireland.  I will deal with the size and nature of the real estate market in Ireland and I will give a brief overview of Jones Lang LaSalle and the nature of the services that we provide.  I will give broad details of our client base, the sources and extent of funding to the commercial real estate market, the composition of investors in that market, its interrelationship with international markets and investors, and the understanding of risk at the time.<br\/><br\/>My comments relate to the commercial property market though I will occasionally reference the residential market, particularly as it affected land levies.  The Irish retail real estate market is made up of various components.  There is the residential market, the development land and agricultural market, the investment market and the various occupier markets such as offices, retail, industrial, hotels and licensed and leisure premises.  <br\/><br\/>Up to 2008 the commercial real estate market was growing strongly.  There were increased levels of purchasing, leasing and construction activity.  Ireland's economy was performing well with GDP and employment driving the expansion.  It is worth remembering that, at that time, we were the fastest growing economy in western Europe, the second wealthiest economy on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis measured by GDP and we had the fastest growing population in Europe.  During that period unemployment averaged just over 4%, which was effectively full employment.  That is important because the real strength in occupier and investor demand is what was supporting the property market.  That demand was driving activity levels and increases in values and the capital values of Irish commercial investment property increased by 72% in the five-year period up to 30 September 2007, the date we define as the peak of the market in terms of value appreciation.  Property yields were at record levels, which was a reflection of both the strong investor demand and the availability of significant amounts of debt.  The graph on page 1 of my submission shows the 72% appreciation in capital value from Q1 2002 to Q3 2007.<br\/><br\/>This all translated itself into particularly strong transactional activity.  Between 2004 and 2008, &euro;8 billion worth of commercial investment property was sold in Ireland.  The peak year for investment volumes was 2006, with &euro;3.6 billion traded in 12 months.  For context, this compares to the previous record of &euro;1.2 billion in 2005 and an average of &euro;768 million per annum between 2001 and 2004, and they were record levels in comparison with what had happened in the 30 or 40 years preceding that.  In addition to domestic spending, there was also considerable Irish investment activity overseas, particularly in the UK and continental Europe.  The graph shows the spending patterns of Irish investment in Ireland over the six-year period.  All sectors of the market were active, with demand outstripping supply.  Demand was not solely focused on prime assets, with secondary and tertiary assets also trading.  There was evidence of demand across all size categories and activity was taking place in all locations across the country.<br\/><br\/>The investment market was characterised by large amounts of money seeking product.  Demand was exceptionally strong, with the vast majority of transactions involving domestic purchasers.  Values really intensified in 2005 and 2006 and so did attitudes towards investment, with investors seeking to move more aggressively up the risk curve and undertake either development in their own right or in conjunction with developers as joint ventures in search of better returns.<br\/><br\/>Alongside a very strong investment market there were also exceptionally strong occupier markets.  The letting market for offices averaged 2.3 million sq. ft. per annum between 2004 and 2008, totalling 11.6 million sq. ft. over the five years.  This is significantly higher than the 8.8 million sq. ft. in the last five years 2010 to 2014.  The record years for office take-up in Dublin remain 2006 and 2007.  Demand was focused on core, city centre locations, accounting for approximately 60% of take-up per annum.  Traditional banking, financial and professional service companies were driving demand during this period, with a new wave of the technology sector just starting to take off.  Page 3 shows graphically how office take-up compares from 2002 to 2014 and members will see that the peaks were 2005, 2006 and 2007.  In response to that demand there was a response from developers in supplying office construction, with 8.8 million sq. ft. constructed between 2004 and 2008.  This represented a 33% increase on the total stock levels at the end of 2003.<br\/><br\/>The retail market was also performing strongly, with improvements in the economy boosting consumer sentiment and spending.  A number of international chains and domestic retailers were entering the market and trading well.  As demand continued, vacancy in core schemes and high streets was tightening, with limited choice for occupiers.  The market responded to this with a surge in retail development.  Between 2004 and 2008, total shopping stock in Ireland increased from 13.7 million sq. ft. to 22.4 million sq. ft., an increase of almost 9 million sq. ft. and a lot of this was in provincial locations.  By the end of 2008 Ireland had the second highest shopping stock <i>per capita<\/i>in Europe.<br\/><br\/>Other sectors performed relatively steadily in comparison to retail and offices.  Industrial activity was relatively subdued until 2006, when again there was record occupier take-up of 2.9 million sq. ft.  Industrial land values saw significant growth due to a scarcity of supply in areas where people wanted to locate, generally in the south west of the city and in north west Dublin.  Occupiers were predominantly general distribution companies which, as is often the case in the Irish distribution and industrial market, are generally purchasers rather than renters.<br\/><br\/>The values of commercial property adjusted to this strong demand with significant increases over a short period of time.  Rents experienced similar growth, with prime office rents increasing from &euro;40 to &euro;60 per sq. ft. and retail rents such as on Grafton Street increasing by more than 100%.  Industrial premises also saw rental growth but not at the same pace.  The highest rent levels ever achieved in the market remain 2006 and 2007, which is graphically illustrated on page 5.<br\/><br\/>In response to very strong occupier markets and investment markets, development land also saw an enormous increase in activity.  The land market always responds to occupier markets and as activity and pricing grew significantly across all sectors this was also mirrored in development land.  Between 2004 and 2006, the number of deals in Ireland increased significantly, reaching over 250 transactions in 2006.  The market was characterised by strong demand from developers and investors, who were chasing product and competitively bidding on all assets that came onto the market.  In 2006, the highest sale price for a development site was achieved, which was &euro;155 million per acre.  This compares to the current top values of approximately between &euro;35 million and &euro;37 million per acre.  There was a push for higher densities by the planning authorities but, in the absence of clear guidelines, many developers factored very ambitious densities into their land pricing.  The underlying strength of the residential market and residential values also contributed enormously to the high levels of land value that pertained.<br\/><br\/>I was asked to comment on what JLL do in this market so I will run through the details very quickly.  The Chairman has already given members the global overview of the company.  In Dublin we have a full service offering, with expertise across all sectors and processes involved in buying, selling and managing real estate.  This involves investment sales and acquisitions, leasing activity for both landlord and tenant, property and asset management, planning and building services, valuation advisory services, land and research.<br\/><br\/>Our main area of focus is commercial property across all sectors, namely, office, retail, industrial, land and hotels.  We have undertaken some residential work for clients, but this is not a core specialism.  Our client base varies significantly, but historically our largest client profile is institutional, such as pension funds, life assurance companies and banks.  We have also acted for developers and occupiers and provide a broad service to everybody in the real estate industry.  <\/p>  <p>           From our perspective the advice we give to clients is strategic and consultancy-based.  Given that we act for both landlords and tenants and vendors and purchasers, our aims and objectives vary, depending on the instructions, but in any deal we do or any piece of work we perform our duty of care is to the client.  As we act for buyers, sellers, occupiers and landlords, we have no vested interest in the performance of the market.  We prefer to see a steady performing rising market at the rate of inflation rather than the dramatic booms and busts recently experienced.  <\/p> <p> Our firm's staff have the necessary academic and professional qualifications to work in the property sector.  Most of our staff are members of all relevant professional bodies, including the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Society of Chartered Surveyors in Ireland.  Various other professional organisations are represented within the office.  Being a member of a professional body means that one must adhere to a strict standard and ethic on a daily basis.  It is noteworthy that yesterday, for the eighth consecutive year, Jones Lang LaSalle was announced as being one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute.<\/p> <p> I will deal next with the sources and extent of funding in the commercial real estate market in Ireland.  It should be noted that we are not directly involved in the funding element of commercial real estate transactions.  Our expertise is in real estate and the details of funding acquisitions and developments are left for discussions between our clients and funding institutions directly.  While we might introduce parties and provide some background information, specific details of terms and agreements did not involve Jones Lang LaSalle and were not shared with us.  Our view of funding conditions relates to what our clients told us and what was common knowledge in Ireland at the time.  <\/p> <p> Between 2004 and 2008 the largest sources of funding for the commercial real estate market were domestic banks, the UK representatives which had offices here and a couple of European banks.  I do not think I need to name them as everybody knows who they are.  Each bank had a differing exposure and concentration across all sectors.  We were sure at the time that there was a lot of funding available in the marketplace.  We were not involved in final loan-to-value calculations between our clients and the banks, but we are aware that loans were available at high value ratios.  Funding was also available for almost every type of property transaction, whether for a pure investment purchase or a speculative development.  Initially, a significant proportion of the lending was non-recourse, that is, the asset was the only security that the bank held.  With the benefit of hindsight, the practice of borrowers giving personal guarantees to secure debt became increasingly common in 2006 and 2007 and led to significant cross-collateralisation of debt.  Any further detail of funding and lending during this time would be more accurate coming directly from the banks, lenders and borrowers.  Aside from the banks, the market was also awash with a lot of equity, which leads me on to my penultimate comments on the composition of investors in the Irish commercial real estate market.<\/p> <p> The major players in Ireland were domestic and accounted for approximately 90% of all investment volumes between 2005 and 2007.  They were a mix of private syndicates, private high net worth individuals, institutions and developers.  The largest proportion of transactions were undertaken by private Irish individuals or syndicates.  These purchasers were backed by funding from banks, with very limited, if any, pure cash purchases.  There were also a number of purchasers who were backed by equity.  The broad investor profile comes from four sets of investor: private syndicates that used pooled equity and debt; private high net worth individuals who used a mix of equity and debt; and institutions such as pension funds and life assurance companies which purchased with 100% equity.  The developers were the final cohort and used equity and significant amounts of debt.  Over time it became less certain how much actual cash was employed as opposed to equity release lending.  Overseas investors had a limited presence in Ireland during this time, as pricing had intensified significantly and Irish real estate was regarded as too expensive for international investors.  Up until the current cycle, the Irish market had traditionally been domestic in nature, with a very limited international input, other than occupiers.  It was regarded as an expensive market in the period to 2008 and, as a consequence, there was limited overseas investment in Ireland during this time.  I have graphically demonstrated on page 8 of my submission how yields tightened between 2003 and 2006.  They compressed from 6% to 3.7% for offices.  At these levels, international investors were priced out of the market, with more competitive yields available in other European countries.<\/p> <p> A noteworthy feature of the time was that Irish purchasers were not just focused on domestic assets.  Significant levels of Irish money were spent across Europe and the world.  In particular, it was reported in 2006 that Irish investors had invested approximately &euro;3.5 billion in the United Kingdom and a further &euro;2 billion in the rest of Europe and the USA.<\/p> <p> As a real estate advisory firm, it is our job to advise clients on real estate issues.  It is, therefore, imperative that we understand levels and impact of risk.  Prior to the banking crisis, we were advising our clients on the nature and impacts of the property market and how it was performing.  Any advice was informed and reinforced with key primary research data.  We collect and monitor research for each property sector, with some of our data sets dating back to the early 1970s.  We believe our advice was strategic, using our expert opinion to assess, for example, saleability and letting ability at the time.  We would provide details for clients on end-use values based on current market levels, providing strategic advice on sentiment and general market performance.  Any valuation we provided for clients was carried out in accordance with the RICS Red Book Guidance Notes and based on evidence of historical market values.  It is very important to understand valuation reports are not forward-looking documents; they are a snapshot in time based on current market evidence.  It is not within our scope or remit as real estate advisers to put any application to these numbers, particularly in order to generate future projections, unless we are asked to do so.  Our clients take our advice and it is their responsibility to apply our recommendations to their models to generate cash flows, repayment models and profit and loss projections for themselves.  From this, they can formulate their own inputs and assumptions, but that is not a process in which we are involved.  The responsibility for this lies with the property owners and, we assume, their bankers.<\/p> <p> I will give an example of how this worked on an almost daily basis.  There were numerous development sites sold in Dublin at the time.  We would have given numbers to our clients and appraised the value of sites.  We would have said to our clients that they could bid X for them.  Any number of times developers or clients came back and said, \"I am going to bid X plus 20% or X plus 50%.\"  We had no input into these decisions and, frankly, were always unsure as to how they had come to these conclusions.  <\/p> <p> The strong demand from investors and occupiers essentially was what dictated market performance during this period and drove market activity.  It is important to note that a functioning property market is not driven purely by value.  Capital values are often used as an indicator to show how a market is performing.  Value can be affected by a variety of factors.  As well as value, to determine what is a functioning property market we also consider depth.  A more reliable method for assessing whether a market is functioning properly is focusing on demand and supply, using market transactions and depth.  Having  lived through the horrendous recession in recent years we all run the risk of forgetting what the market was actually like in 2005 and 2006.  There was enormous depth to it.  Any asset for sale had a number of bidding investors in competition with one another.  As 2007 and 2008 developed, we saw that there were risks in the market.  The warning signs were a shallowing of the depth of bidders in the market, a shallowing of the depth of occupiers and the fact that house prices had started to wobble.  We noticed that the number of bidders during the sales process had started to decrease significantly.  As a consequence, we advised most of our client base not to participate in the market on the buy-side and, where appropriate, we advised clients to sell.  We did this in 2005, which at the end of 2006 had proved to be the wrong decision.  Anyone who did not buy at the end of 2005 had lost the opportunity to participate in an additional 40% capital growth.  It was only in 2008 that this decision proved to be correct.  I can assure the committee that it was not a populist decision and we were not very popular for doing it.  <\/p> <p> We think our client investors were aware of risks at the time.  The market in Ireland is relatively transparent and it would have been impossible not to have been aware of some of these signs, as transaction processes are open.  <\/p>  <p>         There is reasonable availability for sharing information and data.  Data is a big issue in the Irish real estate market and I will happily talk about it later if necessary.<\/p> <p> Jones Lang produced a transparency index in 2006.  We were ranked the 15th most transparent market in the world which is a \"high\" transparency category.  We are now in the top ten in the world because there have been improvements in transparency over recent years.<\/p> <p> Other participants in the marketplace, such as investors, developers and the banks had the benefit of professional advice, or had significant in-house expertise to assist in their decision-making processes.  By 2008, there was a recognition within the property industry that market conditions were over-heating, however, I do not believe that most market participants realised the extent of bank lending to the property market, and second, that we would ever witness the collapse in value that subsequently occurred, which was due to an extraordinary confluence of global macro-economic events, combined with an over-reliance on debt in the property market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015040200002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427929200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran.

We do not involve ourselves in syndicates and never put together any syndicates.  Our job, with regard to any private syndicate, was to advise it on trying to find opportunities for it.

If the Senator will recall, we had a rapidly growing population at the time.  We had quite significant immigration and there was a view afoot that the population was going to continue to expand and that we were going to have to provide both residential and commercial accommodation to all these new population centres.  Hindsight proves that we were completely wrong.  Did it assist in fuelling development in locations where perhaps development was not sustainable otherwise?  Absolutely.<\/p>  <p>  One point I will make, and which I feel quite strongly about, is there has been a lot of blame delivered at the doors of the banks, estate agents, developers and various other stakeholders.  The town planners in this country are also equally as culpable for fuelling the development boom.  Planning policies were extraordinarily lax.  They were difficult and virtually impossible, and incoherent in a number of respects.  Certainly, in a chase for rates income and in a chase for each town wanting to out-develop each other, they led to completely and totally unsustainable development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015040200002#K02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1427929200,"counter":212,"content":"<p>This is Senator MacSharry's final question and he should keep it brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015040200002#K02700","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1427929200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Mr. Moran mentioned that Jones Lang LaSalle does not comment on the future.

Land is exceptionally volatile in value and that is because it is open to so many various different interpretations.  If there is a one-acre site, for example, and I think I can build 12 houses on that site, I know I can sell them for a certain amount.  I know what it will cost to build them.  I know what my services and financing costs will be.  That tells me what I can afford to pay for the land.  However, if somebody beside me thinks that he can build 50 apartments on it, he knows that the end value will be significantly higher.  His construction costs may be slightly higher but he can afford to pay a lot more for it.<\/p>  <p>  That pertains through commercial land as well.  If I think on an office site I can build a 100,000 sq. ft. of offices to deal with a company of 700 or 800 people and the person beside me thinks he can build 200,000 sq. ft. of offices, different values will arise.  That is where the real volatility around value arises.  The other aspect of it is in a scenario where there were high loan-to-value ratios.  The level of equity that was being put into the transactions was relatively low so when one is operating in a market where values fall by 70% to 75%, everybody's equity gets wiped and I think that is why we are in the situation that we are in where, obviously, loan levels then become unsustainable because the natural buffer that one would expect to be in a normal piece of lending was not adhered to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015040200002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1427929200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Mr. Moran told the committee that Ireland had the second highest shopping stock per head in Europe.

Those tax breaks became a little less attractive after 2002 when the cap was brought in on the amount of income that could be used against them so they did not feature as much.  I believe that the other array of tax allowances that were provided for holiday villages and all the various other hotels, in particular, led to a proliferation of development in some fairly obscure locations where there was obviously no end user demand.  So I think latterly those types of allowances were ineffective and led to overdevelopment.

First, and believe it or not, with &euro;3.6 million being traded, there simply was not enough opportunity in terms of supply in the Irish market in 2006.  There was still a lot of cash washing around the system at the time so people were starting to seek better returns.  There were better returns available in other countries, so people opted for them.  People were also perhaps seeking to \"de-risk\" their strategies to some degree and said, \"I do not need complete exposure of my property investment strategy to Ireland and I would like to take some exposure in London or elsewhere\".  In that context, people invested money in all sorts of God-forsaken places.  There was an element of that involved and a certain proportion of it was fuelled by the same syndicators to whom I referred earlier and who needed to continue to build their businesses.  As well as being active in Ireland, most of those syndicators were also active overseas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015040200002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1427929200,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Am I correct in stating that Irish investors invested approximately twice as much in the UK property market as they did in the Irish property market?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015040200002#M00800","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427929200,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Yes, that is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015040200002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1427929200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>In Mr. Moran's experience, would that have been funded by Irish-based banks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015040200002#M01000","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427929200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Primarily Irish-based banks, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015040200002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1427929200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Mr. Moran referred to his firm's responsibility to its clients and also to the financial institutions.

There is a key lesson to learn about regulation of bank lending.

Development lending should include a detailed assessment, not only of the land value, which is a snapshot in a volatile sector, but a detailed assessment of how the money will be paid back.  We did not feel that happened and there should be sensitivity analysis contained within that.

Members have my submission so I will not read it verbatim but will highlight some of the key points.<\/p>  <p>  Commercial real estate breaks down into a lot of markets and sub-markets such as office, retail and industrial occupier markets, the investment market, the development land market and the hotel and licensed markets.  All these different sub-markets operate independently of one another.  Commercial real estate volumes are considerably lower than in the residential property sector but the value of commercial real estate transactions is considerably higher.  In the absence of a national census or register of commercial property it is quite difficult to do as the committee asked and precisely quantify the size of the market, though some sectoral estimates on stock figures and transaction activity are collated by firms such as ourselves.<\/p>  <p>  Commercial property tends to break down into three distinct elements, which are the development piece, the occupier piece and the investment piece.  What happened in Ireland in the period up to 2008 is that the three distinct sectors effectively merged and real estate developers began to develop accommodation, let it out and hold onto the property for investment purposes.  Invariably they then used it as collateral for other investments and developments.  <\/p>  <p>  Commercial property is, by its nature, a long-term investment.  In general, commercial property is significantly more complex than other forms of investment and much less liquid.  By virtue of the typical size of transactions it is not really a sector that is accessible to all - one needs a lot of money to be able to invest in commercial real estate.  However, the emergence of the syndicate model in Ireland in the late 1990s did enable a larger cohort of investors to get into commercial property.  <\/p>  <p>           CBRE is a Fortune 500 and S&amp;P 500 company with headquarters in Los Angeles.  It has 52,000 employees and its Irish firm is the largest property firm in Ireland.  CBRE Ireland is a multidisciplinary firm and is involved in everything to do with commercial property, be it property sales and acquisitions, leasing, investment sales, corporate services, project management, consultancy or anything else.  In the same vein, we do not act for a particular type of client.  We act for vendors, purchasers, landlords, tenants, developers, etc.  In addition, under the property industry umbrella, we act for significant numbers of third-party providers, such as accountants, solicitors, banks, receivers and so on.<\/p> <p> The research function at CBRE Ireland has the same platform as we have in every CBRE office across Europe, in that we have systems, databases and processes in place.  Our main role is to track transactions and market information.  We track transaction volume, land sales, hotel and pub sales, office and industrial leasing statistics and supply and demand to whatever degree we can.  We also comment on issues such as rents, yields and capital values.  All of this information is inputted into global databases and this enables us to produce pan-European publications and to compare Ireland with other jurisdictions.  It is important to stress that the research function at CBRE operates independently of the rest of the business.  Therefore, my team is not involved in transactional activity on a day-to-day basis.  We observe what happens on the ground and we are charged with giving impartial and unbiased observations and commentary based on our interpretation of market trends from the perspective of property market specialists operating in the business.<\/p> <p> I am not an economist.  This is quite unusual because many of those on research teams working within property come from an economic background.  I come from a surveying background.  I am a chartered surveyor by profession and I am a full member of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, I have completed all my postgraduate qualifications and I am a fellow of that society.  Over the past 20 years, I have been a regular commentator on the commercial real estate sector in Ireland and I produce a range of publications on the market and across all of the sectors.  We produce a significant number of statistical publications on the office, industrial and investment sectors, just as CBRE does worldwide.  The publication we are best known for is our bimonthly report, which is more of a newsy report that provides an update or snapshot every two months in terms of trends and transactions happening on the ground.<\/p> <p> The most significant challenge I have faced in my 20 years doing this job in trying to track the size and scale of activity is the scarcity of data.  Unlike in many jurisdictions across Europe where I have colleagues working, we do not have a national property register.  This has created huge issues, because it is down to private firms like ours to carry out research.  Invariably, when we publish that research, it is claimed we have a vested interest.  Therefore, our research has been a thankless job.  I believe the Government should have established a national property register or system to enable us to track the market better.  Perhaps we can discuss that later.<\/p> <p> The understanding of risk is related to the issue of available data.  Again, we do not have the luxury of a long-time series.  The only independent source of data on the Irish market is produced by a private company, Investment Property Databank, IPD.  I do not know whether members are familiar with the work of IPD, but since the mid-1970s, all institutionally owned properties in Ireland must value their assets quarterly.  These quarterly valuations are what make up the IPD data.  Therefore, the data are not representative of the entire market because the valuations relate purely to institutional assets.  However, the data do give us a good barometer of trends in the market.  As members can see from figure 1, the commercial real estate market in Ireland, for the period for which data are available, has demonstrated a highly cyclical pattern.  This demonstrates the fact that commercial real estate is a long-term investment.  According to this index, the average total return is 16.4% per annum which one would agree is a decent level of annual return.  However, looking at it on an annualised basis, this is hugely cyclical.  Figure 2 shows a table for the years from 2001 to 2008 where this cyclical pattern is clearly evident.  In 2002, we had a total ungeared return of 2.2%.  Four years later that was 24.4%<\/p> <p> Roughly, each cycle has tended to be of ten years duration.  In the period up to 2007, considering the fact that interest rates were rising and we had built a significant amount of property in the preceding years, primarily as a result of the ready availability of cheap and plentiful debt and Government tax policy in place at the time, which incentivised real estate investment and development, it was predictable that the market would turn and we would enter the downward phase of the cycle.<\/p> <p> If we look at what drives property, this can be broken down to four key drivers: the economic backdrop, the balance between supply and demand, funding and sentiment.  If the cycle had followed its normal or expected pattern, as we considered it would at the time, Irish commercial property values would have gradually fallen from peak levels, dipped close to or slightly into negative territory, plateaued and ultimately the cycle would have kick-started again.  For the period from 1976 for which we had data, that was the pattern and what we anticipated would happen.  We did not anticipate the extent of the crash that happened, and the extent to which Irish investors and developers were leveraged exacerbated their losses. <\/p> <p> I will run through each of the four drivers individually, beginning with the economic backdrop.  We are a real estate firm, not economists.  Therefore, our economic projections and assumptions, both from a micro and macro level, came from outside the organisation.  We would have paid huge credence to the ESRI, the ECB and the IMF.  Also, as an S&amp;P 500 company, we would have been very mindful of the ratings agencies, none of which downgraded their projections for Ireland until the third quarter of 2008.<\/p> <p> In regard to the supply-demand balance, I know the committee had someone before it in recent weeks who said the supply-demand balance does not have a bearing.  However, it is critical.  Consider the double-digit house price rises we have seen in Dublin over recent times and the 50% increase in office rents in the past 18 months.  This is due to the under-supply situation we are in.  It was obvious to us in the period up to 2007 that an imbalance was starting to come through in supply and demand.  Cheap and plentiful bank debt and Government tax policy fuelled a construction boom and encouraged the development of both residential and commercial property, much of which occurred in the wrong parts of the country.  Extensive rezoning of land for development across many different local authority areas and the absence of a national planning strategy exacerbated this trend.  In simple terms, we were building too much accommodation, much of which was in the wrong locations.  The pace of development was unsustainable and needed to be curtailed.<\/p> <p> As a firm, we began to warn in 2005 about the potential for over-supply and we welcomed signs that development was beginning to slow down.  Against the backdrop of development continuing to slow down and domestic economic activity remaining strong, as we believed to be the case based on the commentary being provided by the IMF and the ESRI and so forth, a soft landing was plausible in our opinion.  In fact, this was the most likely scenario according to a range of market advisers and participants at that time.<\/p> <p> The third factor, one critical to the committee's deliberations, is funding.  In the context of property, when we worried about funding, all we ever considered was whether interest rates were going up or down.  The likelihood of a global banking crisis removing debt from the equation completely did not enter our thinking.  We believed that the banks were stress-testing borrowers.  A scenario where the global banking system would completely implode and where domestic debt funding would completely disappear, which exacerbated the pace and severity of collapse experienced in the Irish commercial property market, just was not envisaged.<\/p> <p> The fourth influencer, probably the most difficult to measure, is sentiment.  Herd instinct plays a part in the property market and the market is heavily influenced by sentiment.  We took our role seriously and understood that commentary, positive or negative, can influence sentiment to a large degree and that this could influence activity levels and, ultimately, pricing.  As an organisation, CBRE is very mindful of its role.  Any commentary or observations made about the market were made objectively and without influence.  Consider the client base we had and have today.  Talking the market up or talking it down was not on our agenda, because we had clients on every side.  <\/p>  <p>           We believe our commentary always has been open, honest, based on the information available to us and based on our perspective as property specialists.  From our perspective, as I stated the information up to 2007 suggested that a soft landing was the most likely pattern.  We found that a property market tends to follow the same pattern and we refer frequently to a chart, shown as figure 3 in our presentation, which comes from a book written more than 100 years ago by a man called Homer Hoyt.  It follows a study of 100 years of land values in Chicago, in which eight different cycles were followed and monitored, including the gold rush, the arrival of trains and so on.  Hoyt came to the conclusion that a property cycle always tends to follow the same pattern.  CBRE used that graphic a lot in presentations to clients to demonstrate the cyclicality of the market and in turn, to demonstrate risk to some degree.  As members can see, figure 3 typically follows the same pattern but what took everybody by surprise in the crash in 2008 is that it did not follow the normal pattern.  Effectively, we jumped from stage 7, where the real estate market was peaking, to stage 12, where the banks reversed their boom policy on loans overnight.  We skipped all the other stages and that led to the crash being significantly more severe.  Certainly for the period for which data were available, we had never experienced anything of that magnitude.<\/p> <p> Moving on to some of the analysis we do locally, we maintain property databases and again, these follow the same definitions and methodologies as does CBRE worldwide.  We have been tracking what Irish people were spending on investment property and we track every single transaction over &euro;1 million in value.  We can then put that into a global system and look at it on a pan-European basis.  According to our research, Irish investors invested more than &euro;46.35 billion in income-producing assets with a value of more than &euro;1 million in the period between 2001 and 2008.  Were one to add properties that were below &euro;1 million in value, that figure would probably be closer to &euro;50 billion.  I should state that more than 50% of this investment during the aforementioned period occurred in the United Kingdom and 23% in Ireland.  The volume increased year-on-year from 2003 to 2006, peaking at more than &euro;11 billion in 2006.  Unusually, 100% of investment expenditure in Ireland in the period between 2001 and 2008 was by domestic investors.  At the peak in 2006, 30% of Irish investment occurred in Ireland, with 55% in that year occurring in the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p> To put into context how severe was the crash, in 2006 at peak, there were more than 98 transactions of more than &euro;1 million in the Irish market while two years later in 2008, there were only 26 transactions totalling  less than &euro;500 million.  These data were publicly available and were produced in all CBRE research publications at the time.  Anybody who went looking for it could have found it and I suppose it marries the data that were coming out in respect of the amount of lending that was going on.  I have just looked at the peak of the market in the year 2006 to give members a flavour but according to this research, 36% of the investment spend in Ireland was attributable to developers, 26% to syndicates, 20% to private investors, 10% to institutions and the remainder to a combination of different investment funds, pension funds, occupiers, etc.  Outside of Ireland, the proportions were quite similar.  It also is important to note in respect of the types of assets people were buying that Irish investors tended to have a preference for office and retail properties.<\/p> <p> As for development land, we also maintain a database tracking all development land in which we stripped out all agricultural sales and counted everything else.  As members can see, according to that research, which is shown in figure 5, a total of almost &euro;12.5 billion was invested in just shy of 1,000 individual development land transactions between 2001 and 2008.  It is significant to point out that while much of the focus on commercial property tends to be on the land piece, four times that amount was being spent on investment property when one adds it up cumulatively.  It also is important to note that while they will not be included in these numbers, members might remember that in the period between 2001 and 2008, there was a notable increase in the volume of hotel and pub sales in the Irish market, many of which effectively were land sales.  One could also include petrol stations in that regard.  The volume of expenditure is dramatic and increased more than ninefold between 2001 and 2006, according to our data, when more than &euro;4 billion was invested in development land.  In addition to the increases in land values in the period, there was a notable increase in transaction volumes recorded with 59 in 2001, rising to 260 individual transactions in 2006.<\/p> <p> In both figure 4 and figure 5, I will point members to the year 2006 because that was the peak of the market based on transactional information.  Towards the end of 2006 and early 2007, it was obvious that transactional activity had started to slow down.  Members will have seen this in excerpts from various reports from that time.  In respect of funding specifically in respect of the various transactions I have demonstrated to members on these charts, CBRE was involved in some capacity in many of these transactions, be they in Ireland or overseas.  We were also involved in many of the transactions involving Irish buyers overseas and we carried out valuations for lending purposes for many of the purchasers and indeed all the Irish lending institutions.  However, we were not privy to detailed information on how these specific transactions were being funded.  Anecdotally, we were aware that a large proportion of transactions were debt-funded compared with other countries.  We knew that from talking to colleagues in other jurisdictions.  We also were aware of commentary on increases in property lending by the Irish banks and individual financial institutions.  However, we were not privy to the specifics of how particular transactions were being funded, how banks were financing themselves and we certainly were not aware of the extent of cross-collateralisation that was occurring.  Perhaps na&iuml;vely, we presumed that a central register of commercial lending activity tracking borrowers' exposures across different lending institutions existed.  We were not aware of particular banks' exposure to specific individual borrowers.  As I stated at the outset, we are not banking experts and so we had regard to assertions from the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and others that the banks were sufficiently well capitalised and robust.  We were cognisant of ratings given to Ireland by ratings agencies such as Standard &amp;amp; Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.  Based on this, we believed that the Irish banks were well funded and appropriately regulated and that the borrowers were being sufficiently stress-tested.  We had no reason to suggest otherwise and we did not have specialist training or insight or any knowledge that would have enabled us to question this.<\/p> <p> As for lessons for the future, in the period up to 2008, to my knowledge we were not contacted by the Government, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance or the Financial Regulator at any stage for our view on property market trends from our perspective or to ask us for any of the data we were collecting on transactional activity or property market performance.  In general, Government intervention in the property market was largely done without any engagement whatsoever with the property industry and certainly not with firms such as ours.  In the future, we recommend engagement with such organisations that have access to reliable information on trends and transactions, as well as the ability to cross reference this with other jurisdictions and geographies because we believe this would give a valuable perspective to decision-makers and those in authority.  It is encouraging that in its recent Construction 2020 report, the Government has acknowledged the need to improve data collection and analysis to ensure that the real estate sector in the future is evidence-based and underpinned by the best available data.  Had reliable, honest, timely and accurate data been collected historically and reviewed in the context of a national planning framework, the scale of the downturn in the most recent cycle may have been somewhat less severe.  That is my submission in which I have made every effort to address the specific items the joint committee has asked me to address.  I will be happy to take any specific questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015040200002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Hunt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427929200,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hunt for her opening statement.

In the case of Ireland, there were probably several reasons for this, the main one being that many investors simply deemed Ireland to be too small, that the size of opportunities that were brought to the market were quite small.  In the current market, we have lots of portfolios changing hands that are sizeable and this is attractive to investors.  <\/p>  <p>         At that time, however, we were selling individual assets and they were just deemed to be too small.<\/p> <p> We also had a much higher stamp duty regime in Ireland.

That site was bought by a syndicate of rich people and Ms Hunt's company had organised the sale.  After the syndicate had held on to the site for four years, CBRE sold it on its behalf for a speculative gain of &euro;53 or &euro;54 million.

It might well be the case that ten years of a 40 year mortgage will be spent paying for that speculative gain.

We need to put a system in place that shares the benefit of rezoning decisions and speculation with the wider community and not just for the benefit of the owner of the land.  It is about time such a structure was put in place.  However, the political will has not been there to do so.  The only time we saw one step towards that was in the early 2000s when the rate of capital gains tax on land was effectively halved and that brought a lot of supply of land onto the market.  There was a threat that it was going to go up to 60% two or three years hence and that never happened.  There was a step towards doing something about it and then it was reined in, for whatever reason.  However, we are now at a critical juncture.

In some cases it might be.  I think there is also a reluctance on the part of certain people with a remit to give information to provide it to the database.  The form is cumbersome in that it needs three different entities, the actual landlord, the tenant and the solicitor, who all have to fill in a section of the report and nobody is quite sure who has the ultimate responsibility to send it in to the PSRA.

The first lesson is that having a property market that is wholly dependent on domestic investors and developers and primarily debt-funded by a small cohort of domestic banks is not sustainable and I hope we have moved away from those days.  In terms of Government intervention, there should be consultation with the industry before implementing policies to tease out the unintended consequences.  We have mentioned data on numerous occasions.  We need comprehensive data from an independent source and interaction with firms such as ours, which are tracking useful information because if we have that we might be able to spot trends and possible threats at an earlier juncture.<\/p>  <p>  I have been watching closely work done by the Investment Property Forum in the United Kingdom, UK.  It is a cohort of people involved in the property industry and they are doing a piece of research examining the next commercial real estate crash in the UK and how that might affect financial viability.
