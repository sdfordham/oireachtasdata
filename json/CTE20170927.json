The interference from mobile phones affects sound quality and the transmission of proceedings.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, who is accompanied by Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist, Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession, principal officer, and Mr. Joe Cullen, principal officer, from the Department of Finance and Mr. William Beausang, assistant secretary, and Mr. John Kinnane, principal officer, from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I thank them for making themselves available.<\/p> <p>  We are meeting the Minister for Finance as part of our ex-ante scrutiny of the budget.  In terms of best practice, the OECD promotes a whole-of-year approach to budget scrutiny whereby parliamentary engagement on budgeting is continuous and longer-term in nature rather than focused on a set-piece event once a year.  Over time, and informed by the work of the Parliamentary Budget Office, I hope the committee can contribute to developing this approach.  The best way to achieve that is to work with the Minister, in the context of his two roles, on an ongoing basis in order to enhance the process relating to budgetary scrutiny.<\/p> <p>  Before we hear the Minister's opening statement, I draw our guests' attention to the position on privilege, which also applies to officials who may contribute to proceedings.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I the invite the Minister to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#G00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson and members of the committee for the opportunity to come before them as part of the ex-ante scrutiny of budget 2018 and I look forward to a good exchange.<\/p> <p>  During the summer, two main elements of the pre-budgetary process took place with the national economic dialogue being held in June and the publication of the summer economic statement shortly afterwards.  The national economic dialogue allowed for a positive, open and inclusive exchange to take place between a wide range of stakeholders on the differing economic perspectives in advance of the budget.  In line with last year&rsquo;s arrangements, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also published its mid-year expenditure report in July and the Department of Finance circulated the tax strategy papers.  These elements all form an important part of the pre-budget cycle, which has led to a more open, transparent and collaborative approach to the annual budgetary process.<\/p> <p>  Last year, my predecessor published the Finance Bill shortly after budget day.  It is my intention to publish this year's Bill as soon as possible after budget day and not later than two weeks after I deliver the Budget Statement.<\/p> <p>  The economy continues to perform strongly, as evidenced by developments in the labour market and as highlighted in the summer economic statement.  Our GDP growth last year was 5.2%, the highest rate in the European Union, with the European Commission forecasting that the economy will be among the fastest-growing in the EU over this year and next.  Unemployment has fallen from a peak of over 15% to 6.1% in August, and is on track to fall below 6% by the end of this year.  Employment has also increased by over 230,000 from its lowest point &ndash; which translates into a 13% increase.  Domestic demand is likewise growing strongly, with private consumption up 10% during the past three years.  It now exceeds its pre-crisis peak.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the public finances, tax revenues at the end of August were just 0.7% or &euro;209 million below profile.  This equates to a solid year-on-year increase of 4.9 % and we are still targeting an annual tax take of &euro;50.6 billion for 2017.<\/p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s debt levels are still high and we are committed to continuing to reduce this debt burden further as part of our budgetary strategy.  As such, we must be cognisant of the risks to the economic cycle, in particular from the external environment and to plan accordingly.  In that context, the Government is maintaining its commitment to establishing a rainy day fund into which it will put &euro;500 million per annum.  I will be circulating a consultation paper to the Oireachtas shortly to seek views on a range of matters.  These include the nature or purpose of the fund, how to provide for the fund, accessing the fund, the maximum size of the fund and so on.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the budgetary position, I have stated on previous occasions that our objective for next year is to achieve a balanced budget.  This will mean ensuring that Ireland reaches its medium-term budgetary objective in 2017 by achieving a structural deficit of 0.5% of national income.  As set out in the summer economic statement, the fiscal space available for budget 2018 will be of the order of &euro;1.2 billion.  This will enable us to reach our medium-term objective and achieve a balanced budget next year.  As members are aware, only &euro;350 million of this remains to be allocated in respect of specific measures, with the rest already spoken for, due to demographics, carryovers from budget 2017, the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness and the Lansdowne Road agreement.<\/p> <p>  The mid-year expenditure report outlines an increase of &euro;2 billion in gross voted expenditure for 2018.  This increase of 3.5% continues the approach of implementing moderate sustainable increases in public expenditure to facilitate targeted improvements in key public services and infrastructure.  This approach has seen increases for key priority areas.  In 2017, the allocation for the housing programme in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was increased by over &euro;400 million or 50%.  The health allocation increased by almost &euro;500 million or 3.5 %.  The allocation for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs increased by over 15 % this year.<\/p> <p>  One key issue which must be addressed each year is demographic pressures.  These include: additional numbers qualifying for the State pension; and the hiring of additional teachers to address the incremental increase in pupil enrolments.  This can often be characterised as the cost of merely standing still.  Given the need to meet these costs, and also to enhance public services to meet new priorities, there is a clear need for focus on value for money and policy effectiveness.  This is the context in which the spending review was carried out.<\/p><p>Unlike previous reviews, which focused on reducing spending, the aim of this review was to systematically examine existing programmes to assess their effectiveness in meeting policy objectives.  The spending review operates as a complementary process to the Estimates process.  It was undertaken over the first half of the year in order to enable the outputs relating to each area to feed into the consideration of expenditure proposals for the Estimates for 2018.<\/p><p> Investment in public infrastructure is essential to increasing the long-term capacity of the economy.  The significant progress in our public finances has enabled the Government to increase capital expenditure by a further &euro;4 billion over the remaining period of the capital plan to 2021.  This is in addition to the money - &euro;2.2 billion - already committed to support the delivery of the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  On budget day, I intend to announce the allocation of this additional funding.  This reflects a significant planned increase in public capital investment, with expenditure in Ireland more than doubling between 2014 and 2021.  As confirmed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council in its pre-budget submission, this will result in public investment in Ireland moving to among the highest in the EU.  I do not want to repeat previous mistakes, such as when capital expenditure was ramped up too quickly and resulted in inflation and poor value for money.  This is why the Government has set out a planned and sustainable increase in expenditure that is based on evidence and analysis.<\/p><p> The mid-term review of the capital plan, which was published on 14 September, provides the evidence base.  The review includes: submissions by Departments and offices; a public consultation; and capacity-and-demand analysis of our infrastructure completed by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES.  This analysis will be used to inform the allocations at budget time and, subsequently, for the new ten-year investment plan in light of the infrastructural deficits identified in the review.  A key priority in the context of the ten-year plan will be to ensure the coherence of a long-term and strategic approach that fits in with the spatial configuration in the national planning framework.  It will be announced before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#G00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Before calling other members, I wish to put three short questions to the Minister.  In London on Monday, the Taoiseach made some comments about the local property tax.  Can we expect any measures in that regard in the upcoming budget?<\/p> <p>  A number of witnesses who appeared before the committee in recent weeks have said that our tax is out of line with international best practice in that we have a narrow tax base and a high marginal tax rate.  They have suggested that we should broaden the base and reduce the marginal rate.  What is the Minister's approach to that?  Does he have any measures to change the existing tax policy?<\/p> <p>  Charities Institute Ireland sent us correspondence seeking a VAT compensation scheme arising from a working group report in 2015.  Has that been reviewed?  Will the Department address any such tax issues in the upcoming budget?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#H00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I will begin with charities.  I am aware of this matter and a number of Members of the Houses have raised with me.  I am examining whether such a measure could be implemented on budget day.  I am not in a position to go into the detail of particular measures; it is just a case of whether I can introduce them.  That is a matter I will address on the day of the budget.  One of the issues I will be dealing with as we consider this option is how to define what constitutes a charity.  If a measure is implemented, how can we ensure that it does not trigger many demands for equivalent organisations throughout society?<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked about our tax base and the nature of our income tax code.  We had a tax base that was very narrow by international standards.  That is why measures such as the introduction of the local property tax then were important - I know that is the subject of a question.  That is why we aimed at the time to introduce a water-charging system.  The latter did not gain political support but it was driven by that objective.  I am very conscious of maintaining the breadth of our tax base.  We have one of the most progressive income tax systems in the world in that as people earn more money, they pay more money.  On a number of occasions I have flagged that marginal tax rates begin to increase very quickly for those earning any more than a standard wage.  That is a matter on which I believe this Government and the D&aacute;il should make progress.<\/p> <p>  Given that a timeframe for the local property tax has already been laid down, I will be standing by it.  As was made clear by the previous Minister, Deputy Noonan, following the publication of the Thornhill report, we will be looking at changes regarding that taxation - that tax base - from 2019.  I will be sticking to that timeframe.  Any announcements I make prior to that date will be about the process to get to that point.  I am very conscious of the concerns, which have been articulated by others, including the Chairman, to the effect that there may be sudden large shifts in the tax bills people may face.  As the Taoiseach has articulated, we will certainly take that into account in trying to avoid such a scenario.  We will do that work in 2018 and bring it to conclusion at an appropriate point well in advance of 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#H00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I will call the spokespersons for the parties, each of whom will have ten minutes.

The Taoiseach has said that the overriding ambition of this budget will be to balance the books in order to reach the medium-term objective.  Just before the Minister came in, we heard from representatives of the parliamentary budget office.  The calculation of fiscal space is affected by the target of reaching the medium-term objective.  In reaching that objective, the Minister is using a calculation provided by the European Commission.  However, the IMF and OECD use different measures to calculate the fiscal space.  Why is the Minister so wedded to the Commission's method of using those figures given that it has been proven, including by many witnesses who appeared before the committee in recent weeks, that said method is unsuitable for the Irish economy?  In that context, there was a rise in the output gap from last year's budget to the summer economic statement.  What drove that rise?

If that had not changed, the independent budget office believes that the net fiscal space would be &euro;1.8 billion for 2018.  The output gap rose from 1.1% in budget 2017 to 1.4% in the summer economic statement.  What drove that increase?<\/p> <p>  We spent much of the year trying to get our heads around the underperformance of income tax figures.  Various explanations were offered.  Generally, the proposal for USC changes is one of those.  In preparing the 2018 income tax figures, is the Minister confident that they will be accurate?  Will he be able to stand over the target figures he will present on budget day?<\/p> <p>  In recent weeks a number of witnesses have commented that we are moving towards full employment, something that the Minister's colleagues frequently mention.  However, we have a very low labour participation rate at 60%.  Is the Minister considering initiatives to enhance that labour force participation rate?  I ask the Minister to give his views on the impact of the changes in child care costs he announced in budget 2017.  What effect have those changes made to child care costs, particularly in recent weeks?<\/p> <p>  I wish to inquire about two specific taxation initiatives.  What is the Department of Finance view on the vacant site tax?  Has the Minister received advice from his officials on the concept of such a tax and its implementation?  Has he received advice from his officials on the 9% rate of VAT for hospitality and other services?<\/p><p>Have his officials advised the Minister to raise the value added tax, VAT, rate from 9% for hospitality and other services?<\/p><p> We have taken a more moderate view of the economy given threats such as Brexit and the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, described the CCCTB as possibly a bigger threat than Brexit.  What is the Minister's view of the threats?  We also put in climate change.  <\/p><p> What is the likely impact of President Trump's proposals on corporation tax, if they are passed, on our corporation tax base?  What is the Minister's view of the long-term sustainability of that base? <\/p><p> What are the Minister's views on President Macron's proposals this morning, linking agreement on European tax reform to subsidies and to participation in the European Social Fund?  That does not sound like a united Europe.  <\/p><p> Once again, the Health Service Executive, HSE, has an overrun, which it blames on the various changes to public sector pay announced this year.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, stated in this room this morning that no extra money will be given to the HSE this year to account for those extra changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#H00700","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>That is a lot of questions from the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#J00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am trying to get them all in within ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#J00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>There are other members here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#J00400","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>The Deputy can come back in again.

I will not comment on initiatives that might be the subject of debate in another political system and country.  It will make choices on what it will do.  It is very important that we are crystal clear on the nature of our competitiveness and the proposition we offer for attracting and retaining jobs.  As a debate is under way in America on change it is even more important that what we offer is predictable, that people know where they stand and that we are confident that corporation tax is an important part of what we competitively offer but it is not all of it.  I see that in the engagements I am having with many companies in the post-Brexit world which consider the quality of our workers' education, Ireland or Dublin as a location and access to it, our legal framework, our language and so on.  I am confident that, despite the change or potential change taking place in other jurisdictions on these matters, Ireland will continue to have a competitive offering.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question on the CCCTB, President Macron is entitled to outline his agenda on the future of the eurozone, Europe and France.  I am equally entitled to lay out our national interests in those areas.  In respect of the broad economic and monetary union, EMU, and the future of the eurozone, I believe it is in the long-term interests of Ireland, particularly given the change happening in other parts of the world, that we have a more stable eurozone that continues to grow in the way it has in recent years.  Strengthening the eurozone and monetary union in Europe is in our interests.  We believe the key ways to do that will be through the completion of banking and capital union.  Capital union matters to Ireland and Europe because most of our investment is bank based.  Banking union matters because it creates an environment in which we have greater confidence of regulation and that the split between the sovereign and banking systems will be maintained.  In respect of corporation tax policy the current decision-making process will be protected.  We believe the principle of unanimity in respect of taxation matters is a core element of how decisions are made on all tax matters, not just corporation tax.  That is the stance I have taken recently and will continue to advocate.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of VAT I will not comment on individual taxation matters that I will announce on budget day because the decisions will be made that day and any decisions I make now will have economic consequences for today.  I will not go down that path.  The Department of Finance has outlined different options on VAT but the decision is for me and the Government to make.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the vacant site levy is a levy as opposed to a tax and because of that it is a matter that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, is engaged on at the moment.  I am giving him my view on it, that it is a very important measure to change the incentives on land use and I am working with the Minister now on that proposal.  He has already outlined some views on it.<\/p> <p>  One of the first things I said as Minister for Finance, and for Public Expenditure and Reform, was that to be in a situation where our labour market might reach full employment next year, I stress \"might\" because of the risks the Deputy is aware of, is an important consideration in respect of choices I must make.  I will make economic choices only on the basis of what I think is right for the economy overall and the fact that it is growing at the rate it is and that the labour market is improving at the rate it is, are important considerations for me.  In respect of child care costs I can see the effect of the changes in child care regulation and provision at a local level in my constituency and the difference it is making.  In fairness, however, to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, it is very early in the day to say what the long-term effect of that will be because it is a measure that has been implemented for only a few months.  I agree with her point that the Government will take further action if needed, if we get to a point where the availability of the subsidy scheme the Government has made available contributes to higher costs because we are trying to get to an affordable and better regulated position.  <\/p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's question on the legal definition of balancing the books, we are legally obliged to follow the European Commission's definition.  That is what we are doing and will continue to do.  The convergence margin changed because at that point in the year our gross domestic product, GDP, growth was higher than we expected it to be in our original forecasts.  The Deputy is referring to a report he received from his independent parliamentary office.  I have not seen it nor would I expect to.  It is a matter for the Deputy but if there are issues in it that the Deputy wants me to respond to beyond the response I have given I will be delighted to do so.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#J00600","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>What measures is the Department considering to maintain or re-evaluate the VAT rate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#J00700","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will deal with that on budget day.

I have to go to a meeting in UCD so will have to leave shortly after I ask my questions.  I apologise for that.  I am very conscious we are all men present with the exception of the Chairman, which is a bit unfortunate.  I have very good friends on this committee but sometimes when I am listening to our budget analysis, I think it is all about the economy.  We are dominated by economists.  I do not want to be too critical of the Minister but he said he will make decisions on the basis of what is right for the economy as a whole.  We need to think of what is right for our society as a whole when making decisions.  I will cite three examples of strategic cases where it is not just economic interests that are involved.  I will be slightly critical of the Minister's Department but I am coming from my own historical experience.  Deputy Brian Stanley was due in this morning for a 9.30 a.m. meeting of the communications committee.  He arrived an hour late.  He left Portlaoise at 7 o'clock and it took him three hours to get in.  As a result of a historic obsession in the Minister's Department with automobiles as the favoured mode of transport, the Department's inability to cost the benefits of public transport, the fact there is no understanding of the quality of urban life and the need to create public space and invest in cycling, pedestrian and other infrastructure, we have created a completely unsustainable transport system that is desperately affecting the quality of life for our people as well as the productivity of the economy.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman said we need to review our property tax and look at what was proposed back in 2010.  The Department fought that tooth and nail at the time.  We should consider the introduction of a site value tax that at least would signal what we need to do in our national planning framework to go back to the centre and stop the sprawl.  Economists do not seem to have the ability to measure that, for example, one's time on a train is worth more because one can read a book, which perhaps does not have a value.  I put that forward as one of the measures in which we could get a strategic change which economists might not suggest but which make sense.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#K00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Would Deputy Ryan like to ask some questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#K00300","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Yes, that is my first question.  Will the Minister introduce a site value tax as recommended by the ESRI to stop the sprawl?  Most economists come out with the need for a carbon tax.  I have been in favour of a carbon tax but it will not give us the massive scale of change we need to meet the issue of climate change.  We need to go beyond that with radical reinvestment or by changing our investment spending.  We are out advertising how green we are and what a great Origin Green country we are.  We are putting millions into advertising it yet we do not have an organic scheme in agriculture at the moment.  We have hardly anyone working in the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which does not even have a head.  I could go through every single budget line that shows the complete disregard that is historic in the Department.  It never believed in renewables.  It fought against them at every stage.  It needs to change.  Where in this budget will be the strategic shift from the unsustainable low carbon model to a carbon model?  A female member of this committee gave me a book - I know the Minister is interested in books - called \"Utopia for Realists\", which I thought was very interesting.  It put forward the concept of a basic income which I agree with and have been calling for for years.  We need to rethink spending rather than just obsessing about how big the fiscal space is one way or the other.  Let us look at our massive social welfare budget of &euro;21 billion or &euro;22 billion and ask if we could spend it in a different way that liberates our people and is not just obsessed with labour activation, as most people coming in here are.  It is all about the paid economy and people who work.  Those who work in caring work at home do not matter which is the result of all the strategic investment, tax and other decisions we made in the past 15 years.  As we start to get a bit of freedom and a bit of movement, I am interested in looking at different options.  Those who work outside the economy and who have nothing to do with the paid economy deserve our support.  The sort of country I want is one where people have freedom of choice.  It is great to have full employment and to have everyone working but if we continue on with the obsession with the economy and getting everyone working, we will be right back to 2004.  I would love to see a budget that actually brings something different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#K00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Will Deputy Ryan ask a few questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#K00500","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Will the Minister introduce a basic income on a test basis by taking a couple of towns in the country where it would not cost us a huge amount, as was recommended in that book, to try it out and see how it might work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#K00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I do that because the analysis the Deputy has offered of the importance of public transport is one I accept.  I will try to make progress on that in budget day and in the ten-year capital plan to follow because we need to.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question about sprawl and the site value tax.  I agree we need to find ways to ensure the development in our cities is a better development that allows more people to live in it and to make those population centres more concentrated.

It is fair to say, I will not be announcing a basic income scheme for Ireland on budget day.  I have not read \"Utopia for Realists\".  I have read some of the thinking done by George Monbiot, who has a book out in that area at the moment.

We should set up a scheme where communities could come to the Minister.  My understanding of the national planning framework is that it should come from the bottom up.  Communities could come to the Minister and ask him to use them as test case examples.   We need to start being innovative and think differently, outside the box.  We should not just think in conventional economic systems because the current conventional economic model is broken.  Chasing the treadmill of being the fastest, best boy, global capitalist country with the lowest corporation tax is not necessarily where we need to go at the present time.  We should be positioning ourselves as being a safe, secure and prosperous country but one that is willing to think outside the box and do things differently.  Communities could come with suggestions of how they would do things differently and the Department could support it.<\/p> <p>  The problem I have with where we are and the reason I think nothing has changed since 2004 is I looked at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport submission to the national capital review plan and nothing has changed.  I saw IBEC's utterly unsustainable submission to the national planning framework.  It is all about an accelerated roads programme because we do not have public transport projects ready to go.

I will concentrate on a view I hold and which was also expressed by a number of witnesses during our deliberations on the budget, which is that the fiscal space available, notwithstanding debates on whether we should recalculate it this or that way, is simply miserable compared with the requirements to invest in housing, health, education, public transport, climate mitigation and so forth.  There is a list of strategically important areas of infrastructure spending and other forms of spending that will facilitate our economy becoming sustainable and robust in a volatile international environment.  What does the Minister think about that?  It is a very small amount of discretionary space to deal with the scale of the problems, most obviously, urgently and immediately the housing crisis.  With regard to the housing crisis, does the Minister think that the plans, and the resources invested in them, are adequate to deal with the problem?  The Minister has indicated that next year there will be 3,000 council houses and 5,000 social houses, whatever they are.  That is against a background of 96,000 households on the list, although I believe that is an extremely conservative and, frankly, inaccurate figure.  It is a drop in the ocean.  Does the Minister not think we must dramatically increase the investment in social housing beyond what the Government has proposed in Rebuilding Ireland?<\/p> <p>  Social Justice Ireland says we need direct build of approximately 90,000 units over the next few years, whereas the Government's Rebuilding Ireland programme for direct build provides for much less.  From the point of view of fiscal prudence with regard to Rebuilding Ireland, has the Minister calculated the cost of HAPS payments over the next number of years as against the cost of direct build, that is, the efficiency of relying overwhelmingly on HAPS, the private sector and making payments to private landlords, which in Rebuilding Ireland currently represents approximately two thirds of the money going out on housing plans, as against direct build?  I am referring to the financial cost of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#M01900","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>The Deputy should discuss the budget.

Has the Minister done any mathematics on that?<\/p> <p>  Again on housing and property, given the limited fiscal space and the need to raise revenue for housing and other things does the Minister not think that we should seek to have a form of landlords' tax or some taxes to get back some of the enormous profits that have been made by people in the property sector, such as landlords, vulture funds and so forth?  Does the Minister think it is acceptable that he cannot even give us figures, unless he can do so today unlike in reply to questions I and others have asked to date, on how much tax will be forgone on the section 110 tax break?  Everybody knows we are talking about hundreds of millions, if not billions, of euro.  Does the Minister consider it fair or acceptable that we do not know how much tax is forgone under that tax break?  Should we not seek to put special levies or taxes on that profit to give us some extra revenue?<\/p> <p>  Has the Minister thought about or considered increasing employers' PRSI as another source of potential revenue?  We have one of the lowest levels of employers' PRSI in Europe.  It is probably one of the big differences between our tax regime and the regimes of other countries in Europe.  Last year, for example, we proposed that if there was a higher PRSI band for employers' PRSI for people earning over &euro;100,000 it would raise &euro;600 million.  Has the Minister looked at this?

I contend that the employers' PRSI rate and the confidence people have regarding what it will be in the future has been a very important ingredient in the speed of job creation, which the Deputy would have argued would have been impossible a number of years ago.<\/p> <p>  With regard to homelessness and the housing market, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Taoiseach have already said we know we need to provide more homes.

In addition to this, each day we see 80 individuals begin to access housing solutions that make a big difference to their lives.  If we look at the amount of funding we spend on homelessness, we will spend just under &euro;100 million this year on emergency services alone for people who are homeless.

It is of little comfort to someone who cannot get a home now to tell him or her we will have a new home built for him or her in two or three years.  This is where the value of the housing assistance payment comes in.  It enables people who have housing difficulties at present to access solutions in the here and now.  Over time I want to see a rebalancing of this.  The State has a duty to build homes directly for people.  I welcome the decision, and I was part of it, to move to direct build for next year, and allowing local authorities to do this, as opposed to the State competing with private citizens for the acquisition of the limited number of homes.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the help-to-buy incentive scheme, I have received a report on it and I am considering it.  I will deal with it on budget day.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the definition of fiscal space, it might surprise the Deputy to hear I share some of his concerns on fiscal space and how we use it.  It appears extraordinary to me at times that we have debates about fiscal space, which is hundreds of millions of euro, when, for example, we collect and spend between &euro;50 billion and &euro;60 billion per year.  This is why I have made the point that, over time, we should move to what is the right budgetary stance for our country.  What are the right taxation decisions we should take?  Fiscal space is very static and implies that it cannot be changed.

The matter of the long-term direction of Rebuilding Ireland is something I am working on with the Minister, Deputy Murphy, and it is a decision he will make in the context of whether I can make more resources available to him.  I offered the view, which I stand by, that in the long run we want to be in a position whereby as our economy gets back up to normal housing output, the State is either building homes via local authorities for people who need them and in which they can live, or we have a more normal housing market that delivers the type of homes priced at the right level that our country needs.

In respect of the 9% VAT rate for hospitality businesses, or whatever new rate the Minister might introduce in the budget, I asked the Minister a parliamentary question, which was not reached during oral questions, about the number of people in the Department who are looking at the cost-benefit analysis of such expenditure and how some of it could be clawed back.  The importance of tax expenditure is my second point.<br\/><br\/>Third, this is the second Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il budget in that the parties seem to have agreed basic parameters and seem to be delivering within them.  If there is a similar result in the next election which results in a change of position of the partners, I suppose Deputy Michael McGrath will be sitting here with those of us who survive the election and the Minister will be on this side working with him.  What kind of consultation takes place between the two parties to come up with the budget which the Minister will present?  For example, on income tax, I made a proposal last year in my own personal submission which seems quite similar to the proposal the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, has made this year.  Fianna F&aacute;il seems to have a different proposal on USC.  Is that so-called squeezed middle of concern to the Minister?<br\/><br\/>On tax diversification, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, has made some comments, which are quite troubling, in respect of the corporation tax situation beyond 2020 and how it should be prepared for.  On the diversification front, is any work being done on modernisation of tax rates?  Many of us have proposed, year after year, a third, higher tax rate or possible a wealth tax.  The ESRI prepared a very good working paper on a wealth tax, No. 549, which I am sure the Minister has read.  It outlined the possibility of a modest wealth tax raising &euro;1.25 billion on the basis of 5% of our households owning 55% of our wealth.  We do not know the figure because we have no information.<br\/><br\/>My fourth point is on excise.  Does the Minister have a global figure in mind?  We have heard talk of a sugar tax being good for us.  We have heard about diesel rates, even though those of us who still drive diesel cars are apprehensive about this development and so many car makes moved towards diesel.  We have heard about cigarettes and so on.  Does the Minister have a global figure in mind in terms of pushing the fiscal space out through excise duties?<br\/><br\/>To make one final point about debt, there is a still huge chunk of money, &euro;7 billion or so, being used for debt repayments in addition to the net contribution which we now make to the European Union and the fear that contribution will increase after March 2021.  Does the Minister have concerns in this area?  I have raised the issue of the 2018-2020 refinancing with the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#N01900","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>In respect of the plan on which the Minister, Deputy Murphy, is working, he will make that decision but it will be funded.  I am engaged in discussions with him at the moment regarding the future of funding for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for 2018.  Any decision he makes will be in the context of the base funding he had for 2017 and any agreement I make with him on budget day.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the Christmas bonus, there will be another Christmas bonus this year.  I will be in a position to confirm what it will be on the day of the budget.  In respect of refunds of water charges, they will be funded through expected current expenditure underspends which are surrendered to the Exchequer at the very end of each calendar year.  I have a clear idea of where they are at the moment and we will use those funds, which would otherwise be surrendered, to pay for the refund of water charges to those who paid them.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the cost-benefit analysis on the hospitality VAT rate, my Department has offered me an analysis and options for the future of that rate.  That rate, however, like any other taxation decision, is a matter which I will address on budget day.  On tax concessions, the figures which Deputy Broughan quoted a moment ago are in line with the most recent figures available to me.  As he will know, we carried out a report on tax expenditures in 2016.  I will ascertain if another report is available and, if so, I will share it with the Deputy.  The total figure which was available at that time, however, was &euro;5.4 billion.  Those tax expenditures or releases went into a wide variety of different areas, all of which deliver either an economic or a societal benefit.  For example, &euro;550 million was expended on research and development tax credits.  Another &euro;355 million was used for medical insurance relief.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the agreement which my party has with the main Opposition party, Fianna F&aacute;il, we are parties with different political identities.  It made a constructive effort to put a Government in place across the period of this D&aacute;il.  I will honour that agreement, as I expect it will.  As to my future, if I am on the other side of this Chamber in coming years, I will be delighted to be in public life in any way.  I will do my best in any job which I am given.<\/p> <p>  On the diversification of taxes and the Deputy's suggestion for a wealth tax, I have seen few examples of wealth taxes working well in other countries.  I think it would be particularly difficult to implement one within the European Union.  In an environment in which there is freedom of capital and freedom of movement, I would be concerned that were a wealth tax to be brought in, it would look very good for a period and then we would see capital and wealth move out of our country to avoid such a tax, which in turn would have a negative effect on the economy.<\/p> <p>  On the modernisation of tax rates, I do not propose to bring in a third rate of income tax or a further rate of taxation.  In respect of gross tax collection figures for next year, I have an idea of what that figure needs to look like, but that is obviously one which I will announce on budget day.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the costs relating to our membership of the EU and the costs of servicing debt, the repayment levels on our national debt are in line with what the Deputy said.  Our recent publication of the modified gross national income, GNI*, information made the point that if one considers that modified version of national income, which strips out the ebbs and flows resulting from our very globalised economy, we have a very high level of public debt for a small, open economy.  I want to see that debt come down over time, but I do not believe the way to decrease it is by reneging on commitments which we made in respect of that stock of debt.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the costs of our membership of the European Union, the Deputy is correct.  The contribution which we make for membership of the European Union will increase in the coming years as we become a net contributor.  That is something which we will have to factor into our budget calculations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#O00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>We are a net contributor now, are we not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#O00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct.

I will start with the allocation of &euro;4.1 billion in additional capital expenditure between 2018 and 2021 which the Minister referenced in his opening address.  How does he expect that figure to break down during the four years, especially for 2018?  Does he see a clear division of the &euro;4.1 billion over the four years or will some projects be more costly in the second and third year of that period?<\/p> <p>  In terms of health spending, I am mindful that last year's budget saw record levels of funding for the health sector, both in percentage terms and in overall terms.  It made up approximately 25% of expenditure in last year's budget.  With regard to this budget and any future budgets over which he might preside, does the Minister envisage health funding needing to be at that level?  Was there an element of catching up last year due to demographics and the fact we are catching up on a number of years of not being able to spend on that sector?  In broad terms does he see health remaining at the same level of priority, or needing to, from an expenditure point of view?<\/p><p> What are the costings involved in moving towards an equalisation of the self-employed tax credit?  In light of the fact that property prices are rising, has there been an analysis of the impact on capital acquisitions tax?<\/p><p> Regarding the broad area of social protection, the quarterly National household survey, QNHS, saw unemployment down by 55% from the first quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2017, which mirrored a 28% reduction in the live register for that period and a 61% reduction in the long-term unemployment figures.  At the same time, 230,000 people found new jobs, representing a 13% growth in employment.  While I accept that getting the little over 6% of people who are unemployed into labour is more challenging than going from 15% to 6%, what is the Minister's view of the overall social protection budget, given the easing of funding pressures as a result of the number of people who are back at work?  How best can we use the space this creates to promote a better society and improve people's lives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#O00500","speaker":"1237","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>The figure moved to &euro;4.1 billion because we made available a further &euro;1.5 billion, or &euro;500 million for each year from 2019 to 2021.  My expectation from dealing with many large infrastructural projects, be they roads, public transport, schools or homes, is that, due to the length of the planning process and the need to go to tender, the large expenditure on many of them will not begin until that point anyway.<\/p> <p>  As to whether health expenditure will grow, the answer is \"Yes\" even though it is now at its highest level ever.  There are challenges in the form of the cost of new drugs and the nature of our demographics.  Our high fertility and birth rates compared with the rest of the EU have been of unbelievable benefit to our country, and many of our citizens are living for longer.  For these demographic reasons alone, health expenditure will continue to grow.  We must ensure it grows at a rate that meets the needs of those who depend on our health services while allowing us to make progress on many other priorities as well.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the self-employed tax credit, a &euro;700 move in the income earned credit would cost &euro;59 million in the first year and &euro;106 million in a full year.<\/p> <p>  As to the effect of changes in unemployment levels on social protection policy, the then Department of Social Protection, which was led strongly by Deputy Burton across the period in question, went to great lengths to ensure benefits would be available to people facing the difficulty of being unemployed during the economic crisis.  If we move to a position of full employment in the coming years and our labour market continues to be healthy, I expect there to be a strong focus on payments and policies that directly feed through to reductions in poverty levels among certain cohorts of our society.  I hope this focus will become more eminent in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#P00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

In this day and age, I get fed up that myself, Deputy Madigan and a small number of others are very often the only women in the room.  I understand that the Minister and his officials as individuals possibly have nothing to do with this.  However, I have to make the point.<\/p> <p>  The Minister's colleague referred to hidden fiscal space.  I have been told by some that the hidden fiscal space potentially includes the fall in unemployment as reflected ultimately in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's budget.  If my memory serves me very well in respect of a lot of very difficult discussions, the unemployment figures are calculated by DPER in conjunction with social protection and are worked into the base.  Unless there is something dramatically wrong in the estimate of the figures, I fail to understand how that can be calculated as some kind of hidden fiscal space.<\/p> <p>  This goes to the heart of what happened last year, when we had a joke meeting in the morning - with due respect to the officials - and by that afternoon there was &euro;300 million to &euro;400 million extra.  Allied to this, given that this is broadly the third year of a very significant increase in self-employment, whether genuine or bogus, anybody involved in tax would expect a very significant rise in the profile of the tax receipts from the self-employed in November.  I am sure the Minister and his officials are looking at those figures on a weekly basis at this point.  What is his estimate for the surge in self-employed taxes come November?  There is already quite a surge provided in the profile but my view, from all the data and just from talking to people in business, is that it is going to be very significant. <\/p> <p>  The Minister has already said he cannot talk about the budget and so on.  However, if this is &euro;300 million to &euro;400 million, and I think it could be half a billion, the Minister needs to play fair with this committee if it is to have any purpose.  That is important.  Obviously, the issue relates to the so-called hidden fiscal space.  I still do not understand what exactly the Minister means by it, hidden or visible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#Q01400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":161,"content":"<p>On the status of the live register and projections for it, it is a completely different thing from the discussion we are having on the so-called hidden fiscal space.  The Deputy is correct about the forecast for the live register.  We look at this point in the year for next year.  In response to the questions Deputy Lahart put to me a moment ago, I tried to explain that the hidden fiscal space is really the idea about finding efficiencies in respect of money we are spending.  Deputy Burton will know that each year we look at what we expect the live register to be for the following year in the context of how the labour market has been improving over the previous few months.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the Deputy's question about the self-employed, I am not expecting any big difference beyond what we have laid down in the profile for October, November and December.  Any increase that we receive has to be in the context of the fact that the income tax receipts for this year were &euro;220 million or 1.8% below profile by the end of August.

The Government has indicated with respect to a sugar tax and also excise duties, but I imagine excise duties are almost reaching the point of being maxed out in terms of tax take.  Has the Minister at this point scoped any tax efficiency measures which would provide for the closure of areas of evasion and loopholes, which, to be honest, as the Minister is aware, are inevitable?  Tax is like a chess game -  the Minister writes a finance Bill and clever people sit down and work out how to circumvent it.

That is the case.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of minimum yields from certain tax rates, the Deputy will be aware that there are a number of reasons that is very difficult for the country to do.  The tax affairs of every individual in every company are different.  Our tax code is not set in the context of a company or an individual, rather it is set impartially for sectors of our economy and that must be implemented in a way that reflects the individual circumstances of each individual or company.

This committee and the Minister and his officials could do a great deal of good work by agreeing as an output from this committee, with the support of all parties, that we have on an annual basis not only the tax strategy material because that is not directed to this particular objective, but a report on tax evasion and tax avoidance on an annual basis because, as the Minister said, it is a game and it is gamed all the time.<\/p> <p>  I can bring to the Minister, and I will do so, information on all sorts of areas which are being badly hit now, including hospices in Ireland, and I am sure every one of my colleagues could bring him information on other areas.

The Fine Gael manifesto stated that an annual 5% increase in excise duty on cigarettes would bring in &euro;349 million over the term of a Government.  In its manifesto, Fianna F&aacute;il stated that adding 90 cent to the excise duty would bring in an additional &euro;108 million over five years.  The programme for Government notes that reductions in personal taxes such as the continued phasing out of USC would be funded largely through, among other things, higher excise duties on cigarettes and increased enforcement and sanctions on their illegal importation and sale.<\/p><p>However, the tax on cigarettes has gone up since 2007 from &euro;2.07 to &euro;3.35, which is a 64% increase in the period, while the excise from cigarettes has actually gone down from &euro;1.192 billion to &euro;1.098 billion.  The Revenue Commissioners are very clear on this and I want to quote what they say as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Forecast receipts of tobacco products tax use an elasticity measure to partially reflect the responsiveness (or change in behaviour) of smokers following duty and price changes. Increases in duties are forecast to lead to increases in receipts, albeit recognising that some smokers will consume less and consequently some of the increases in receipts from higher prices are negated. Further cigarette price rises, particularly at the higher end, may not increase Excise receipts and this is indicated through the use of the range of estimates above. To reflect the potential variations in consumption change in smokers, the range above is based on varying the elasticities used in the forecast calculation.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#S03100","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#T00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>It is coming now.

I thank the Minister.  The second question is the issue of what is happening in the housing market which directly affects the Finance Bill.  This is about our experiment with REITs.  When one drills into the CSO figures, they are startling.  In Dublin, for example, from 2007 to the end of July 2017, 42% of new houses in Dublin were bought by non-household buyers.  It is a staggering amount.  It is more than those of first-time buyers.  Non-household buyers are predominantly REITs, of which there are three in the market.  There are non-market sales, which are predominantly the social authorities buying up houses, but these 42% are predominantly from REITs.  We have looked at the published accounts of the three REITs.  The rental income was &euro;117 million last year.  While the Department of Finance itself says 85% of investors are foreign, which means that rental income of approximately &euro;100,000, the dividend withholding tax is just over &euro;8 million.  They have an effective tax rate of 8% and that is just on the rental income.  If one looks at the increase in valuations and the fact that they do not pay capital gains tax, their effective tax rate is 3%.<\/p> <p>  It is bad enough that they are paying very little tax on a multi-million euro enterprise, but they are now, because of this beneficial tax rate, crowding out and outbidding our first-time buyers.  We cannot allow a situation to persist whereby our tax code assists these REITs to inflate house prices beyond what is reasonable by buying up 42% of the market in Dublin.  We need to take steps.  We will deal with this in detail in the Finance Bill but we only have a window on that.  We need to take steps to start to rein in the REITs.  When they were introduced, we said we would monitor them very closely.  Time has passed and one can see all the figures in terms of non-household buyers.  They jumped significantly as soon as we introduced the legislation for REITs.  It has failed in terms of what is happening in the housing market.  I ask the Minister to consider measures to appropriately tax REITs and create a level playing field for those first-time buyers and former owner-occupiers who cannot compete with these entities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092700002#T01800","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1506517200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I want to have a housing market in which first-time and any other individual buyers have a chance to buy a home at an affordable level, but there is another side to the coin.<\/p><p>REITs allowed us, in particular at a time of great economic difficulty, to get to a point where we had professionalised our rental sector to a greater extent.  That means rental accommodation being provided in our country that is different to where we have been historically, which has tended to be one individual with one or two rental properties, the aggregate of which was equal to the Irish rental sector.  That is precisely one of the reasons we got into such difficulty in the rental market.  We had so many people providing rental accommodation who were not able to cope with the pressures the economy was under then.  There is a role for institutional companies to provide rental accommodation within our country.

This is the second annual mid-year review meeting of the joint committee covering Vote 29 - Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We are conducting a mid-year review of the Estimates.  The OECD report, Review of budget oversight by parliament: Ireland, for 2016 sets out a roadmap for enhanced parliamentary scrutiny of spending by Departments throughout the budget cycle.  We met representatives from the OECD on a couple of occasions during the past 12 months.  The joint committee is following this roadmap, which contains the following elements: ex-ante scrutiny; budget year scrutiny; and ex-post scrutiny.  The main purpose of the mid-year review is to consider the mid-year position in terms of expenditure and performance outputs, review the utility of performance measures and targets provided and examine the position in the lead-up to 2018.  In essence - and before we reach the end of the year and it is too late to do so - our job is to discover where we stand at the mid-term point in terms of targets and voted Estimates and whether remedial actions are required.  If such actions are required, this is obviously a good time to note them.<\/p> <p>  As per usual, I propose that the Vote will be examined programme by programme, from A to F, under the different headings.  Members will be invited to ask questions about subheads in the context of the relevant programmes.  The committee is particularly interested in programmes containing information that will be useful in illustrating the link between expenditure and performance.  In other words, any high-level metrics.  Following the examination of these programmes, members may wish to address questions to the Minister on the administrative subheads, programme G - appropriations-in-aid - and the environment fund.

It is important that people understand the context of this, however.  To use the analogy of a road, we are trying to bring a motorway to every single home in Ireland.  Everyone has two cars outside their home at the moment but, in the future, everyone in each house is going to have two cars and some will even have a bus or two.  We are now saying that if people decide in the future to set up a freight business, the road infrastructure will be able to cater for that at any stage over the next 25 years.  That is a massive task.  This is a contract for 25 years to ensure that the broadband we install now is robust enough to meet requirements and needs over that period.  Over the last five years, we have seen a dramatic ramp-up in demand for data, and every single digital network in this country is investing and investing just to stand still.<\/p> <p>  We are not just trying to bringing a motorway to every single home, however.  In the short term, we are also looking at the boreens.  We want to cut the hedges, take the grass out of the middle of the road, take the grass verges off the sides and resurface them.  We are doing that through the build-out of wireless and mobile technology.  Given that we have put a pure fibre backbone into 60 towns across the country and pretty much the vast majority of rural villages in the form of open access networks, we can put hot desks into every community in the country.  People in their own, local areas can have access to pure fibre at 1,000 Mbps high-speed broadband, the likes of which is only available in places like Hong Kong and Singapore.  Wireless and mobile operators can improve on their existing level of service and expand into rural areas, into the amber areas, into the 542,000 homes and premises that do not have access to broadband and are not part of the current commercial intervention.  I am determined to make sure that every single one of those 542,000 homes has access to a broadband services as quickly as possible.  We are working with private operators to do that.<\/p> <p>  On foot of releasing the 3.6 GHz spectrum earlier this year, I have had one operator come to me that is looking at a 5G point-to-point fixed wireless deployment, which is expected to cover 85% of the land mass of this country by 2019.  Work is ongoing.  My priority at the moment is to address the issues and genuine concerns of the people on those digital boreens who are not getting access to a broadband service or who are getting access only to an inadequate service.  My priority is to provide them with a basic service pending the roll-out of the high-speed broadband service.  I am satisfied that we are on target to ensure that a minimum of 77%  of premises in this country will have access to high-speed broadband by 1 January 2019.  By 2020, at least 91% of premises in this country will have access to high-speed broadband.  I suspect it will probably be higher than that but I am only committing to 91% until I see the detail roll out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#C00400","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":256,"content":"<p>The Minister has been captured by the big telcos and he is suffering from Stockholm syndrome.  He is looking at the shiny technology they are waving at him and using their verbiage.  In particular, he has been captured by Eir.  It has led to a really difficult situation for the State notwithstanding the Minister's best efforts to get SIRO to remain part of the bidding process.  If the chat around these Houses is to be believed, he has been on bended knee, a bit like the football players in the United States, arms linked with his officials, begging and pleading with SIRO to remain in the race to give credibility to a bidding process that now has no credibility.<\/p> <p>  We have heard the Minister's protestations since he came into office that he needed to be careful and do this right.  He had the big baddies in Europe looking over his shoulder and he was there for the people.  He has lost contact with the people we are seeking to serve, for whom we are to roll out a broadband service.  We are no further on today than we were in 2012.  We are no further on in understanding when that intervention area is going to have a broadband service.  I could go back through the Official Report to when the former Minister, Pat Rabbitte introduced the project and when the former Minister, Alex White and others sought to move it on.  There was talk of a delay of a month, two months, then it became six months.  The Minister has still failed to give this House and those outside these Houses a date for the start of this contract.<\/p> <p>  The Minister used the term \"we\", and that is why I say he has been captured by Eir and others.  He now sees himself as part of a conglomerate: \"We are delivering to 60 towns.\"  I remind the Minister that these are commercial decisions by large multinationals that see a return on their investment for their shareholders and because they give him the benefit of cutting a tape, the Minister thinks he is part of it.  When is he going to get real and start spending the taxpayers' money for the benefit of those 542,000 premises he talks about?<\/p><p>We need action from the Minister.  We need to get this tender through and we need a start date.  The Minister knows from project management experience that unless he sets a timetable projects never happen.  They keep getting pushed out.  If he has a timetable he will have to answer to this House, and I and others will criticise him if he misses a deadline, but it is better to have a deadline and have some milestones as it is good project management to set dates.  The Minister should be prepared to suffer the political consequence of someone kicking him around a bit because he fails to meet the deadlines but that is better than running around hand in glove with big corporations that are just pushing him around.  At this stage they know he will issue a statement, cut the tape and the roll-out to the 542,000 homes is no closer.  The Minister is being tied up in knots.  He should put pressure on the Department and those who are naysayers and set the deadlines.  A total of &euro;7 million of the &euro;15 million is spent and perhaps he will get the other &euro;7 million by the end of the year.  That is not what it is about.  Multiples of that amount need to be spent.  People need to see broadband rolled out to areas that do not have it.<\/p><p> What is happening at the moment is good.  I am pleased that at last Eir has taken a decision to invest in its network.  It is replacing poles that fell over years ago.  It is stringing fibre along them principally into places that already had a reasonable level of broadband.  It is doing it on the edges of villages that were already reasonably close to the exchange and had some element of a broadband service but now they will have fibre.  That is fantastic.  It is a commercial decision so let us not clap ourselves on the back for that.  The question is when will the people who live beyond the edge of the village get a service.  The Minister should move away from taking credit for what others are doing.  He should concentrate on defining the national broadband plan as that which requires State intervention, which falls on his shoulders.  Whatever way the Minister will kick the sand in people's eyes and hope they will somehow get confused, and that he will get to cover himself in some level of glory by taking credit for what others are doing, will not happen because people in rural areas who do not have a broadband service are mightily unimpressed.  They are particularly concerned now that the Minister's courtship of Eir has led to SIRO pulling out, notwithstanding his best efforts, which has led to a situation where the taxpayer will likely have to pay a lot more now because there is not really a competition anymore.  Let us be honest.  There is no competitive environment now for this tender.  As the Minister well knows, prices will be jacked up and the taxpayer will have to pay more money.  That is all because the Minister has failed to get a tendering process in place that is effective and seeks to have a start date and a finish date so that the work can be done on a project basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#C00500","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":258,"content":"<p>It is unusual to be back in the D&aacute;il Chamber for a committee meeting as that did not happen in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#D00200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":259,"content":"<p>That is twice in the one week.

As far as Eir is concerned, one must bear in mind that the company has been asset stripped for so long.

We had built up the telecommunications system.  P&aacute;draig Faulkner was the Minister who brought in the digital system.  In fairness, he was a very progressive Minister.  He was followed by Albert Reynolds and others.  The point was at that stage we put massive investment, approximately &euro;1 billion, into building infrastructure and accommodation.  Now the people who work for Eir go around in their vans.  They do not have any place to go.  They do not have depots.

The reason SIRO has decided to withdraw from the process is that it wants to refocus on delivering pure fibre broadband to 51 towns across the country to 500,000 premises.  As everyone here that has been watching this situation unfold knows, two years ago SIRO announced the roll-out of pure fibre to the towns in question and the roll-out did not happen.  As a result of the commitment agreement I signed with Eir, SIRO pulled up its socks in that regard and by the end of this week both Eir and SIRO will have delivered pure fibre to 100,000 premises.  Given that both of those companies have decided to go down the route of bringing fibre to the door, Enet has also decided to do the same thing, and announced bringing pure fibre to 115,000 homes.  In total, on foot of the work I am doing, the work of the Department and the national broadband plan, we have three companies putting their hand into their own pockets and rolling out pure fibre to 900,000 homes across provincial towns in rural Ireland, including 28,209 farms.  We will have a situation where the village of New Inn in east Galway is now going to have a better broadband service than many parts of New York.  The same is true of villages like Ballymacward and Ahascragh.  That is what is happening on foot of the work being done.  As to whether I am happy that 542,000 people outside of those villages are not getting pure fibre next week or next month, I am not happy in relation to it.  It is an unacceptable situation that they should have to tolerate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#D00900","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":266,"content":"<p>The Minister should get on and do something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#D01000","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>As Senator Leyden knows better than anyone - we represent the same constituency - and Senator McDowell lives some of the time in the constituency, one in every two premises in the constituency will not have access to high-speed broadband at the end of the commercial roll-out process.  That is not an acceptable situation.  That is why I am not only pushing the State intervention aspect of the national broadband plan, to which I will return, but working with the commercial operators to facilitate them in rolling out network in rural areas.  Senator Leyden knows that in our constituency we have a very good wireless operator in Eurona Ireland and Imagine has rolled out network as well across rural areas.  Other investors are now coming in as a result of me releasing the 3.6 GHz spectrum that will provide new 5G services, point to point services.<\/p><p>The mobile telephone companies are also getting involved in that.  That will improve the quality of service in members' homes and businesses and in every rural home and business among those 542,000.  I am anxious that as many of those as possible get a broadband service as quickly as possible.  We are doing that.  Some 171 premises a day are getting access to a fixed broadband service.  There are additional homes being connected every day.<\/p><p> Senator Leyden knows the history of this and he is correct.  Ours was the first country in the world to digitise our telecommunications system.  We were a global leader in that regard.  To go back further, Ireland was also a global leader in being the first country in the world to bring electricity to every home in the country.  We will be the first country in the world to bring high speed broadband to every home.  In fact, globally, everyone is looking at the challenge we have in this regard so they can piggyback on what we are doing.  I accept that it is a complex procurement process.  I would prefer a far simpler process than the one we are going through.  However, I participated in the debates in the House on the electronic voting machines that were eventually scrapped.  I also remember, as does every other rural member of the committee, the great saviour the national broadband scheme was to be.  The contract was signed with 3 and the day it went live, it was obsolete.  This will not be obsolete because this is a 25-year contract.  This is not about broadband for tomorrow, next month or next year, but broadband for this generation and the one that follows.  This contract will ensure the network is built out into every home and premises, including every isolated rural premises, across Ireland and meets the needs of the future.  When this is built out, people in urban Ireland will be demanding the same service as the people in Ballymacward have, because they will be ahead of them in that regard.<\/p><p> Deputy Dooley asked about a timetable and milestones.  He is correct that it is imperative to put timetables and milestones in place.  I was not prepared to sign the Eir commitment agreement unless timetables and milestones were put in place.  The Deputy has not asked me questions on that because we have reached all of our milestones to date for our first, second and third quarters.  On foot of being able to pin Eir to that under the commitment agreement, SIRO has now reached a point where it is passing 10,000 premises every month for pure fibre.  Now, Enet is coming into it.  It is a little disingenuous and inaccurate to talk about the bidder of Granahan McCourt Capital, Enet, SIRO and John Laing Group being a minor player.  It is wrong of the Deputy to give that impression.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#D01100","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I did not mention the word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#E00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>This is a global telecommunications consortium that has a huge wealth of experience.

Enet came into this country and did that by itself on a commercial basis without any assistance from the State.  That is the reason there is an independent backhaul network available in this country.  It is also the reason we are in a position to be able to conduct such a bidding process.  At present, three open access pure fibre networks are being built which allow for wireless and mobile operators to reach the four corners of the country.

The other one was of similar size.  We are in a very competitive process on this.  It would have been nice to have received a third filing cabinet, but it was not critical to the process that we would receive it.  In fact, it will help to speed up the process because we will go through two filing cabinets rather than three.

I asked the Minister the question about SIRO's withdrawal at the press conference yesterday and he went off on a tangent talking about private companies and what they were doing.  I know that and I told the Minister at the press conference yesterday that I am one of the beneficiaries of that in so far as the broadband service to my house on the edge of Portlaoise town has improved.  I accept all that.  I accept that on sections of the local roads - the Minister used the term \"boreens\" but it would be difficult to get to the boreens without going through the local roads first - Eir is improving broadband.

It is the iron law of economics.<\/p> <p>  If the Minister had read the statement from SIRO yesterday on the reason it withdrew, he would have seen it is a completely different reason.

The process has been tilted and skewed.  Those are the facts.<\/p> <p>  What has happened, and Senator Leyden referred to it, but as I recall, his party sold off the company that is now Eir - it changed its name a few times - is that Eir has been asset stripped.

The Minister went on at length yesterday about what all the private companies are doing, which was not the question I asked.  Of course they are.  It is dog eat dog.  The Minister has named the companies involved.  The national broadband plan has become the plaything of the various capital interests involved in it because the Minister has allowed the main infrastructure to be taken over by the private sector.<\/p> <p>  We have no costings or timeline and we have little or no competition.  That is where this process is at now.  It is a logistical mess for anyone trying to bid against Eir.  It is also a financial and a legal mess.  The Minister knows it is complicated because we have not been able to wring a date out of him, even a timeframe of, say, six months in which the procurement process will be completed.  He does not know.  His officials do not know.  God knows we have tried to get answers on that often enough from the Minister.  It was to happen this year.  Will it happen next year?  I do not know.<\/p> <p>  The Minister keeps talking about the rural electrification scheme.  The difference is that, ultimately, the rural electrification scheme was controlled by this House and driven by the people elected to it who had the vision to take a decision.

I hate to see a situation where the taxpayer and the State will be strangled in future as a result of this process and left to finance what are the most difficult parts of this country to reach.  There will be a disproportionate cost put on the State.  It is Joe and Mary taxpayer who will pay the cost of the hard to reach areas.  I understand there would always be a cost because there were 840,000 households and premises to be serviced.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in understand that would need subsidisation.

It may be subconscious but it does exist.  In a situation where one woman in a committee is ready to speak but everyone else is a man, the Vice Chairman should at least take that into consideration.

Everything in this State has been privatised, and that goes to the heart of what is wrong here.<\/p> <p>  The Minister did an elegant job of comparing the national broadband plan to the roll-out of the rural electrification programme.  He stated: \"Just as by building Ardnacrusha nearly 90 years ago, electricity unlocked the potential of a young country, and ensured its survival, broadband will unlock our potential today as Europe's youngest population.\"  All that sounds lovely.  The problem is that when we electrified the country, the State owned the ESB.  It did not have to put up with a competitive, chaotic market.  I do not know if Eir threatened potential litigation against the State if it did not get access to those 300,000 premises in towns and villages because it was doing it anyway.<\/p><p>We may find out some day, but it was given access to those premises in towns and villages to lay cables.  No one really cares about the boreens, bogs and far away bits that come after that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#F02400","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#G00200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":328,"content":"<p>-----besides the State.  Only the body politic and the State care about them.  No one in the market does.  I have listened to people arguing about this company and that company, but companies are not going to make profits going up boreens, up hills or down dales unless we heavily subsidise them.  That is what the taxpayer is about to do to the tune of 60% more than it was meant to cost us in 2016.  When this was rolled out last year, I told the Minister at a committee meeting that it would be brilliant and work well if we followed the model set by Ardnacrusha and the electrification of Ireland.  That would have been in the interests of the State and people and we would have controlled the taxpayers' money.  Under the current model, though, and comparing broadband to electrification, half the country will be left in the dark - the Minister used the analogy of roads, but I will use the analogy of light - because there is not enough profit to be made by these companies.  They will not be interested.  Hence the reluctance of the Minister, his officials and everyone else to give a deadline.  They cannot predict what the market will do.  It is a bag of chaos and does not deliver public services.<\/p> <p>  My final point goes to the heart of the matter.  It is ironic that Fianna F&aacute;il challenges the Minister in the way it does when it was the party that privatised Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  As Mr. Fintan O'Toole said, that company was passed around like a joint at a student party.  It was kicked around the marketplace, leaving it in its current position.  We owned Telecom &Eacute;ireann and got rid of it.  Our State is now trying to do something important, since everyone must get access to broadband in order that people can work, do business, learn and communicate.  However, we are relying on a chaotic market to deliver it as opposed to what we did in the 1950s and 1960s when we delivered electricity ourselves.  Fianna F&aacute;il has significant responsibility for this situation.  It privatised a State-owned company that was doing well.  We might have had a chance of getting ESB, which is part-owned by the State, to do something.  Tragically, it has pulled out as well.<\/p> <p>  Of all public private partnerships, PPPs, this must be the worst.  At least previous PPPs allowed the State to own the assets eventually, be it after 25 or 30 years.  We will never own this asset, having pumped in millions of euro, including 60% more this year and God knows how much more next year.  We will not know, and the Minister cannot give a deadline because he cannot predict what the market will do.  This goes to the root of the problem.  You have made a bags of it, not because you are Deputy Naughten, Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il, but because the whole nine yards of you believe in the neoliberal model, which does not work for delivering this kind of service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#G00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Smith.

I use that analogy.  When Ardnacrusha was built, the Government of the day was told it was mad and that the amount of electricity generated at Ardnacrusha would never be used because there would never be that much demand.  Today, Ardnacrusha produces 1% of our total electricity usage.  It was far-seeing at the time.  I use that analogy because the programme transformed rural Ireland.  I do not doubt that when broadband goes down every single boreen, it will transform rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct, though.  Rural electrification was done by a State company that owned the assets, and it took more than 20 years to build out that network across the country.  I am not prepared to wait 20 years for people to get access to broadband.  I want to see this happen yesterday.  I want it to happen at every crossroads, village and isolated farmhouse throughout Ireland as quickly as possible.  That is why I am not prepared to go down that particular road.  The reality is that, on foot of our interventions, 900,000 premises will get access to pure fibre.<\/p> <p>  I am being criticised for not providing a date.  I will not do so because this is the most complex contract of its type every constructed anywhere in the globe in terms of rural broadband.  All my colleagues across Europe are watching to see what we are doing.  Professor Vint Cerf, who was here last May and is one of the founders of the Internet, acknowledged that what we were doing was pioneering and had never been done anywhere else.  Just like when we brought electricity to every single home, we were the first country in the world to do that.  Just like when Senator Leyden and his colleagues digitised the telephone system, we were the first country in the world to do that.  That we are the first country doing this does mean that it takes a bit longer.  When many of us are gone from the Houses, I do not want my name to be bandied around here because, like electronic voting machines, the national broadband scheme failed to deliver even though a great deal of money was invested in it.  I want to ensure the scheme is like rural electrification and digitisation, which have stood the test of time.  This contract, when signed, will stand the test of time.<\/p> <p>  I have written down my reply to Deputy Stanley just in case I am misquoted.  He stated that the game was over and there was no competition within the process.  Deputy Smith spoke about this being a major blow, but it is nothing of the sort.  It is disappointing and I would have liked to have had three bidders, including the ESB, but the ESB has taken a commercial decision because it believes that there are greater opportunities in bringing broadband to provincial towns in rural Ireland.  Does this affect the bidding process?  No, it does not.  Does it affect the competition?  No, it does not.  That is because we have two very good bidders in the process, one of which has considerable international connections, a global history in this sector, and significant capital and a major electricity company that is involved in telecoms in the UK behind it.  Granahan McCourt Capital, which is known internationally for its telecoms experience, has Enet, which operates the State-owned broadband backbone throughout the country.  I commend Enet on working to bring that together.<\/p> <p>  Twenty years ago when no one else was talking about broadband, I was talking about it in this Chamber.  I know the issue as it relates to every rural community.  I want to ensure every home, no matter how isolated, gets broadband not one day later than is absolutely necessary.  That is why we are working with mobile and wireless companies to provide people with a broadband service today.  That all of this fibre is being built out on a commercial basis allows us to bring hot desks to villages and wireless and mobile services to greater parts of rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I must put something on the record regarding Deputy Stanley's comments on the Eir contract.<\/p><p>The state aid rules require that any State-led intervention in this sector does not disrupt commercial investment.  In this regard, the national broadband plan's State intervention is designed to intervene only in areas where there is no existing high-speed broadband infrastructure and where there are no concrete plans to roll out such infrastructure in the near future.  Those are the rules I must comply with.  If I do not, then colleagues of Senator McDowell will take me to the High Court and the European Court of Justice, thus delaying this process along the lines of the 20 years that it took to roll out rural electrification.  I am not going to accept that.  Yes, I have to be careful and tread carefully through this process, as does the procurement team, and we are doing so.  We have and will have a robust contract that will not only stand the test of time for every single rural home and business in Ireland.  The service will stand the test of time for every single rural dweller across the globe because we, again, will be the global leaders in this sector.  We will deliver the programme and it will deliver for every single home.  I guarantee the committee that it will happen and that it will not take one day longer than is absolutely necessary.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanley used the analogy of reclaiming and draining 840,000 acres of land but cherry-picking the best 300,000 acres.  First, one must install drainage pipes one way or the other and they must have a capacity to drain the rest of the land, which is happening at the moment.  As he well knows, there is no point draining land unless one diverts the entire river away from the land thus allowing the water to get away.  The expensive part is building the infrastructure to the land and ensuring the shores are cleaned and drained until one reaches the river.  All the preparatory work has been done and the drainage pipes have been put down in the field.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#G00700","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>Who controls the river?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#H00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":335,"content":"<p>The big cost and heavy lifting has been done.

I thought to myself can we not make that leap in order that every house would have a fibre connection, and maybe competition between those two wires in getting it in would make sense.  My idea is shot now.<\/p> <p>  I have only one question.  In May, the Minister said the national broadband scheme would be predominantly a fibre to the home solution.  There is a world of a difference between a 30 Mb connection and a gigabit connection that one gets with fibre to the home.

I suspect the majority of the 342,000 homes will be a fibre solution, but technology is changing.  In fact, in one particular town a process is being piloted that involves fibre to the gate and a wireless connection into the home.

It would be helpful if he could mention that to the Minister for Finance in his travels through the corridor.<\/p> <p>  On the reform of public sector broadcasting, we all accept that, in the long term, the licence fee structure is not going to work.  It is an old system with old technology for a completely different era.  What will the new structure be?  I do not know.  That is why I am looking forward to the feedback from the committee.  I am quite open in this regard.  Historically, it has always been the case - Senator McDowell would know this better than anyone - that officials do not want to give away power on policy-making.  Instead, they want to be the ones driving the agenda.  It is the same in the case of broadcasting.  Rather than it being a case of me drawing up proposals and putting them to the committee, I would like to see proposals not just from committee members but also what is coming up organically across the country on this.  I want to acknowledge the role the Chairman and the committee played with the recent forum in Dublin Castle on public broadcasting, which was very useful.  Let us see if some good, novel and innovative ways to deal with this will emerge from that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley is correct the way which information and news is now consumed is different.  News is quite expensive to produce.  That is not just for the State broadcaster but, as Senator Leyden, said for local radio stations.  I had representatives from the provincial newspapers in with me yesterday making that exact case again.  For all of us, it is important we have access to verifiable news output.  Anyone can make an accusation online now and it can spread like wildfire.  We must have some way of verifying it.  Some people on the other side of the Atlantic want to introduce some sort of monitoring of the Internet.  I think that will be impossible.  However, we could have verifiable news sources.  That will come at a cost and how it is funded needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>  On local radio, the committee will deal with the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill next month.  This will look at waiving the Broadcast Authority of Ireland, BAI, fees relating to community radio stations.  Such stations do a tremendous job.  We have the biggest network of community radio stations in the world and still have a significant level of radio listenership.  Reducing the BAI fees for commercial radio stations would acknowledge the challenging circumstances in which they are operating.  I would like far more flexibility in this regard.  We are introducing a bursary for young local radio journalists.  I would like that expanded to print journalism as well.  We should be proud of the fact that we have excellent quality journalists.  The reputation of our journalists is second to none.  If one looks at what exists throughout Europe and across the globe, it is all about \"clickability\" rather than accuracy.  We always traditionally had a good standard in Ireland.  I would like to see that continue but that comes at a cost.  I accept that we should use some of the public service funding to do that.<\/p> <p>  On Senator Leyden&rsquo;s point about Dublin-orientated radio gatherings on Fridays and at the weekend, part of the problem is that we, as people from outside Dublin, are not prepared sometimes to participate on such programmes.<\/p><p>At one stage, when I was a member of the party, Fine Gael could nearly put its members in a taxi.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party was in a similar position.  It was very difficult for us and we had a responsibility to travel to broadcasting studios.  The issue can be addressed by having more broadcasts from outside Donnybrook, which comes at a cost.  In addition, politicians and others must offer themselves for interview.<\/p><p> One of the biggest problems I have in filling positions on State boards is that the vast majority of applicants to the Public Appointments Service are, first, men, and, second, based in Dublin.  I ask Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith to encourage female colleagues to apply for these posts.  I also call on colleagues from rural constituencies to encourage people in provincial towns and rural areas to apply for positions on State boards in order that I will at least have a choice.  I suspect this is also part of the problem for researchers in RTE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#J01000","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":362,"content":"<p>On programme B, is the Minister satisfied with the way in which matters have been panning out with RTE in recent years?  Is he satisfied that the position regarding the collection of the licence fee has become more sustainable?  The rate of non-payment hovers between 14% and 17% of all households or premises.  I am concerned that \"Viper\"-style tactics will be used to collect the licence fee, with An Post being moved out of the way and a heavier handed approach being taken.  None of us would like this to happen.  I have made suggestions to the Minister on how to address this issue because none of us wants the licence fee to be increased.  The obvious course of action for a business experiencing a rate of default on payments of 17% would be to capture payment from those in default.  The key issue is to avoid increasing the licence fee for householders.  I do not use language such as the term \"consumers\".  This is supposed to be a republic and we should refer to citizens accessing or using services rather than consumers consuming goods.  People should be treated as human beings, not consumers.<\/p> <p>  If we do not do this right, the licence fee will increase.  I do not need to rehearse the arguments on the use of flat-rate fees.  A single parent on &euro;221 per week has to find the same amount of money as those on much higher incomes, including the Minister and me.  The same applies in the case of a person on the minimum wage.  The licence fee should not increase for these people.<\/p> <p>  Maintaining public service broadcasting means ensuring its financing is placed on a sustainable footing.  The best way to achieve this is to reduce the level of non-payment among households and premises, rather than hiking the cost of the licence fee for people on low incomes, including single parents, those who are in receipt of social welfare payments and individuals who make beds and clean rooms in hotels for the minimum wage.  The cost must be spread by capturing more of the population.  I have made suggestions to the Minister on how this can be achieved, including through the use of modern technology, suppliers and service providers.<\/p> <p>  I am glad Senator Leyden raised the issue of the gender pay disparity in RTE.  Claire Byrne comes from my home town of Mountrath in County Laois.  I cannot figure out why someone like Ms Byrne is on less money than a male colleague doing the same job.  I do not get why Sharon N&iacute; Bheol&aacute;in, who co-presents \"Six One\", is paid less than the male newscaster sitting beside her.  However, I also do not get why people are being paid &euro;400,000 per annum to talk to people on the telephone for one hour per day.<\/p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has raised the issue of bogus self-employment in the context of workers being disadvantaged, particularly in the construction industry where employers use bogus self-employment.  I understand certain staff in RTE are not direct employees.  Given the power of the State and legal profession, surely we can do something about this practice in the public service broadcaster.  Nobody, not even God almighty, is worth &euro;400,000.<\/p> <p>  A good point was made about the commentariat.  We hear the same stuffy old heads on radio shows every weekend.  On the issue of casting the net wider, it took Sinn F&eacute;in two years to get one person onto a certain weekend radio programme.  This was 15 years after section 31 had been abolished as a result of one of the good deeds of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, Michael D. Higgins, when he was a Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#K00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I assume Deputy Stanley will support the President's candidacy if he stands for election again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#K00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I did not say that.

It is a case of groupthink, although there is some very good public sector broadcasting on RTE.  \"Prime Time\" tends to be good and there are good presenters, including Claire Byrne, Miriam O'Callaghan and David McCullough.  However, some of the broadcasts at the weekend are shocking and feature the same stuffy heads all the time.  This needs to change because citizens are paying for it.  There are individuals who are willing to appear on these programmes and certain organisations which never receive a call to feature on it.  There are people who are not members of political parties or not directly involved in politics who would be very good on radio.

One has to ask how that aspiration can be squared with the notion of a television licence.  Going back to the days of Martin Corry, the State was so afraid of radios that it thought it had the right to prevent people having them in their homes unless they had licences for them.  This was long before television.  Radio was considered something the State had to control completely.  One had to have a permit to have a radio set in one's house.  That was the situation.  The television licence is the younger brother or sister of that arrangement.  It is completely inconsistent philosophically to say that there will be high-speed broadband in every house, on the one hand, and that people need a licence to have a television set in their house, on the other.  Curiously, we had a reference to my house in Roscommon so I might as well say one thing on it.

An Post has plagued us since then trying to get us to prove that we do not have a television in the house.  It is curious that, if we have broadband in the house, we can look at the RTE player and not be liable for a licence fee, while, at the same time, if somebody has a normal mobile television in a caravan down the road from us, that person is liable for a licence of &euro;160.  There is something inconsistent in all of this.<\/p> <p>  The Minister's predecessor, Pat Rabbitte, came up with the idea of having a charge on every home.  Logically, he was correct.  I really do believe that he was logically correct.  He got a bit of stick because he said that only people who live in caves do not have access to a television.  He put his chin out for that and got clobbered.  The reality is, however, that if it is the Government's policy to bring broadband to every house, it is absurd that somebody should be liable for &euro;160 extra per year if he or she puts a particular piece of apparatus at the other end of that broadband rather than a computer.  I know the Minister is a cute man and has not put his chin out where Deputy Rabbitte's chin was.  He has asked this committee to come up with ideas as to how the matter should be dealt with.  Let us be honest, the fairest thing to do would be to make the fee collectible as part of the local property tax..  That tax applies to every home in the country and the biggest and best homes pay more than the smallest, most modest homes.  If a fraction of that income were to fund broadcasting, the fee would be collected most easily.  <\/p> <p>  People forget that for many in this country to earn the &euro;160 which must be paid for the privilege of having a television rather than watching programmes on-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#L00300","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The computer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#L00400","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>-----the computer, they would have to earn &euro;320 gross.  That is what they must get in their wage packet to bring &euro;160 home.  It is a huge burden on many families.  As Deputy Stanley said, the cost is not equitably distributed among the people of Ireland when one thinks about it.  If the most modest household, struggling with the greatest adversity, has to come up with &euro;160 and the wealthiest family with the greatest income, living in great opulence, has to come up with the same amount, it is not a very fair distribution of the cost of broadcasting.<\/p> <p>  One of the problems that would arise if the Minister did what I am suggesting and shaved off a part of whatever local property tax is paid is that the money would go to the Revenue Commissioners because it is they who collect that tax.  It would not go to An Post and the &euro;12 million subsidy given to An Post in collection fees would be withdrawn, which would add to its financial difficulties.  Unfortunately, that is not a good reason for leaving things as they stand.  In the short term, the Minister might not want to come up with another &euro;12 million for An Post, one way or another, in order to make it viable, but paying it to collect this licence fee is very inefficient.  There are advertisements on the radio about what one can do with the &euro;1,000 - dental work and the like - fine charge for non-payment of the licence fee.  The whole idea of constantly campaigning to get people to pay the licence fee, having little pieces of paper coming into every home saying that the inspector is in the neighbourhood and so on,  is baloney.  There is a simple way out of this.  Having said all of that, it would be collected much more cheaply and much more easily if that were done.  Even an empty home would be liable for the broadcasting charge if it was collected in that way.  The Minister has to grasp that nettle.<\/p> <p>  On the other end of the process, I notice that &euro;190 million out of this fund is projected to go to RTE every year.  I fully respect the needs of public service broadcasting and I take on board what other people have said about the need for authentic, reliable media.  I will not repeat their comments.  The Constitution itself refers to the press and radio, as it was then, as the educators of public opinion, so I have no problem with any government having a strongly pro-Irish media policy and supporting a quality medium, especially in this era of fake news.  I do, however, agree with Deputy Stanley.  I do not believe that there is anyone in Montrose who, if told that there was an upper limit on salary of &euro;250,000 or &euro;200,000, would go elsewhere.  I do not believe anywhere else in Ireland would offer them more money.  Some people would say that this is rich coming from a barrister, but I not believe there is a market for their services at all.  I know that if a barrister who was useless said that he or she wanted X or Y, he or she would be told to take a hike.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#L00500","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Is that why the Senator is here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#L00600","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":377,"content":"<p>That is why I am here.

If it was collected in the way I am suggesting, that is as a fraction of local property tax, it would be more fairly, efficiently and definitely collected right across the country.  There would be no evasion.  It would be impossible to evade it as one cannot evade the local property tax.  It comes back and is charged on one's estate or whatever.  There is provision for hardship in that tax as well.  People can defer it and so on.  It is time for the Minister to grasp that nettle.  The Minister must come out and say that is what he will do, though he must be more subtle than my good friend, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  He does not need a report from this committee to tell him that it is the way to go.  There is no other way to go except to leave the system as it is.

I am not suggesting that one can pay peanuts and get monkeys.  That does not apply.  As I have said previously, I strongly believe the way to collect the fee is the way I am suggesting.  Having said that, I emphasise that the local property tax needs to be reformed.  I was interested to hear the Taoiseach saying he intends to fight might and main to ensure it does not increase.  As he is in charge, it is not a matter of him fighting might and main.  He makes the decisions.  He is not facing some other group of people who want it to increase.

I would like to support Senator McDowell.  The report we have to compile will be important.  I think there was consensus at the beneficial event we held in Dublin Castle.  RTE is doing an important job.  Local radio and print media also need support.  Indigenous media are facing real problems in the digital environment that is being created.  We need to change the licence fee system quickly because our media are in urgent danger.  I agree with Senator McDowell's suggestion that there should be a complete change.  It should not just be a question of looking for a tender for a slightly different means of collection under the same system.  The current approach is inefficient, iniquitous and drives people mad.  It is time to change the collection system.  There are other mechanisms.<\/p> <p>  As a committee, we have worked to examine the issue of transmission rights.  I think we need to move quickly on the broadcasting Bill that is due before the House so that RTE is given the power to negotiate to get revenues from this source.  The revenue support for Irish media can be strengthened in a variety of ways.  It is not just about the licence fee.  We should be looking at transmission rights.  The Minister should act boldly and quickly on that.  I expect that representatives of Sky and TV3 will say that all of this is nonsense when they come before us on Tuesday.  They will bend our ears to tell us how brilliant they are.  From my viewpoint, what Senator McDowell says is right.  We need to be quick.  We need to protect and support local indigenous Irish media in a way that does not just hit the householder but spreads the burden more widely.  We need to look at a variety of low-hanging fruit.  I just wanted to make that point.  I think it is absolutely appropriate.  I imagine that we will have our report by the end of this month.  I hope that will help the process.  The Minister does not have long to do this.  I think it has to happen quickly because our media are in difficulty.  We have to recalibrate how we fund them.  I am not just talking about RTE; I am talking about other broadcast and print media as well.  One of the things that came out of our forum is that these difficulties are being encountered across the media in general.  Broadcast media is not the only sector we need to support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#M00700","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Deputy Eamon Ryan said it all for me.  I do not dispute anything he has said.  Despite what some people have said, I think it was important that the committee was involved in this.  I refer not only to the input of the committee but also to its role as a forum for all the interest groups in this area.  Although the forum could have met behind closed doors to meet all the interest groups, the approach that was taken enabled the public to engage in the committee process.  This is about serving the public.  I think it is better to use the committees to do that than to ask a firm of consultants to come back with a glossy report, having consulted A, B and C.  I will defend my reasons for using the committee for these purposes.  I know I was accused of kicking the matter down the road.  I have been a member of committees for long enough.  I know that everything is submitted to us as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  We are given a report and told we can like it or lump it.  I gave the committee an opportunity to look into this complex area.  It is not just about the provision of funding; it is also about what is done with that funding.  I want to be crystal clear in this regard.  I have absolutely no intention of increasing the licence fee.  I do not believe that the people who are paying for everything should have to pay more for the people who are prepared to pay for absolutely nothing.  One will find that it is the same people who pay for nothing in every case and not just in the case of the licence fee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#M00800","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Like in the case of Apple.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017092700002#M00900","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>If we move to a universal-type charge, I would expect to see these costs decreasing rather than increasing.

We are bringing high-speed broadband to every home in Ireland.  We have to look at the issue of the television licence.  We will also have to look at many other issues, including home working.  The need for resources in the context of commuting will change.  There will be a demand for refurbishing homes, particularly in villages.  At the end of next year, nearly every village in Ireland will have pure-fibre, high-speed broadband.  There is an opportunity to revitalise those villages, particularly by bringing families back into them.  Deputy Stanley knows as well as I do that there is no one living on the main streets of many towns and villages across the lakelands region.  One cannot buy a pint of milk in many of them.  Now that there is pure-fibre broadband outside the door of these premises, we can bring young families and new and innovative technology businesses into those locations.  Deputy Stanley made a point about service providers and accessing the information that is there.

I have been asked to address the committee on enumerated and unenumerated rights in the Constitution as they relate to the committee&rsquo;s work, and on the effect of either repealing or replacing Article 40.3.3o.  I will address each of these matters in turn.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Constitution protects a variety of personal rights.  Some are expressly set out or enumerated in the Constitution, mainly in Articles 40 to 44, including the right to life, good name, freedom of expression, etc.  The courts have also recognised certain unenumerated or implied rights, which are protected, notwithstanding that they are not specifically listed in the Constitution, for example, the right to bodily integrity, the right to travel, and the right to marital privacy.  Though not listed specifically in the text, if recognised by the courts as being implied by the provisions and values of the Constitution, they are protected just as if they were enumerated in the text.<\/p> <p>  The Constitution empowers judges of the superior courts to judicially review laws, and invalidate them if they violate the provisions of the Constitution, which includes violation of express or unenumerated constitutional rights.  It is permissible for laws to restrict rights, but this must be done in an proportionate manner, that is, rights should not be restricted more than necessary to achieve some other important objective and, overall, the harm done by the restriction should not outweigh the benefit.  The courts also defer to some degree to the Legislature&rsquo;s determination about the need to restrict rights, and offer particular deference in instances where the Legislature is balancing two rights against one another, but courts can and do invalidate laws when it is shown that the Legislature restricted rights irrationally or disproportionately.<\/p> <p>  Before the insertion of  Article 40.3.3o, the Constitution did not contain any express reference to the right to life of the unborn or to the regulation of abortion.  The courts also never handed down judgments that directly addressed the constitutionality of any particular legal regulation of abortion.  However, the courts did recognise several rights that might have had some significance for the constitutionality of abortion laws, and made some comments to this effect.<\/p><p>The courts suggested on several occasions in the 1970s and 1980s that there was an unenumerated right to life of the unborn.In 1995, reflecting on these comments, the Supreme Court suggested that the courts, before the insertion of Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>, had recognised the right to life of the unborn as an unenumerated personal right.  On the other hand, the courts had also recognised a right to bodily integrity, and a right to marital privacy that had encompassed a right to have some access to contraception.  This might have grounded an argument that restrictive abortion laws could have been unconstitutional as a violation of these rights.  However, the courts had given significant indications in the 1970s and 1980s that this was not their view, and that the implied rights recognised by the courts could not be used to challenge a prohibition on abortion. <br\/><br\/>Although we cannot know for sure &ndash; since no case was ever brought to test this &ndash; these comments suggest that, before 1983, a liberalised abortion regime, had it been enacted, might have been deemed unconstitutional as a violation of the unenumerated rights of the unborn child, whereas a strict limitation on abortion would probably not have been unconstitutional by reason of the privacy or autonomy rights of women.  With the insertion of Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>in 1983, the right to life of the unborn was given express textual recognition, and given equal weight to that of the mother, and the consequences of this are well known.  <br\/><br\/>I have been asked to comment on the difference between repealing and replacing<i><\/i>Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>, and what the consequence might be for relevant constitutional rights.  I am taking replacement to mean, in this context, the replacement suggested by the Citizens' Assembly, that is, replacing Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>with a provision empowering the Oireachtas to have some exclusive competence<i><\/i>in this area.  I am happy to discuss other versions of replacement if the committee wishes.  The question is what rights might exist if Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>was simply removed, and what might this mean for laws passed in this area and in light of this, should something be inserted in the Constitution to replace the Article. <br\/><br\/>First, it is crucial to stress that neither of these proposed changes to the Constitution would have an immediate or automatic effect on the legal position on abortion<i>.  <\/i>The legal position will remain whatever is contained in law &ndash; currently the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 &ndash; unless and until the law is changed by the Legislature or is invalidated by the courts.  However, as will be discussed, if the Judiciary held a legislative solution was not compatible with the Constitution as amended, this could have the effect of altering the legal position.<br\/><br\/>The first option is simply to remove the text of Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>and not put anything in its place.  This seems straightforward, because if the Constitution says nothing explicit, it might be inferred that it will have no role to play, and we might assume that the matter will be regulated by law.  However, it is not so simple.  This outcome is certainly one possible consequence of repealing the Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>without replacement, but there are other possible consequences as well.<br\/><br\/>The other possibility is that the repeal of Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>without replacement does not remove the issue from the bailiwick of constitutional rights, but rather leaves it to the courts to determine how constitutional rights should affect the regulation of abortion.  The courts could hold that the right to life of the unborn continues to enjoy constitutional protection as an unenumerated right, as it did before the advent of Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>, or as a facet of the rights of children under Article 42A or the right to life generally under Article 40.3.  On the other hand, the courts could hold that the right of autonomy, bodily integrity or privacy of women extends to the question of abortion; or they could hold that both of these things are so.<br\/><br\/>All of this turns on complex questions of constitutional interpretation of the meaning of repeal.  In the event of repeal, it would be open for a well-situated person to challenge the law on abortion as a violation of one of these sets of rights and ask the courts to find the law unconstitutional, and it is very hard to say with certainty what the courts would do.  There are several possibilities.  First, the courts could hold that one or both of these sets of rights exist, but decide that they will defer to the legislative determination of how to balance these rights.  Second, the courts could hold that neither set of rights exists, and the Constitution does not speak to the question of abortion.  Third, the courts could hold that the right to life of the unborn, even when no longer expressly mentioned in the Constitution, was protected and strong enough to render a liberal abortion law unconstitutional.  Fourth, the courts could hold that the autonomy, privacy or bodily integrity rights of women were strong enough to render a restrictive abortion law unconstitutional.  In these latter two cases, the courts could rule that the rights were disproportionately infringed by the law, and this would limit the Legislature in making a new law regulating the area, changing the scope and content of the regulation of abortion.<br\/><br\/>It is very difficult to say with certainty which of these options would prevail in the long run.  Any assertion to the contrary offers a certainty that is not available.  For my part, in the short term, the first or second option seems most likely, based on the current viewpoints of courts and their attitude of respect for legislative determination of complex social issues.  However, in constitutional law, viewpoints change and shift, the composition of the courts is altered and what seemed previously unlikely becomes plausible.  Even if a court seems unlikely to intervene at the moment, we generally do not write constitutions for the here and now, but for the long run.  The option of repealing Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>without replacement leaves the question of judicial intervention open in the future, with the possibility of courts invalidating a law regulating abortion, requiring either a more liberal or a more conservative regime.  If this were unpopular, it could only be changed by a referendum to change the Constitution to overturn the judicial decision.  This creates uncertainty about what laws the Legislature can pass, and whether the Legislature alone will formulate the law in this area.  It will be for this committee to consider if the best course is to leave open this risk of judicial intervention or to try to reduce it.<br\/><br\/>A way to limit this uncertainty is to remove Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>and replace it with a provision conferring upon the Oireachtas exclusive<i><\/i>power to regulate this area and balance the competing rights involved, to foreclose or limit the possibility of judicial intervention.  I take this to be the suggestion made by the Citizens' Assembly.  Rather than allow judicial intervention in this controversial area, this approach prefers that the legal position on abortion would be set by a democratically accountable legislature, that this legal position would be certain and not open to invalidation or restriction by the courts and that the legal position could be changed using the ordinary process for amending laws if views and outlooks shifted.  Again, it will be for the committee to decide if these benefits would warrant adopting this approach.<br\/><br\/>It should also be noted that there is nothing, <i>per se, <\/i>improper about denying the Judiciary power to intervene in certain areas.  The Constitution excludes judicial consideration of several major matters, including emergency legislation, various matters related to the operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas such as parliamentary privilege and the directive principles of social policy set out in Article 45 of the Constitution.There are several means by which this could be done, to different effect.  First, to state that the Oireachtas is specifically empowered to legislate on this issue.  Second, to state this and further state that it should be for the Oireachtas to balance the relevant rights involved and third, to state that the Oireachtas should be empowered to legislate on the issue and that judges cannot invalidate such a law on the basis of constitutional rights.<br\/><br\/>It is not clear that the first of these options would have the desired effect.  Specific empowerment to legislate for an issue does not immunise such legislation from judicial review.  One would probably have to go further and suggest some exclusivity in respect of the power of the Legislature.  The second option, by expressly giving the Oireachtas the job of balancing relevant rights, would strongly indicate to the Judiciary that courts should not intervene to invalidate the solution made by the Legislature.  The third option might go further still, clearly excluding any judicial intervention.  There are also various other options along this spectrum.  There are different forms of words that could be used to achieve these outcomes.  Examples from our own Constitution, past amendment proposals, and the constitutions of other countries all provide possibilities.<br\/><br\/>In considering the removal of Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>and its constitutional regulation of abortion, a most important consideration is the role of constitutional rights and the Judiciary in the aftermath of this change.  Ultimately, this question requires careful consideration of democratic accountability, certainty and predictability, and the desirability of judicial intervention in the regulation of abortion.  The question put to the people should be formulated with these matters in mind, so that the people can have a clear understanding of the possible consequences of their vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I have been asked specifically to address the question of legal certainty.  While it is quite appropriate for this committee to be concerned with legal certainty, we must accept that absolute legal certainty is not achievable.  Rather the aim might be to create a reasonable level of legal certainty.  This is one that makes clear the scope of the legislative power of the Oireachtas, although it may still require the exercise of judgment in determining whether a proposed legal enactment is within that power.  It may also be subject to a finding by a court that this judgment was inaccurate, resulting in some or all of a piece of law being struck down.  In my view, both simple repeal and repeal and replace allow for a reasonable level of legal certainty, although in the case of replace, much depends on the wording that is proposed. <\/p> <p> Furthermore, legal certainty is only one interest to be pursued in respect of the reform of Article 40.3.3o.<\/p><p>Any change proposed should be such as to ensure that it does not tie the hands of the Oireachtas completely. <b><\/b>Constitutions should enable the organs of state to govern effectively, that is, to respond to the real governance needs in society which shift and change over time, within constitutionally articulated limitations.  They should also enable a state to meet its international human rights law obligations of which it is currently in breach.  In other words, constitutions should stand the test of time. <b><\/b>They should enable government to meet the needs of those it governs and, arguably, that is not currently the case.. <br\/><br\/>Article 15.2.1<sup>o<\/sup>of the Constitution provides that the Oireachtas has the power to legislate for all matters and Article 15.4 requires the Oireachtas to legislate in a manner consistent with the Constitution.  Thus there is no uncertainty about the power to legislate for abortion as a general matter.  At present, the scope of the power of the Oireachtas to legislate is also clear as it is outlined in Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>.  This limits the power to such an extent that the Oireachtas cannot legislate for reforms as proposed by the Citizens' Assembly without constitutional change.  In my view the assembly&rsquo;s proposal as to constitutional law reform should be read in its context and as per its intended effect, which I read to be as a proposal designed to make explicit the power to legislate for abortion to the extent recommended in the legislative proposals made by the assembly.  The question of legal uncertainty really relates to how to ensure that the Oireachtas has the power to legislate to the extent recommended by the assembly, although whether it would pass a law of that kind would be a matter for the Oireachtas itself.  In this respect, the constitutional and legislative questions should be considered separately.  The constitutional question relates to how to ensure the Oireachtas has sufficient power, while the legislative question relates to the exercise of that power.  I am dealing here with the former.<br\/><br\/>In its session last week, this committee expressed concern about how to ensure the constitutionality of legislation that might follow a referendum.  I take this as being related to uncertainty about what rights either the foetus or the pregnant woman would have following simple repeal.  There are three potential outcomes.  First, repeal would remove the express right to life of the foetus.  Women&rsquo;s right to access abortion care would most likely be seen as part of already protected rights such as to bodily integrity and privacy.  These rights are qualified and may be limited, provided the limitation is proportionate.  If this is the outcome, then the Oireachtas could legislate for abortion according to the same rules and principles as it does in all other areas of governance that have implications for rights.  A second potential outcome is that repeal would remove the express right to life of the foetus but other un-enumerated or implicit constitutional rights of the foetus would be unaffected.  The extent of those rights is currently unknown.  This might substantially constrain the scope for the Oireachtas to legislate to make abortion care more widely available than is currently the case.  The third potential outcome is that repeal would remove the express right to life of the foetus and mean that women had a right to access abortion care in Ireland, which right might be unlimited.  That might substantially constrain the scope for the Oireachtas to legislate for limitations to abortion care.<br\/><br\/>While all three outcomes are possible, my view is that the first option is the most likely.  Under that approach, the constitutional rights of pregnant persons which are undisturbed by repeal of Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>, that is, all ordinary constitutional rights that women would have on a day-to-day basis anyway, would continue to apply, as would the obligation only to legislate in conformity with the Constitution.  Repeal would most likely be interpreted as empowering the Oireachtas to legislate for abortion unconstrained by foetal constitutional rights but it would be open to the Oireachtas to pursue the legitimate aim of preserving foetal life by imposing time limits or limiting access to certain grounds.  In doing so, however, only proportionate limitations on the rights of pregnant persons could be imposed.  While the courts would ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution, in the first instance the Oireachtas would be advised as to its likely meaning by the Attorney General and would legislate accordingly.  In other words, the Oireachtas would need to approach making law about abortion in the same way as it approaches the rest of its law-making functions.  <br\/><br\/>As to the options for reform, the first option is a simple repeal of Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>.  The power of the Oireachtas to legislate would continue to be guaranteed under Article 15 but the scope of the power might not be fully clear.  This is because the foetus may have some continuing constitutional rights and of course, the pregnant person would have her full constitutional rights.  She may also have a constitutional right to choose.  The exact scope of these rights may need to be determined, probably by a court.  It is reasonable to expect that courts would take into account the assumed intentions of the electorate in voting to repeal.  Legislation for abortion introduced after repeal would need to ensure that any limitations on the rights of pregnant people are proportionate.  A court could strike the legislation down if it were an unconstitutional interference with rights.  A simple repeal would thus produce a reasonable level of certainty similar to that within which the Oireachtas ordinarily operates.<br\/><br\/>A second option is to remove Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>and replace it with a provision that permits abortion in limited circumstances, for example, rape, incest, risk to life or fatal foetal abnormality.  Such a provision would produce some legal certainty as it would make it clear that legislation for abortion is permitted in respect of the specified grounds, subject to those grounds being defined with sufficient specificity to allow for legislative action.  A change of this kind would greatly limit the power of the Oireachtas to legislate and would not address the most prevalent reasons for women in Ireland accessing abortion care.  It would produce an unduly complex and detailed constitutional provision.  It would constrain the power of the Oireachtas to react to medical, scientific or political developments in the future.  It would be cumbersome and impractical, unlikely to stand the test of time and it would be inconsistent with the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly.<br\/><br\/>A third option is to repeal Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>and replace it with a negative provision, such as &quot;Nothing in this Constitution shall prohibit abortion as regulated by law&quot;.  This would make explicit the power to legislate and allow future change through the legislative process.  It would likely be interpreted as resolving uncertainties about the impact on the power to legislate of any residual and un-enumerated rights of the foetus.  It would also leave open the potential for the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 to remain in place, although it would be vulnerable to constitutional challenge.  It would leave the extent of a pregnant person&rsquo;s rights in respect of reproductive autonomy to be determined.  It would be open to the Oireachtas to pursue the legitimate aim of preserving foetal life by imposing proportionate limitations on the rights of pregnant persons.  It would enable the Oireachtas to legislate to meet the needs of the electorate and would produce a reasonable level of certainty similar to that within which the Oireachtas operates in other contexts.<br\/><br\/>A fourth option is to remove Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>and replace it with express rights to bodily integrity and self-determination in medical decision making.  This would not tie the hands of the Oireachtas, although it would effectively compel legislation on abortion as the Protection of Life During Pregnancy A 2013 would almost certainly violate such an explicitly guaranteed right.  It would address in a broad sense the need for autonomy in reproductive life and thus go beyond abortion.  It may have further unanticipated or undesired impacts around, for example, end-of-life decision making, although limiting it to bodily integrity during pregnancy might address that concern.  It should be noted that the latter point is not made in the written submission to the committee.  The courts would determine the exact parameters of the right.<br\/><br\/>A fifth option is to remove Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>but to regulate abortion through legislation prepared and published in advance of the referendum and entrenched in the Constitution.  This would echo the approach proposed in 2002.  Inasmuch as it would create legal certainty it would do so by calcifying abortion law and making it immune from the normal processes of politics, law and governance.  The meaning and operation of the legislation would be subject to judicial determination, potentially making it highly complex and difficult to use.  The legislation could never be amended without a further referendum, even for minor technical changes.  It would not be changeable without referendum, even if it resulted in violations of international human rights law and would thus likely fail to stand the test of time.<br\/><br\/>Of the options I have outlined above, the first - simple repeal - and the third - repeal and replace with a negative provision - seem most fully to ensure a reasonable level of legal certainty, the ability to govern effectively and stand the test of time and the ability to ensure compliance with international legal obligations.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to take questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Fiona de Londras","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506515400,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank Professor de Londras.

I do not have a paper prepared, unlike my co-speakers.  I will speak to the committee on the subject that I was asked to address.<\/p><p>I hope this is helpful and if it is not, please stop me.  I gather I have ten minutes.  I am not known for my brevity but we will do our best.<\/p><p> I have practised in the area of the application of the eighth amendment and I understand that the committee would like an idea of the practicalities and how the courts balance rights in cases concerning the eighth amendment.  The long and the short of this is, on the substantive issue of the life of the mother versus the life of the foetus, if I could put it in those extremely crude terms, that balance has already been struck by the Supreme Court in the X case and that test, decided by the Supreme Court in 1992, is still the test that is applicable in any case where the right to life of the unborn is in any way in conflict with the right to life of the mother.  The important point to note about that provision is that all one is doing is balancing a life with a life.  One is not balancing a life with health, welfare or any of those matters.  One is balancing a life with a life.<\/p><p> The amendment specifically states these are equal rights.  It is the equal right to life of the mother.  If one has two beings with equal rights to life, how does one balance that?  That is exactly what happened in the X case.  In the X case, the argument before the court was, first, the unborn has a right to life, the mother has a right to life and one can only intervene to save the life of the mother if the mother is facing certain or inevitable death.  Therefore, if she suffers from a condition that will result inevitably in death or imminent death then one can intervene but anything short of that did not permit an intervention.  That was the argument made by the State.<\/p><p> In the High Court in X, the High Court judge stated there was a threat to the life of the young Ms X, who was 14 at the time, but the threat to her life is nothing compared to the threat to the life of the foetus if the judge does not grant the order - the High Court judge was asked to grant an order preventing Ms X from travelling out of the jurisdiction to avail of an abortion.  If the injunction was not granted, then there is a certainty that the foetus will die whereas it may or may not be the case that the mother would die - there is not absolute certainty about her death.<\/p><p> The Supreme Court looked at that test and decided that it, in fact, did not vindicate sufficiently the right to life of the mother.  In deciding how it would do that it was, in the first instance, urged by counsel on behalf of the young woman that the real test was if there was a real and substantive threat to her life and not if there was an imminent certainty of her death, and it did not matter how that threat arose.  Whether it arose from some kind of physical illness or whether it arose from a threat of self-destruction, if that was a real and substantive threat, that was sufficient.  That was ultimately the test that the Supreme Court adopted, while making it clear that it was a threat to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother.<\/p><p> How did the court do that?  How did it decide that the threat to the life of the mother was sufficient?  What it did was to look at the Constitution as a whole.  It looked at the social function of women and girls and the sort of constitutional rights that pertained, and it stated it was important.  It is interesting, when one looks at the judgments, most of the judges regard themselves as harmonising constitutional rights and not deciding on a priority of rights.  They looked at girls and women and their interaction with other parties.  This was a young woman who was there with her parents.  She had a relationship with her parents.  They had a relationship with her.  She had certain social functions.  They took that into account.<\/p><p> It is most clearly explained in the McCarthy judgment where he says the woman is the \"life in being\", the unborn is the \"contingent\" life and everything depends on the life of the woman in being, and one looks at her role and one looks at her function within society.  It is acknowledged in the McCarthy judgment that it is always going to be the case that the foetus would face certain death because the choice is abortion or not abortion, and that is not the basis on which one approaches the test.  One looks at the substantive threat to the life of the mother, one evaluates that, and if there is a real and substantive threat to her life then she is entitled to avail of abortion.  That is the only case that actually determines the test where one has that kind of situation.<\/p><p> Since then there has been a remarkable paucity of judgments concerning it.  It has not arisen that anybody has brought a case before the court to look at that test again because, of course, the Supreme Court was saying no constitutional interpretation is ever immutable for all time.  It simply has not arisen.  What one has is the application of that test and-or a consideration of the right to travel because, one should remember, when X was decided there was no right to travel.  In fact, one of the discussions in X is not only whether one is entitled to an injunction preventing this young woman from travelling, but whether one is entitled to an injunction at all on the basis of whether she has a constitutional right and should her life be vindicated, and in those circumstances whether there is a right to an injunction preventing her from availing of abortion services.  That was the first question.<\/p><p> The second question was can one grant an injunction against a person in these circumstances if the person is simply going to travel to another jurisdiction to avail of a service that is lawful in the other jurisdiction.  The Supreme Court did not come to a binding determination on that point but the majority indicated that their view would be that one could grant an injunction.  Two of the judges took the view that one could not and the other three stated that one could grant an injunction in those circumstances.<\/p><p> After the X case, there was a further referendum which introduced the right to travel as an independent right in the Constitution.  Subsequent cases, after X, also looked at the right to travel aspect of it.

The case law is about children ranging in age from approximately 13 and a half years to 17 years.  The young woman in X was 14 years of age.  The person in the C case was a young woman in care aged 13 and a half years who was suicidal.  The High Court determined that she satisfied the test in X that there was a real and substantive threat to her life as a result of her reaction to the pregnancy.  She had been, as is described in the report, brutally raped and as a result, had become pregnant.  She was considered to have satisfied the X test, but Mr. Justice Geoghegan, in his judgment in the High Court, said that if one is dealing with an Irish teenager who wants to travel abroad, the travel amendment did not give an independent right to travel.  It was to prevent one from being injuncted from going abroad for an abortion, but effectively what he stated was that it did not allow an Irish court to sanction one going abroad for an abortion that one could not have got in Ireland.<\/p><p> That case was not appealed to the Supreme Court because he found on the test the young woman in question satisfied the dicta in the X case and there was no appeal by either party.  That was a case which had effectively been brought by the HSE to ask the court what its rights and duties were in relation to this child.  <\/p><p> The last case in that series is the Ms D case in which Ms D claimed that she was not suicidal.  She was a young woman in care, aged 17 years, and was in circumstances where her child was suffering from a fatal foetal abnormality and had a condition that was incompatible with life.  She wanted to travel to avail of an abortion.  She was very clear that she was not suicidal.  She was distraught at the diagnosis but she was clear she was not suicidal.  Mr. Justice McKechnie in a largely extempore decision in the High Court decided that she had a right to travel, she did not have to apply to the District Court for liberty to go and there was nothing in the statutes or Constitution that prevented her from travelling.  Once again, this is a case with a child in care.<\/p><p> Most of the case law that has arisen involves children or other women who do not have legal autonomy because they may be refugees or are in the immigration or asylum system.  Those cases have not actually come before the court as cases where there is a dispute about whether or not the mother is entitled to avail of services; they have come before the court in other ways and the court has not had to make a decision on the substantive issues involved in the eighth amendment.<\/p><p> I do not know if that was helpful but I will answer any questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506515400,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I thank all three witnesses for their presentations.

It is an interesting point and I am eager to know what the others think of this.<\/p> <p>  To save time, I will indicate which witnesses my particular questions are for.  My first question is for Professor de Londras and Dr. Kenny and relates to Mr. John O'Dowd's presentation to the Citizens' Assembly.  He asserts that the judicial statements made before the insertion of the eighth amendment to the Constitution relating to any rights of the foetus may not be binding as they were not necessary for the decision in any of the relevant cases.  Do Professor de Londras and Dr. Kenny agree with this assessment and do they think it could be the case in any post-repeal judicial decisions on the right to life of the foetus?<\/p> <p>  Professor de Londras and perhaps the other witnesses could comment on the next two questions.  Is trying to achieve legal certainty the most important value to consider when amending the Constitution?  The eighth amendment, particularly the X case, has prevented the courts from considering all of the pregnant woman's rights in abortion cases.  Is it fair to say that if the eighth amendment is removed those rights are reinvigorated and cannot be suspended?<\/p> <p>  My next question is to Dr. Kenny and Ms O'Toole because Professor de Londras outlined this matter in her presentation.  Does she think a referendum on wording which repeals Article 40.3.3o instead of replacing it to include explicit exceptions-based grounds for abortion such as in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, rape, incest, or risk to health in the Constitution is a strong legal construct in the overall framework of constitutional, judicial and legislative laws.<\/p> <p>  This question is directed to Dr. Kenny who in his opening statement said it was not improper to exclude certain areas in the Constitution from judicial consideration and listed emergency legislation, among other legislation, as an example of such an area.  Does he think that abortion legislation should be treated in the same way, constitutionally, as laws passed when the State is under threat or at war?  It seems unusual to me that it would.  I would like to hear his justification for continuing to treat abortion as an exceptional constitutional case.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Ms O'Toole.  There have been many high profile cases and ones in which she has been involved directly.  Can she tell us more about the cases which make it to the court and maybe where legal advice is sought and where the treatment during pregnancy is not in relation to abortion but the wider issue on how the wording of eighth amendment has had an impact?  We have heard her evidence today on the likelihood of various post-repeal judicial review scenarios.  Given that she has direct experience in legal practice of how the Judiciary has previously balanced those rights between a pregnant woman and foetal life in the Constitution, what is her professional opinion on the status of a constitutional right to life of a foetus following a potential deletion of Article 40.3.3o and how would it be balanced against the rights of a pregnant woman?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#J00300","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1506515400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I agree entirely with Mr. John O'Dowd's statement that anything before 1983 would not be binding.  I referred to it in the paper as obiter comments in so far as the court was commenting in passing on something not directly necessary to decide.  Moreover, in the event that they were being considered after some sort of change, one would have to consider what would repeal have done in any event.  Even if they were binding, they could not have been binding in exactly the same way, given that the Constitution had been changed and changed again in the meantime.  One would have to consider what those changes would actually do which is where the uncertainty comes from.  It is created by that doubt.<\/p> <p>  On whether certainty is the most important value, it is largely for this committee to decide where the values fall.  The committee has to consider what a level of certainty is in the context of the issue which it is considering.  Is there anything in particular about this issue that warrants a particular level of certainty and, as the Citizens' Assembly apparently felt, warrants a level of certainty that protects it from judicial intervention.  It is for the committee to decide if there is something specific about this context which would suggest that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of a general view, it is obviously an issue where judicial intervention has caused a great deal of public controversy and major political controversy in various places around the world.  That could be something that the committee considers relevant but that is entirely a matter for its consideration.<\/p> <p>  Professor de Londras discussed the repeal with specific grounds, and I agree with her on that.  She described it as cumbersome and impractical and that is exactly right.  It would require a level of detail that is incredibly difficult to do in constitutional text or some other constitutional mechanism.  It would lock in something that would require substantial elaboration and leave no room to adapt it on the ground or change it if a problem arose.  It is very hard to do from a constitutional law perspective.<\/p> <p>  On judicial exclusion, I was merely listing examples and was not giving an equivalence when I spoke about emergency powers.  I was just noting several instances where it happens, so I do not want to suggest an equivalence.  For a softer example, Article 45 excludes a variety of socio and economic rights and entitlements from judicial consideration.  It is not merely the most extraordinary considerations where the Constitution allows for certain things to be removed from judicial competence, for whatever reasons seem right to the politicians proposing an amendment and the people voting on it.  It is for the legislators and, ultimately, for the people to decide if something should be included in the scope of judicial intervention. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I share Dr. Kenny's view that Mr. John O'Dowd was precisely right in his argument that the statements preceding 1983 were <i>obiter<\/i>.<\/p><p>For the sake of fairness and completeness, we should also note that we have two conflicting High Court judgments.  I mentioned them on page 10 of the longer submission the committee has received from me - IRM <i>v.<\/i>Minister for Justice and Equality and Ugbelase and Ors <i>v.<\/i>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2009 - where there are conflicting <i>dicta<\/i>about whether or not the right to life is the only constitutional right that the unborn, as the constitutional term goes, currently holds in Ireland, so there is a persistent uncertainty and I believe that it is under appeal to the Supreme Court.  <br\/><br\/>On the question of whether legal certainty is the most important value, I think it is for this committee and eventually the electorate to decide on that but it is certainly not the exclusive value.  That would be the first point I would make.  Second, when thinking about legal certainty, it is important to consider what legal certainty might mean.  In the context of the regulation of any form of health care, but let us say abortion for these purposes, there are various actors who need varying kinds of certainty.  The Oireachtas needs some degree of certainty to know what it can do to the same extent as one knows in any case what one can do.  The courts at least need some degree of clarity around what they think it is that the electorate might have meant.  Medical practitioners need certainty about what they are permitted to do.  As Ms O'Toole mentioned, public authorities with people in their care who may have pregnancies that they cannot or do not want to continue with need certainty about what they do.  People who seek abortion care need certainty about what they can do.  I am not sure any constitutional provision could secure certainty across all of those levels.  It is a mixture of constitutional provisions, legislation, principles, working principles, protocols and so on that goes across a wide range of agencies.  <br\/><br\/>Regarding the last point about whether repeal of Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>would mean that the other rights which women hold under the Constitution would simply be reinvigorated, I agree entirely.  I made that point in my submission that any idea that the right to life or competing right to life might have a form of primacy over those other rights not relating to life allows those rights to come back into the fold in a fuller sense and that is where proportionality analysis would come in, as it does in other rights-related situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Fiona de Londras","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I propose to address the questions that were specifically addressed to me.  Regarding the repeal, amend or delete front, my colleagues have outlined pretty extensively to the committee what the implications of each of those courses are.  The difficulty is the uncertainty created by simple deletion.  One will simply never get certainty.  There is no single legal provision anywhere where one could say with certainty what it means but there are degrees of uncertainty.  This is an area where, primarily, women at the centre of the difficulties need to understand in a very time-sensitive way what their rights are and how they can be accessed, they need to be able to take advice and it needs to be clear.  That kind of certainty is very valuable.  Having said all that, it seems that trying to put complex provisions into the Constitution is simply impossible and makes it very difficult.  One is trying to get very complex ideas into a couple of sentences and it is very difficult to do this.  The eighth amendment is a very good example of that because at the time it was passed, there were opinions about what it meant and what its effects were which were not borne out over time.  It ended up meaning something different to what a lot of the people who voted on the issue thought it meant.  It is that kind of thing that causes difficulties on a practical level.  There is merit in having a degree of clarity so that it is clear that any pre-existing rights are governable by the Oireachtas and everybody knows where they stand but that is a matter for the committee as what exactly it wants to achieve and how it achieves it.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the amendment and other cases that have arisen that have nothing to do with abortion rights as such, it is true to say that the existence of the amendment has meant that other aspects of care for women have been captured within the remit of the amendment.  In particular, we saw the PP <i>v.<\/i>HSE case where a woman who was deceased and was pregnant was in circumstances where her body was being kept alive in order to keep the foetus alive.  In that case, the High Court held that this situation did engage the eighth amendment and that there was a right to life of the unborn in those circumstances - not one that had to be balanced against the right to life of the mother because the mother was deceased but a right to life.  The medical evidence in that case was unanimous to the effect that there was a high probability that the child would not survive until term; the fact that the mother had died at the point in the pregnancy, which was about 15 weeks at the date of her death, meant that the prospects for getting the foetus to a stage where it was viable was probably nil; and the mother's system was collapsing.  In other words, the clinicians who were involved could not apply ordinary principles of clinical practice to the circumstances in which they found themselves because they were very concerned that if they did so, they would be in breach of constitutional rights and possibly behaving unlawfully because their circumstances were unclear.<br\/><br\/>This is an aspect of the amendment that is not covered by the recent legislation, which simply covers how one balances the test in the X case or provides a mechanism for accessing an answer about whether or not somebody is entitled to an abortion in this jurisdiction.  It does not deal with the other issues that might arise.  Of course, the eighth amendment has also been used in other circumstances to suggest an unborn child has certain immigration rights that must be taken into account by the courts and that a frozen embryo has a right to life.  The Supreme Court held that a frozen embryo does not fall within the provisions of the amendment - least in the circumstances that pertained in the Roche case.  The eighth amendment was mentioned in the arguments in the MR &amp;amp; Anor <i>v. <\/i>An tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir &amp;amp; Ors case concerning surrogacy where the issue was whether the woman who bore the child was to be considered the legal mother of the child.  The terms of the eighth amendment were relied on to suggest that this is what that provision requires - again, not the basis upon which the court made its decision in MR &amp;amp; Anor <i>v. <\/i>An tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir &amp;amp; Ors.  The wording of the eighth amendment has had a lot of unexpected consequences and that is one of the difficulties about amending and replacing wording.  One must bear in mind that it can have consequences that may not have been intended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1506515400,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank all our experts for coming before us today.

It is certainly one possibility that those rights could essentially be recognised again or recognised to have continued in the aftermath of a simple repeal.

In that context, I cannot fault a word of what Dr. Kenny had to say.  It was a very accurate survey of the issues.  However, I would suggest that instead of talking about the \"risk\" of judicial intervention, one might talk about the \"possibility\" of such intervention.  Judicial intervention is very often what preserves us from chaos.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry to have to put it to Professor de Londras that she really ought to consider whether she has served the request of the Chairman well, in terms of seeking evidence and information without moving into the realm of opinion.  She appears to be constitutionally - if she will pardon the pun - incapable of using the correct term, which is \"unborn\".  I know that foetus, which is latin, means \"little one\" but very often it gets used in these debates so as to exclude consideration of one party, at least in terms of their humanity.  She spoke in various places about \"unduly complex and detailed\" constitutional provisions and about things being \"cumbersome\" and \"impractical\".  She also spoke about \"abortion care\" but there is very little care for the unborn in the process.  There is very little talk about pain killers and the late-term abortions that go on in places like Britain and Canada.<\/p> <p>  Professor de Londras also spoke about reproductive autonomy and even warned about the dangers of violations of international human rights law.  It always amazes me - all of the witnesses here are lawyers - how bodies such as the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, can tell us that we have a margin of appreciation in these areas, which in lay persons' terms means that where there is not a moral consensus, so to speak, countries can legislate according to their values and yet when I encountered the Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council of Europe, the hemicycle was told that we do not speak about human rights before birth.  I am wondering if that is the position of any of the people here.  Perhaps it is the position of Professor de Londras, seeing as she evoked the notion of violations of international human rights.  I am concerned and would ask her to consider whether she had not been very tendentious in circumstances where we were not to have advocacy here today; we were supposed to be getting informed opinion.    <\/p> <p>  I thank Ms O'Toole for her comments, much of which explained well the legal history in this area.  However, I note that she spoke about \"surprising outcomes\" in terms which seem to me to evoke a degree of criticism of the eighth amendment.  I would put it to her that there are other surprising outcomes.  She mentioned the C case and the terrible circumstances around that but I understand that is one of those areas where the person involved is on the record as saying that she did not come to believe that she was well served by the operation of the X case legislation.  Ms O'Toole also mentioned the D case, with which she was involved herself.  She would agree with me that Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns put it to her in that case that the issue had nothing to do with the abortion debate and as far as I recall, she agreed with him.  Is it not the case that no matter whether one had the eighth amendment or not, in any jurisdiction where there is a question about withdrawing life support, such a question could have arisen?  In talking about the surprising outcomes of law, could anything be as surprising as what the 1967 legislation in Britain turned into?  It was supposed to provide for abortion not being prosecuted in exceptional cases but it led to an abortion-on-demand situation.  Would it not be wrong to talk about this issue as though the only uncertainties could flow from constitutional delineation of matters when, in fact, legislation of any kind is equally prone to potentially surprising outcomes?  In terms of suggesting that any particular approach has merit, it is true that there were different views of what the eighth amendment might lead to but aside from the X case, it seems to have succeeded in its substantial aim, which was to reserve decisions about life and death in these matters to the Irish people and to exclude judicial and political elites from changing matters as they had often done, without public consultation, in many countries.  I would be interested to know if Ms O'Toole would accept the analysis that the eighth amendment was substantially successful in meeting the aim of its proponents and the 63% of people who voted for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#M00400","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1506515400,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Thank you Senator Mullen.

However, there would be limitation on that and the limitation would be the rights of pregnant persons.  This is, as the Senator will appreciate, the distinction between treating preservation of foetal life as a constitutional value and giving a right to life to the unborn.  It is more than, as the Senator knows, a technical distinction in terms of how the law would play out.<br\/><br\/>In respect of potential violations of international human rights law, I do not think I ever necessarily confined myself to saying that international human rights law might be developed only in order extend situations in which it might be seen that human rights protect a right to access abortion.  If we were to have a limited provision in the Constitution specifying grounds or an entrenched provision, let us say, and if international human rights law were to find that, in fact, unborn life did have human rights, we would once again find ourselves, I should think, in violation of international human rights law.  My point is simply that to put such provision into the Constitution prevents adaptation and, for the sake of a better word, legislative nimbleness or responsiveness when international legal obligations might change.  As the Senator will know, after Vo <i>v<\/i>. France and A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland, there is not yet a clear position in Strasbourg as to whether foetal life does enjoy convention rights but there is a clear view that where a national legal system provides for access to abortion, it must have in place a system that makes it truly accessible and makes the right operational.  Of course, as the Senator knows, I have a particular view on this relating to legal regulation that bears no relation to my personal, ethical view on abortion but I have been at pains in my submission to try to simply present the comparative legal position and the arguments, as asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Fiona de Londras"},{"type":"speech","time":1506515400,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank Professor de Londras.

I can comment only on what is on the public record.  If individual litigants have different views after cases, that is a matter for them.  What we are concerned with is how the courts actually deal with the rights in question and, when asked to make a judgment, what they take into account.  That is what I was dealing with in terms of both the C case and the P case. <\/p><p> When I refer to \"surprising outcomes of law,\" what I am talking about in that context is that during the course of the amendment campaign in 1983 a great number of people believed they would be voting to ensure there would be no abortion in Ireland.  A great many people would also have said during that debate that the amendment would not have had implications in any area other than in dealing with the issue of abortion.  When I talk about surprising outcomes, I mean it in that context.  I mean that one puts words in the Constitution and they have an impact in other areas with which one is not actually dealing in the context of the debate at the time of the referendum.  Nobody was talking about what would happen if the mother died or what would happen in respect of the unborn in the case of a pregnant woman in the asylum system.  Nobody addressed any of these issues; that was not what was at stake.  What was at stake was abortion law in Ireland.  We framed the amendment and the people voted on it in that way.<\/p><p> If I am asked whether the provision has been substantially successful, I imagine it depends entirely n one's view.  Suffice it to say members are all here to discuss whether the provision should be changed.  Presumably because there has been a sense that there is a view among the public that the wording should perhaps be changed, the extent to which it should be changed is a matter for members, as politicians, to discuss.

To some extent, many of my questions have been answered.  When one is the fourth questioner, things can get a bit messy; therefore, I ask for forgiveness if they do.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Professor Fiona de Londras.  Will she make us aware of whether any European constitutional court has dealt with similar issues concerning the unborn and access to abortion services?  If so, will she tell us how it has dealt with and resolved these issues?  I am considering the matter in the wider European context, considering that we are where I imagine others have been.<\/p> <p>  To return to the issue of repealing or replacing and bearing in mind the amount of documentation we have received, the main issue on my mind coming here today was that of the evidence of the Citizens' Assembly and the views of delegates, the experts, on repealing or replacing.  As I do not want to misquote anyone or condense some of the delegates' statements, making them open to misinterpretation, they should correct me if I am wrong.  What I am really taking from what is being said is that laying out explicitly the grounds on which somebody could access abortion services is pretty much unworkable.  To follow on from Deputy James Browne, it is very important that they hear the answers to these questions, including on the issue of rape which is a criminal act.  If we were to produce a list of reasons somebody might be deserving of the right to an abortion, or where we would deem her to be so deserving, what would be the position?  If somebody was raped, be it violent or otherwise, would it be pretty much impossible for a decision to be made?  Who would decide?<\/p> <p>  One of the delegates spoke about time sensitivity.  Serious issues arise about empowering people and taking power from people and putting it in the hands of somebody else.  All of the delegates have nearly answered that replacing the wording with a list of who was deserving would really not be workable.  Perhaps they might clarify the matter to ensure I am not misinterpreting them.<\/p> <p>  I was going to ask about the constitutional issue of exceptional circumstances, but I believe that question has been answered by Dr. Kenny.  Is there any country in Europe that has a list of reasons one can access an abortion service?  Who authorises abortions in these circumstances?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Dr. Kenny and it is about the idea of having legislation on abortion that would not be subject to constitutional challenge.  Am I correct in saying nearly any outcome could be subject to a constitutional challenge?  Are we saying that, no matter what the outcome of a referendum, someone could technically challenge it in court?  Am I misinterpreting the position?<\/p> <p>  Would anyone have concerns if we were to constitutionally preclude constitutional challenges to future legislation on abortion, or if we were to write in that no one could challenge a provision in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#N00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>The first issue was about laying out specific grounds.  I have expressed my view that it would be unworkable.  As I do not claim to have knowledge of every legal regime in the world, I state very tentatively my belief about countries that do lay out grounds.  I am aware of only a few.  Swaziland and Kenya are two.  They allow the Legislature to legislate on the matter; therefore, they have specific constitutional grounds, but there is t he possibility for the Legislature to set out others.  I shall make my next comment very tentatively as I do not claim to be an expert on the constitutional law of the places in question.  I believe Somalia has limited grounds, without an exclusion.  It is a necessity provision, but I do not know how it has worked in practice.  To my knowledge, I do not believe there is any European country that sets out specific grounds for access, but, again, I plead only partial knowledge on that question.  I am very happy to be corrected and Ms de Londras may know more than me.<\/p> <p>  The second question was about whether nearly any outcome would allow a constitutional challenge.  One of the points we have all been making is that we should perhaps never say never in this circumstance.  As my two colleagues said, certainty is unachievable.  One could get close to excluding the possibility of a challenge to legislation if one almost expressly stated the Judiciary shall not invalidate a Bill passed for this purpose by reason of constitutional rights.  That might exclude a great many possible challenges on the grounds that the regime was too liberal or too conservative.  Again, there is always a possibility that someone could find a way.  I never want to say \"never\", but that is the option that comes closest.  I do not believe it is quite as unachievable as the Deputy's comments suggested, but lots of options leave open the possibility.<\/p> <p>  On whether I am concerned about the prospect, it is ultimately for the people to decide in a referendum and their politicians in offering the referendum to them whether it is worthwhile.  One has to decide whether one believes the Judiciary should be intervening in this particular area and whether it would be better, for any reason, to have it decided with finality by the Legislature.  I do not have a concern about the idea that the people and politicians should get to decide.  That is the way our system works and the check on judicial power is ultimately that we can change the Constitution and, if we want, exclude things from the hands of judges.  As the check is with the politicians and the people, I do not have a reservation in that regard.  As to whether it would be appropriate in this case, I will leave it to other minds to decide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":463,"content":"<p>To pick up on the matter of other constitutions that specify grounds, my understanding is that Dr. Kenny is right; there are just the three countries he mentioned - Kenya, Somalia and Swaziland.<\/p><p>Somalia's is very limited.  It is a case of necessity, especially to save the life of the pregnant person, whereas in Kenya it is an emergency risk to life and a risk to health.  In Swaziland there is a longer list of serious risks to physical and mental health, including a serious risk that the child would - please accept this language as it is a quote - \"be irreparably seriously handicapped\".  In all cases one doctor certifies and, as far as I understand, no medical certification is required, but I do not know whose certification is required in cases involving rape, incest or unlawful sex with - again this is a direct quote - \"a mentally retarded woman\".  The Kenyan and Swaziland provisions, to the best of my knowledge, are relatively recent &ndash; within the last decade &ndash; and in neither case has legislation been passed to give effect to them; therefore, in both states, in fact, abortion services are largely inaccessible.  My understanding is the UN Population Fund and other organisations document extremely high levels of illegal abortions in these jurisdictions.<\/p><p> As regards other European states and constitutional courts, there are some courts that have dealt with similar issues.  It is perhaps particularly interesting to talk a little about the Slovak Republic because in that jurisdiction there is a recognition that prenatal life is worthy of protection, but there is no right to life.  The way the court has dealt with that issue is to state regulation of abortion is permissible but that one cannot disturb the essence of the rights women hold under the constitution.  That is not wholly dissimilar to something like the approach taken by the US Supreme Court that one cannot place undue burdens on women in accessing abortion services or proportionality.  There will be degrees of whether an essence is less or more than a proportionality approach, but that approach is relatively common.  It might be worth noting that the German constitutional court relatively early on in its jurisprudence on abortion did recognise a prenatal right to life, but it has progressively accepted that it does not preclude making abortion services available within certain schemata or certain limitations.  The constitutional courts of Austria, France, the Netherlands, the Slovak Republic and Portugal &ndash; the list may be longer, but that is my understanding of it - have all refused to recognise a prenatal right to life.  <\/p><p> Have I answered all of the questions asked?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Fiona de Londras","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506515400,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I believe so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#O00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1506515400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>We will move on as we are over time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#O00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":467,"content":"<p>My fellow speakers have outlined all of the various options in the context of repeal, replace and amend.  The point I am making is that putting in a long amendment may actually not be helpful because once it is interpreted, it is inclined to be fixed in a way that is very difficult to unfix if it causes any disquiet.  The benefit of legislation is that it can be amended much more easily than the Constitution, a change to which would require a referendum.<br\/><br\/>As to whether this should be an issue in respect of which the courts would have no input and no power to determine constitutional rights, as a lawyer I am somewhat uncomfortable with that, but that is just a personal view.  The main aim is to ensure everybody is clear, given the complications of the pre-1983 position and given the possible complications of deletion of the amendment <i>simpliciter <\/i>that one would arrive at a situation where one would make it clear that we were starting on a new page, as it were, and that rights would be defined in a particular way in legislation and that one was giving the Legislature the entitlement to do this.  Obviously, the Legislature would probably have to make it clear in advance of any referendum what legislation it had in mind.  Even that would not be completely simple, but what one would be trying to do is avoid the pitfalls because of the pre-1983 provisions.  Professor de Londras said in her paper that it might well be that if there was to be a deletion of the right to life of the unborn, one would arrive at a situation where although there was no right to life of the unborn, the right of the woman as a citizen to bodily integrity and so on would then come back to the fore again, but that would not necessarily preclude the possibility that the Legislature could limit that right in accordance with the common good, as has happened in other jurisdictions where there is no recognition.  The problem is that nobody can say for certain what is going to happen; therefore, what one needs to do is try to arrive at a position where one could be as certain as one could be of the result one wanted to achieve; the extent to which one wished to change the current situation and how one wanted to change it and what the pre-1983 provisions might do to that intention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1506515400,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O&rsquo;Toole.

The issue is the uncertainty about the conclusions it would come to.  It would obviously conclude that the eighth amendment was to be taken out of the Constitution so that the right to life of the unborn was not going to be an explicit constitutional right, and then there is the balancing right to life of the woman, except that the woman's rights to life and probably to bodily integrity would be part of the ordinary constitutional values.  What is unknown in that scenario is whether, notwithstanding that repeal, the court might take the view that there was still some residual unenumerated rights in regard to the unborn.  There are commentators who believe that is an unlikely outcome and those who believe it is impossible to call.

Because the people are sovereign, it would be the people's intention rather than the intention of any one body that is privileged because, obviously, there are many relevant comments made in this building and elsewhere that might lead up to it but it is the people's choice that has this sort of constitutional effect.  The problem is, of course, it is very hard to figure out the intent of the people at the best of times because the intent is often highly diffuse.  It is often not a single reason.  It is often many reasons.  Therefore, the courts have to look to all sorts of sources.  Sometimes, in cases where this becomes relevant, the court will say, \"Of course, the people did not mean\", and follow it with something.  It is difficult sometimes to know exactly where that comes from because there is no one privileged place where one can find the people's intention.  Even though that is all relevant and the other processes are taken into account as well in forming the context of the people's choice, there is no one privileged way one can say this is what the people intended.

Ms O'Toole's contribution, in particular, gave us a good insight into how the courts interpret these issues at present, which is critical for this because the repeal-replace discussion that we are having now really came in against the backdrop of the idea, introduced at the Citizens' Assembly by Mr. Brian Murray in his paper, that the courts might restrict the ability of the Oireachtas to legislate.  If you like, that was where the fear of the courts came from.  All of this uncertainty now is to do with how can we ensure the courts do not do that.  My first question is, are we in danger of over complicating matters here and taking it a little too far?  The courts have fairly well interpreted the provisions that have been there already.  I merely wish to hear the witnesses' opinion.  Dr. Kenny, in his paper, stated he did not think they would so interpret it.  In fact, Mr. Brian Murray himself stated he did not think it either.  Why are we spending so much time on it?  That is my first question.  The level of certainty we are seeking here is a Holy Grail.  It is not to be found.  We have a separation of powers in the State for a reason.<\/p><p>Is it not the case that prior to the eighth amendment, a sizable lobby in the State felt that the unborn did not have any rights even though abortion was outlawed under the Offences against the Person Act 1861 with the penalty of penal servitude for life?  Even though that legislated existed, to be sure to be sure there would never be abortion, this was inserted because it was believed the courts could have a Roe <i>v<\/i>. Wade situation.  Presumably, they did not think in 1983 that the unborn had a right.  I wonder are we overstating those implicit rights?<\/p><p>My other question was to Dr. Kenny, in terms of his point that the Judiciary now might interpret it but the courts in the future may interpret it differently.  I would put it to Dr. Kenny that a future Oireachtas could legislate, differently and in any way it likes.  If the Constitution states the Oireachtas has exclusive powers, then the Oireachtas can do whatever the hell it likes, basically, and that can be against the wishes of the people either way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#Q00600","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1506515400,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Does Professor de Londras want to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#Q00700","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I will address the first question.  First of all, Mr. Brian Murray is not the only person who noted that these possibilities are present.  I myself noted them in my written submission to the assembly.  The question is not necessarily whether we are over-complicating matters but rather what is the extent of what one might call the risk, likelihood, possibility or certainty we are willing to take on.  As I said, and we have all said, absolute certainty is not possible.  Ms Justice Laffoy said that last week as well.  The question for this committee, for the Cabinet and then for the people is how much we consider to be a reasonable level of certainty and that then goes to what ultimately one puts to the people, if anything.  It may seem overly technical and overly complicated but it is nevertheless not unimportant.  No matter what route we take, we will not be able to answer all the questions that we are mooting here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Fiona de Londras"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":494,"content":"<p>My view is that Mr. Brian Murray was just attempting to inform the citizens of what he believed, and I would agree, was a possible consequence of their action and trying to get across the idea that the courts could either liberalise or restrict access in a judicial determination in future.  I agree, as I stated in the paper, that is unlikely as I see it now.  The reason it may not be over-complicating but worth dwelling on is simply that judicial intervention in this area has caused such political consternation in, for example, the United States and to a lesser extent in Canada.  Judicial intervention in this area has caused significant political controversy and while we are on the topic of debating its future, it is worth bearing that in mind because the choice is open as to trying to control for judicial intervention or not, as the committee sees fit.<\/p> <p>  On the second question, Deputy Clare Daly is absolutely right.  Just as the future Judiciary can change, so too can the future Legislature.  I suppose the question is the extent to which we want to place the uncertainty with the courts or with the Legislature and its future composition.  Ultimately, almost any regime will require legislative action and will require a responsible Legislature to represent the people and act in a manner that is responsible in light of that.  Courts can only do so much and, ultimately, they cannot legislate.  There is not a way of avoiding relying on a responsible Legislature in future but, obviously, the choice lies with the committee as to where to place the uncertainty and the doubt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I would agree with the contributions made by my fellow speakers.

Similarly, at the time of the divorce referendum the wording was put to the people, then the divorce legislation was published and everybody understood what that would involve.

This is a matter for the committee, but it is a question of whether the populace will be happy that the politicians will enact something that they would like to see happen, whether it should be a matter for the Judiciary to decide where the rights lie or whether it should be some kind of compromise between the two and one just takes a leap of faith.

They were asked to give a range of opinions and people giving opinions is not banned in the committee.  In fact, we all had the option of recommending and suggesting people to give their opinions.<\/p> <p>  My questions relate to what was the intent of the Citizens' Assembly because that is why we are here.  Obviously, the committee is to deal with the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and the general issue of the reality of abortion.<\/p><p>It was mentioned earlier that the option is repeal or replace, but there is a third option which arises from the Citizens' Assembly, which is repeal and replace.  To make it clear the Citizens' Assembly was proposing that the eighth amendment should be repealed and taken out of the Constitution and replaced in order to try to copperfasten the right of Oireachtas to legislate.  That is what the Citizens' Assembly decided.  In doing so it was trying to close off any potential legal challenge and uncertainty as the witnesses have outlined because of the perceived pre-1983 rights.  It was being done from the point of view of an anti-abortion challenge.  That is clearly the case because it coincides with what it recommended, which was abortion on socioeconomic grounds, abortion up to 12 weeks on request of the pregnant person, for health reasons and so on.<\/p><p> I want to ask the witnesses about a specific wording.  The Citizens' Assembly did not come up with a wording, but it was mooted that specific powers might be given to the Oireachtas.  I believe that would be problematic because no legislation should be immune from challenge by a concerned person, whose civil rights, for example, might be being impaired.  Any wording would need to take cognisance of that.<\/p><p> While there is merit, as Ms O'Toole said, in dealing with this question of a danger of pre-existing rights, we do not want it to be the case that any legislation would be just impervious to any woman, pregnant person or anybody challenging it.  I think there would be a problem with that wording and I have no doubt that any referendum proposing that politicians would have exclusive power in anything would be roundly rejected by the electorate.  It shows the problems with inserting a wording.  Professor de Londras has suggested a wording, which does not give the Oireachtas exclusive powers, it just stipulates that the Oireachtas must legislate.  If nothing is inserted, as she suggested, how big a deal is the threat other speakers have mentioned?  The only threat I could envisage is a legal challenge.  However, if legislation was published as has been suggested so that everybody knew what they were voting for, would that not make it clear what the people's intent was?  I have heard people saying that there could be a chilling effect on the Oireachtas or that the Oireachtas might, if there was a legal challenge by an individual, try to use the vacuum of not having a replacement wording as a chilling effect and not actually legislate.<\/p><p> I want to ask about putting additional abortion grounds into the Constitution.  I am glad there has been some discussion of who our allies and friends are here.  Countries that are basically dictatorships or arise from dictatorships, such as Kenya, Swaziland, Chile and the Philippines, are the countries Ireland is in conjunction with on this issue.  While it may not be specifically for today, I believe Deputy Browne last week asked about a balance of power.  There might be a balance of power and a group of Deputies who put it up to the D&aacute;il to get the legislation changed or otherwise they would refuse to form a government.  There seemed to be a suggestion that some kind of special case or exemption from democracy would be made for abortion legislation - maybe a higher proof that the D&aacute;il would vote by, say, 72 to 25.  I am raising it because it is the second time I have heard it raised at this committee.  For the D&aacute;il not to be allowed to change legislation would be a break with our democratic rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#Q01400","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506515400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>We need to allow the questions to be answered because the Deputy has taken up a lot of the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#R00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>The negative provision that I propose would mean that the Oireachtas may legislate.

Whether it would do that or for how long that would pertain is a matter for these Houses and for politics.<\/p> <p>  There are two points on the balance of power and supermajorities which are related.  Even if, as Deputy Browne has suggested, there were some kind of coalition discussion where a red line on abortion legislation were proposed, the basic democratic safeguard of removability would always exist.  Therefore, if the people did not like it, they would not return those people in the following election.  Applying a supermajority would depend on whether the Members of these Houses consider this to be a topic that is in some ways so exceptional that it cannot be dealt with through the ordinary legislative process and that it is somehow different from other decisions that have implications for life and death that are taken every day on budgets, for example, in the Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Fiona de Londras"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I would be slow to parse the intent of the Citizens' Assembly in detail, but I will give my general sense of what it intended.  It seems to have been a dual intent, basing it on the transcript of the questions asked and the responses given.  It first wanted to take this issue out of the Constitution and then separately recommend particular legislative outcomes.  In the exchange I referred to earlier, the citizens were told that the Oireachtas when making decisions may be guided by the recommendations they subsequently make, but they would be giving it the power to decide for itself.  Obviously, there is the hope and anticipation the Oireachtas will follow the citizens' recommendations, but they did not make this choice in the expectation that the Oireachtas would absolutely be bound by them.  That is my reading of the assembly, but obviously it is open to interpretation.<\/p> <p>  On the politics or wisdom of immunisation to challenge, I will leave it to the members of the committee.  It is obviously a balance.  On the one hand the cost of exclusion is that it rules out a challenge by a concerned citizen affected in some way.  The benefits are that there is potentially less doubt, and less of a chill on the Oireachtas in that sense.  There would also be less risk in terms of a final settlement of the issue.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Ms O'Toole that it might be extremely helpful to have a published Act, as a kind of way of settling the intention with the people.  However, it is important to stress that it would not be absolutely definitive because the Act will not actually be part of the referendum.  It would be a promise or a pledge that might influence voters.  We cannot say that is what all voters intended or that it would be necessarily absolutely part of the decision.  By the same token, should the courts decide that that Act was relevant in informing the intent of people, it could end up limiting the power that was given by the referendum as well.  If it was taken that this was the intention of the people, it might form a limitation on future Oireachtas action itself.<\/p> <p>  I feel that we are just lawyers sitting here saying things are uncertain which, to a certain extent, is true but unfortunately that is the refrain I will continue to come back to.

The belief is that simply repealing the eighth amendment and not replacing it with anything will lead to abortion on demand because women will have their right to bodily integrity reinstated, that is, their right to health and their right to life, and that there will be no right to life for the unborn.  One side of the debate believes that would be the consequence of repealing the amendment without replacing it with any other provision.  The other side of the debate believes that repealing will leave the right to life of the unborn as an inherent right in the Constitution and will lead to a circumstance where a woman's right to bodily integrity would be trumped by that right to life.  Those are the two controversies.<br\/><br\/>We have had a lot of discussion over whether the pre-1983 position is correct or not.  My conclusion is that it is very difficult to say whether the pre-1983 position will re-emerge, certainly in so far as the rights of the unborn are concerned.  Professor de Londras said in her paper that if a woman's right to life and to bodily integrity were to come back to the fore, that there is no reason why the Legislature cannot modify those rights in the common good, just as they do with regard to other rights.  This, however, is not regarded by the other side of the debate as sufficiently secure for their purposes.  Again, there is a degree of uncertainty about exactly what would happen.  To my way of thinking, the Citizens' Assembly wanted to start with a clean slate and to ask how do we do this.  There are, of course, risks and benefits to each of those approaches.  How one sees those risks and benefits would also hugely depend on where one is standing.  It is the difficult task of this committee to look at that.<br\/><br\/>I think it very unlikely that abortion on demand would be the result of the repeal of the eighth amendment <i>simpliciter.  <\/i>The whole ethos of the manner in which we deal with these issues in Ireland makes that an unlikely outcome.  Certainly at present, however, an enormous deference is paid by the courts, as Dr. Kenny has said, to the views of the Legislature on how these rights should be balanced.  That is the present reality and the Supreme Court has reiterated as recently as the MR &amp;amp; Anor <i>v. <\/i>An tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir &amp;amp; Ors decision on the surrogacy issue that it is a matter for the Legislature to balance these precarious rights.  In the course of the X case Mr. Justice McCarthy complained that the Legislature has not introduced legislation as to how these rights are to be balanced and left it to the court.  No, then, I do not think that a repeal would lead to abortion on demand.  One is dealing, however, with the two views on each side as to what the consequences of repeal without replacement might be.  One is trying to balance all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1506515400,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Do the other two witnesses want to make a brief comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#S00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Very briefly.

Those of us who campaigned against it at the time, and I am glad to say that I was one of them, made the argument that the Constitution it was not the right place to insert something specific of that nature.  To bring this back a stage, this leads to the question as to how a constitution should operate.  Should it operate on the basis of broad principals or the basis of specifics?

The choice needs to be made in this House as to what the appropriate level of detail would be and if certain regulatory changes need to be made.

Studying the judgments of the courts now with hindsight, it seems in my view that was a very unlikely possibility at that point.  I certainly would not say that it was foreseeable.  Again, there is a never-say-never aspect to this and one can never know how the courts are going to develop.  As to whether or not there was an imminent risk at the time, however, I would say that it seems unlikely and it was probably not an immediate concern.  <br\/><br\/>The simplest legal definition of repeal would be that the language is excised and no longer there.

She was very clear on that.  Of course, the difficulty is what legal certainty is and when would one arrive at it.  The Constitution only states that the Oireachtas legislates and the courts interpret the intention of the Legislature.  Of course, in the this context the reason we have had interpretations is because we have had no legislation.  It was the X case which led to the interpretation of the Constitution and why we are in a particular bind in this context.<\/p><p> We may be complicating the issue in terms of the legal and constitutional aspects, such as, for example, publishing legislation with a repeal or amend provision and asking the people to adjudicate on the Constitution while at the same time assuming that legislation is published in tandem which ensures they can feel comfortable amending or repealing the amendment.  It may be the case that legislation would be published and run in tandem with a constitutional referendum and the people would decide to change the Constitution because they are comfortable with the legislation.  If the legislation is subsequently interpreted by the courts and deemed to be ineffective or not to interpret the original constitutional change, would the Legislature be very slow to change that legislation given that it ran in tandem with a constitutional amendment?  I ask for more clarity on that issue.<\/p><p> Deputy Daly referred to the fact we might be complicating matters.  We complicated this issue because we had an insertion, Article 40.3.3&deg;, in 1983 but the Oireachtas never legislated subsequently.  We had a vacuum for many years.  It was not until the Supreme Court ruling in the X case that Mr. Justice McCarthy pointed that out.  We failed to legislate thereafter.  We have had a lacuna in the law while the courts were, I imagine, based on what they said, begging for the Oireachtas to legislate.  The Oireachtas has not had a great record in this particular area.<\/p><p> From that point of view, if we are to ask the people to amend, replace or repeal on the basis that the Oireachtas may legislate, we need to bear in mind that our record to date has not been great.  Is it necessary for us to say that the Oireachtas must legislate but that can be interpreted by the courts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#S01300","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":520,"content":"<p>On whether the Legislature would be slow to depart from legislation published in tandem with a referendum proposal but not entrenched in the Constitution, the answer is likely to be \"yes\" because there would likely be a sense that this is what people understood themselves to be voting for.

Nevertheless, the ordinary processes of politics, such as protest, representation, changes in scientific knowledge, hard cases or whatever, would be processed by the Oireachtas in the ordinary way.

I am not sure that what we are doing will deal with those issues in their entirety because they still exist.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Daly, correctly, referred to the 1861 Act.  As one of the people who was in the House in 1983 and went through that debate, I can assure the Deputy that it was not a simple debate.  It was a very animated and bitter debate on both sides.  This is not a simple thing.  People who believe that what we are discussing is simple are naive.  The people on the Citizens' Assembly had the advantage of not having to address their constituents or the various groups which are likely to come to the fore in the course of what we are now undergoing.<\/p> <p>  It is worth saying at this stage that the 1861 Act did not protect women to any great extent.

The nearest thing it has to one is the European Convention on Human Rights which was enacted in law in 1998.  That gave it a charter against which to measure rights.

They have unwritten constitutional principles, which is somewhat different.  Invalidating legislation is a different day's work.  We recently saw the challenge to the constitutionality of the manner in which the Brexit legislation was brought before the British Parliament because it has unwritten parliamentary rules allowing it to ask whether there is the power to do this, that and the other but invalidating legislation is not one of those things.<\/p> <p>  In the Bourne case in England in, I think, 1937, a doctor was prosecuted under the Offences against the Person legislation that the Deputy speaks of for having performed an abortion on a 14 year old.  He said he was performing it to preserve the life of the mother.  The jury was directed to acquit him of the offence of abortion on the basis that if the mother's pregnancy had proceeded she would have been a mental and physical wreck.  That test imports health, as opposed to life, qualifications.  Following that case legislation regulating the abortion regime was introduced in England.  It is purely legislative and is amended by Parliament from time to time as required.  It is not subject to a constitutional analysis in that way.  It might be subject to some kind of challenge under the European Convention on Human Rights but it has not, in so far as I am aware, been so challenged to date because I do not think there is any provision of the convention that would obviously be breached by anything in the English legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092700002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary O'Toole"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506515400,"counter":534,"content":"<p>In terms of constitutional analogies the UK does not work very well as Ms O'Toole has said.

I am pleased to have an opportunity to provide the joint committee with an update on the mid-year review of my Department's Estimate for 2017.  We have provided a comprehensive briefing to Deputies and Senators giving detail of the Vote position to the end of July, a summary of health service expenditure by service area to the end of June, performance information by divisional area to the end of June, and details of the HSE's performance and accountability framework.<\/p> <p>  Last year, the health Vote did not technically require a Supplementary budget to cover deficits.  This was a direct result of the provision by the Government and Oireachtas of an additional &euro;500 million in funding for the health Vote to improve the baseline funding of health, as well as of management efforts to remain within budget.  The gross current budget for the health sector for 2017 is &euro;14.152 billion, which is an increase of &euro;457 million over the 2016 allocation.<\/p><p>The health Vote, as members will appreciate, has increased significantly in the past three years, reflecting our commitment to try to provide a health service that seeks to improve the health and well-being of our people.  The additional funding provided since 2015 has provided me with additional resources to try to invest in acute issues facing patients, such as winter initiatives, in addition to meeting commitments in the programme for Government.  However, there are still real fiscal challenges facing the health service and we must continue to focus on effective financial management to ensure that services are delivered in line with the national service plan and within budget.<\/p><p> Actual expenditure for the entire Vote for the first seven months of the year to the end of July is &euro;8.29 billion, against a budget profile of &euro;8.25 billion, suggesting an overspend in Vote terms of &euro;40 million.  The Department and non-HSE agency spending is below profile on current expenditure of &euro;27 million.  This largely relates to a timing issue on payments under the hepatitis C compensation tribunal and profiling issues relating to payments to directly funded agencies and is expected to reverse substantially by year end.  There is a positive variance of &euro;32 million on capital spending due to timing issues on the progress of a number of projects.  Expenditure is expected to progress steadily as construction now begins, and the 2017 capital allocation will all be spent.  Against these underspends the HSE subheads are &euro;100 million over profile.  There are a number of contributing factors to this overrun, including extra activity, costs relating to bringing forward the pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road agreement to April of this year, which were not profiled for and are as yet unfunded, and a higher level of settlements by the State Claims Agency than profiled.  Overall, based on the position to the end of July and known financial challenges, we anticipate a level of overspend by the HSE linked to the 2017 pay agreements, the State Claims Agency settlements and expenditure in a number of service areas being over budget.  The HSE, through its performance and evaluation framework, is undertaking action to reduce the level of this final potential overrun.  My Department and the HSE are operating and planning on the basis that additional funding will not be available for any overspend in delivering the commitments set out in the national service plan, and I differentiate there from the other areas.  However, we are discussing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the situation regarding the funding requirement arising from decisions made subsequent to the national service plan, particularly central wage agreements, and any overrun in settlements by the State Claims Agency.<\/p><p> In terms of performance of the health services so far in 2017, it is clear that there are areas of good performance within our health service where activity is on target, while challenges clearly remain in other areas.  The outpatient department waiting list action plan is focused on reducing the number of patients who would be waiting 15 months or more for outpatient appointments by the end of October 2017.  Since the beginning of February to the week ending Friday, 2 June, nearly 42,000 patients had come off the waiting list under this plan.  At the beginning of this month, almost 76,000 patients had come off the list.  The inpatient and day case waiting list action plan is being delivered through a combination of normal hospital planned activity as well as additional funded activity utilising the funding provided in budget 2017.  Between early February and the week ending 1 September, almost 21,000 patients had come off the list under this plan, and we will have seen in last month's published National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, figures a significant decrease of more than 2,000 in the total number of people waiting for a hospital operation or hospital procedure in this country, showing the work of the NTPF beginning to kick in.  While elective discharges in hospitals remain on target for 2017 and at the same level as 2016, day case discharges are up against the 2017 target and up on the same period last year.  Cancer screening services metrics are showing positive performance improvements.  For example, the national screening service for bowel cancer, BowelScreen, shows an increased client uptake, and the number of people completing the home test for bowel cancer is 19% ahead of expected activity, while the number of women having smear tests and mammograms through CervicalCheck and BreastCheck are also ahead of target.  While many challenges remain throughout the health system, there are some positive stories to relay where progress is being made on the ground through the hard work and dedication of many people working throughout our health services.<\/p><p> There are obviously service pressures being experienced, and these are seen particularly in our acute hospital sector and our disability services.  In the case of the hospital sector, this is substantially reflected in non-pay categories and comprises increased complexity of activity, non-achievement of savings targets and a shortfall in income, while the pressures in disability services largely arise as a result of regulatory compliance and emergency placements.  In the recently published mid-year expenditure report, the issue of health funding is highlighted as a major policy challenge, not just in this country but internationally.  Despite a welcome increase over recent years, a financial challenge remains as we continue to deal in this country with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements.  We also deal with increased demand for new and existing drugs - we have seen many examples this year whereby the Government made decisions regarding the provision of new drugs - and the rising cost of health technology.  I wish to flag to this committee, as I have done on previous occasions, that the cost of payments under the State Claims Agency is continuing to rise, increasing the cost of health above that necessary to meet the health demands of a growing and ageing population, which remains a challenge.  In fairness, this issue is outside the HSE's control; these decisions regarding how much compensation someone is paid or how much someone is paid through a claim are made in the courts.<\/p><p> Budget day is drawing closer and is of great interest not just to those in these Houses, but also to patients right across the country.  My Department is in regular contact and engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the increased costs and the additional health priorities in 2018.  Budget 2018 cannot just be about funding the health service as it currently is.  It must be about funding new developments and new reforming measures.  Many of the Members in this room sat on the Sl&aacute;intecare committee and I am struck by their own recommendations in this regard.  The discussions include the funding required to maintain the existing level of services, but also funding for priorities included in the programme for Government and funding to allow for the delivery of our capital programme in 2018.  These discussions are taking place in the context of the fiscal constraints, which everyone is well aware of, and we are particularly conscious of our desire to reach a balanced budget in 2018.<\/p><p> With regard to funding for new developments, I assure the committee that the priority areas will reflect the commitments outlined in the programme for Government, many of which are also highlighted in the Sl&aacute;intecare document.  There are 132 commitments in the programme for Government in respect of health, and many of these have a financial cost.  It will be necessary to prioritise and phase these initiatives carefully, conscious of the budgetary constraints within which we must operate.  I would genuinely welcome the input and views of this committee as to where it feels the priority areas should lie, particularly in the space of what we call new developments.<\/p><p> For capital, notwithstanding the challenges arising from the impact of inflation, we will see major initiatives such as the national children's hospital, the new mental health hospital in Portrane and a substantial number of more modest and necessary projects proceed across the country.  Many of these are already under way.  In addition, the HSE has developed an ambitious eHealth programme which, through the Department and the Office of the Chief Information Officer in the HSE, has built significant momentum and support, and we need to build on that further.<\/p><p> While we have secured a significant increase in funding for the health services for this year, I do not underestimate the challenges involved in the delivery of a safe, efficient health service for the people.  We must maintain our focus on improving the way services are organised and delivered and on reducing costs in order to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs.  In order for the Government to have the confidence to prioritise additional investment in our health services in 2018 and beyond, it is essential that those managing our health services and delivering the service demonstrate good practice by delivering the best possible health care within the limited resources that have been made available by Government each year.  The Taoiseach has made the point, which is worth re-emphasising, that we pump an awful lot of taxpayers' resources into our health service.  We need to grapple in these Houses and in Government with the question of how that money is spent and ensuring it is spent on the priorities we set in these Houses.  I genuinely believe the work done by many Members on Sl&aacute;intecare is extraordinarily helpful in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#B00600","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.

The horse has bolted.  These are the results of the first six months so it is a historical document.  It is something we are looking back on, and there is so much detail.  There are some positives but there is also some seriously worrying stuff in here regarding targets and, collectively, between the whole lot of us here, we will probably get through quite a few of them.  I will go through some priorities that I see and then ask some questions about future issues based on the information we have here.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the expenditure, we do not see anything about the children's hospital.  If there is something about it here, it is hidden.<\/p><p>Why is that?  Where is it coming from?  Where is the expenditure to date coming from?<br\/><br\/>I have some questions relating to the maternity strategy.  It is a strategy that we are all in favour of and I am hugely supportive of it.  I think it is an excellent document.  It is one of the best documents relating to the health area ever written in this country.  Again, however, we do not see where the supposed expenditure is and the key issue for me is that we are two years into the strategy but it is just not happening.  The soft stuff is happening and that is good, but anything that needs money is not happening.  I ask the Minister to address that point.<br\/><br\/>In terms of capital projects in general, what projects have been delayed?  Given the figures that have been produced here, it seems that there are capital projects that have been delayed.  I ask the Minister to outline where those projects are, what they are and why they are delayed.  We can see from the figures that there is an overspend in the acute area while there is an underspend in primary care.  We all, in both the Sl&aacute;intecare process involving the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare as well as in this committee, agree on one thing, namely, that primary care spending needs to go on an upward trajectory.  We need to see a re-balancing of the percentage spent on primary care <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>acute care.  It is still going in the wrong direction and is not being arrested.  We are talking here about expenditure to mid-year.  We have not even seen the winter.  If we are &euro;104 million over in acute care already, what are we going to be over by the end of the year?  Last year, the chief executive of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, wrote to all of the regional CEOs - he did not write to them himself but very controversial letters relating to performance were sent.  I have some sympathy for those CEOs in terms of how expenditure is being managed because, in some cases, they do not have full control over the levers.  Obviously there are demand-led services and a range of issues in terms of commitments given to them in the context of the capital plan that did not happen and so forth.  They still have legacy issues which result in expenditure that they cannot control.  If commitments are made in the community and primary care areas, for example, that are not honoured then expenditure in the acute hospital system is going to explode.  What will be the result of that?  <br\/><br\/>In terms of primary care centres, the difficulties have been going on for years.  We are way behind schedule as regards the roll out of new centres and there are lots of complications.  I have asked questions of the HSE regarding certain primary care centres and have not even received a response.  I will give the Minister a note on that.  I have asked the director general about one primary care project in particular on two or three occasions but I still have not received a response.  He delegated to his assistant, who did not came back to me.  How much of the spending on primary care centres is actually on new centres?  <br\/><br\/>In terms of the fair deal scheme, why is the expenditure so low?  It is way lower than expected.  There must be some evidence to explain why that is happening.  Given where we are going as a country, demographically, is the Minister surprised by this?  Is it related to other macro-economic factors?  Why is it happening?  <br\/><br\/>When it comes to the primary care setting, the figures indicate that approximately 30% fewer patients are being seen by nurses in the primary care setting.  We want more people to end up in primary care settings and we want more primary care centres.  We also need to ensure that those who have issues that can be dealt with by nurses are being seen by them.  However, we are seeing an actual reversal of this.  Why is that happening?  <br\/><br\/>Every single Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas has had issues with medical cards and the processing of same.  We now have a situation where the processing is under target by 64% and we are being told that there are staffing issues.  Seriously, what is going on here?  That just does not stand up to scrutiny.  This is a real issue for people, on a human level.<br\/><br\/>The Minister knows that I am quite passionate about the area of home help.  I firmly believe in home help.  I believe we need to develop a new attitude towards home help.  I understand the issues with regard to getting staff and training people for this area into the future is critical.  Keeping people in their homes means less expenditure on nursing homes and on acute services.  The domino effect here is a matter of common sense.  It is a win for patients, the public and families, as well as for the taxpayer.  The targets for home help hours are not being met.  This is an issue that I deal with all of the time, on a day-to-day basis.  Granted, there are issues related to finding staff.  What is being done in that regard?  However, there are bigger issues, including the number of people who are approved for large home care packages but who cannot get their quantum of hours, or anywhere near it.  If an elderly couple is granted 20 hours but only gets eight or ten hours, they are nearly happy.  That is completely unacceptable.<br\/><br\/>We have a whole profile here relating to acute hospital targets.  Frankly, we could go through this every three months on a continuous basis but at this stage it must be said that some of the targets are just not realistic.  They are being missed left, right and centre and in some instances, by some margin.  If one looks at prostate cancer under various metrics, for example, one must ask if we need to re-evaluate the targets.  I have an issue with regard to the targets.<br\/><br\/>The data on the ambulance service is jumping out at me.  There are numerous issues relating to the ambulance service and we have discussed them previously.  I have repeatedly asked the Minister about the roll out of intermediate vehicles and the recruitment of staff for same.  We have situations where we have different model hospitals that are integrated into a network but which are dependent on an ambulance system that simply cannot function to the level required, in the context of the network of hospitals and how they operate.  In the mid-west, for example, there are people who should be in Ennis or Nenagh but who cannot get transported there on time.  At the weekends, certain hospitals end up packed with people who should be out in the model 2 hospitals in Nenagh or Ennis.  They cannot get transport, even though there are beds available in those locations.  The Chairman, Dr. Harty, knows all about this issue.  It has been going on for years.  It is basic stuff.  The people do not even want to be in Limerick; they would rather be closer to home and there is no need for them to be there.  <br\/><br\/>My final few questions relate to risks and future funding.  When will the new winter initiative be announced?  How is the Minister going to profile it?  Where is he going to find the money for it, given that we are already well over budget?  <br\/><br\/>There is a very interesting court case going on in Ennis at the moment relating to St. Joseph's nursing home.  There are two State bodies involved, the HSE and HIQA.  They are basically going at one another in relation to the accreditation of the nursing home.  I have serious concerns about how this is being conducted.  I am concerned about the role of HIQA and about how information about the home has been put into the public arena.  In fairness, the HSE is not being treated well here but that is not the real issue.  The real issue is that if this case goes in a certain direction, we could end up with a domino effect across nursing homes in this country which will result in serious damage to public confidence and increased expenditure.  Is this being profiled for?  This is a case that must be settled by the second week in December.  What is the thinking in relation to it?<\/p><p> As the Minister is aware, we speak a good deal in this committee about orphan drugs.  In fairness to my colleagues, we have spoken about the nine drugs we believe need to be brought through the process and made available to the patients who badly need them.  I refer to Entresto and eight others.  A very embarrassing situation arose regarding the accreditation of those drugs passing forwards and backwards between the Department to the Health Service Executive, HSE.  It was embarrassing for all of us, including the Minister.  I happened to be on the \"Today with Sean O'Rourke\" show talking about that when a major statement came in stating that in July, the HSE would fund all nine drugs.  It is nearly October and we have not heard an iota about that since.  When will the funding be in place?  When will the patients be able to avail of them, as in this year, because the statement clearly indicated they would be available this year?  Also, where will the funding come from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#C00500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.

That may be pushing it, but it sounds good.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I have a few questions, although Deputy Kelly covered some of the questions I was going to ask.  I find it difficult to understand the reason the number of home help hours and those receiving home care packages is down when my office is inundated every day with people requesting a home help service.  That does not add up for me.  The Minister might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  My baby is the issue of disability.  Every Department would like a bigger spend in the area of disability but I highlight for the Minister the huge waiting lists, not only for a diagnosis but for follow-on treatment.  That is particularly important for young people with early intervention being so important.<\/p> <p>  I would like the Minister to comment on what he is spending on advice and prevention in terms of trying to encourage people to eat healthier and exercise.  That would result in less of a spend in time to come because it might prevent people developing diabetes and other diseases.<\/p> <p>  On the winter initiative, last year was a bit of a learning curve but has the Minister other plans in place to make it work better this year?

While it is a historical document there are things we can glean from it that may assist us in the months and years ahead in terms of learning from the challenges we face and even the mistakes made from time to time.<\/p> <p>  A few issues arise, some of which were brought to my attention in advance of this document.  The child and adolescent mental health services across the country are under huge pressure and stress from the point of view of recruitment and the lack of psychologists and psychiatrists in the service.  That a huge number of children are still being admitted to the mental health services, not into adolescent units but into adult wards, which has been condemned and deemed wholly unacceptable from a clinical and a human rights point of view, is an issue of grave concern.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the child and adolescent mental health services in Cork, from what I can gather, and I would like the Minister to check this out and address it in a meaningful way, we do not have a permanent clinical governance structure in place in terms of personnel; we have the structure but not the personnel.  We do not have a clinical nursing director.  The assistant nursing director, which is a level 2 position, is acting in a level 3 position under that.  We have no permanent clinical governance structure in the child and adolescent mental health services in the Cork area.  That issue was brought to my attention recently by union representatives who are very concerned about it.  While I do not expect the Minister to comment now I would like him to revert to me on it.  Otherwise, I will have to raise it in the D&aacute;il.  It is an issue of huge concern across the country.<\/p> <p>  We always talk about the inability to recruit psychologists and psychiatrists and that being the main problem, but when I look at the HSE recruitment levels, and I put down some parliamentary questions on that previously, I see that there does not seem to be a ceiling or block in terms of recruitment on the administrative side.  That figure has increased from 1,075 last year to 1,159 this year.  The Minister will say that the HSE is expanding and so on but we seem to be incapable of recruiting clinicians across all specialties while at the same time the HSE is recruiting up to three managers a week.  We would want to reprioritise, while resources are scarce, and ensure that efforts are made to recruit those who will work on the front line and try to make the management system lean as opposed to bloated.  I urge the Minister to look at that.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to two issues I wanted to raise.  On the children's hospital, the legislation to amalgamate the three hospitals is coming forward.  Where is the template for the construction of the hospital both in terms of the timeframe but also the funding to underpin it?  Will a multi-annual budget be in place in the capital spend for the hospital or will it be very much on an annualised stop-start basis?  The Minister might give us clarity in terms of what he envisages with regard to that issue.  It is a huge undertaking.  Concerns were expressed previously about construction inflation and the cost of the hospital itself but does the Minister anticipate there being a multi-annualised, ring-fenced budget in place so that it can be built in a planned phase as opposed to depending on resources being made available more or less out of current expenditure?<\/p> <p>  Home help hours were referred to by Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony.  Sometimes I think we live in a parallel universe in terms of what we read in official reports and what we experience in our constituency offices.  Not a day or a week goes by that we are not hounding people trying to get a half hour of home help care here and there.  We now have a deficit of 5.4% in the number of people in receipt of home help hours; it has gone from 49,000 down to 46,339.  That is extraordinary when I, along with every other Deputy in this House, are consistently looking for home help hours.<\/p> <p>  That leads me to the issue of primary care.  Admittedly, the budget is down by only a small amount - &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million - in the overall spend of approximately &euro;1 billion but is the HSE serious about trying to ensure we bolster primary care services and lighten the pressure on our acute hospital system?  There is an overspend in our acute hospital system of approximately &euro;107 million and there is an underspend in the primary care budget of &euro;7 million.  Everybody tells us, including the discussions on finalising the Sl&aacute;inte Care report, from speaking to people at the coalface, primary care strategies, and all political parties are in agreement, that if we front-load spending in primary care and health and well-being, we should at least reduce the pressures on our emergency and acute hospital system over a period of time.  However, we seem to be incapable of planning our primary care system in a meaningful manner.<\/p> <p>  Reference has been made to the roll out of our primary care centres, which is haphazard.  While the building may be there, there is very little activity within.  The entire primary care system seems to be an afterthought when it comes to funding.  I can understand that the hospitals suck resources.<\/p><p>If we are to be serious, however, we must ensure that primary care investment is at least on profile and that we are spending as anticipated, as opposed to spending less and transferring that to the acute hospital system.<\/p><p> The maternity strategy has been mentioned and I will await the reply on that.<\/p><p> This morning, Patricia Flynn, spoke on the \"Morning Ireland\" programme.  Scoliosis is an issue that I and many other Deputies have raised in the D&aacute;il.  Many people are campaigning in respect of it.  Scoliosis was also raised on Leaders' Questions yesterday.  I realise that the Minister has as much interest in this as every other Deputy and that he feels for people whose procedures are delayed.  However, Ian Flynn was born with spina bifida and later developed scoliosis.  He has been waiting over a year for surgery.  Patricia Flynn spoke on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning so I am not divulging anything that is not already public knowledge.  Ian is twisting in his wheelchair.  His upper spinal curvature is now 68% whereas it had been 40% last year, while his lower spinal curvature is 78% having been 62% last year.  His scoliosis has progressed enormously in 12 months.  Initially, the family was told that his surgery would take place in the summer or the early autumn.  His mother has made contact with his surgeons on numerous occasions and been told that they are aware of Ian's condition but that they have no date yet for the surgery.<\/p><p> I accept that the Minister has spoken about this in the D&aacute;il in reply to Deputies, including myself, and explained that the theatre in Crumlin hospital, where there had been difficulties with recruitment, has been opened.  However, surely it is not beyond the ability of the State to prioritise surgeries in a way whereby we do not have to listen to mothers of children with scoliosis almost begging on national fora for their children to be dealt with in a meaningful, humane manner?  I urge the Minister to do everything in his power in this regard.  He has explained that the National Treatment Purchase Fund is in place and that this is increasing the number of surgical interventions, but the waiting lists are still increasing.  More people are on the waiting list now than there were last year.  If the Minister can do one thing in the next few weeks, he should refocus and prioritise the resource allocation for scoliosis.  If he has to front-load for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, he should do so, even if it requires bringing in paediatric and orthopaedic surgeons from outside the State rather than taking patients out of the State.  That should be done because this issue is a blight on the health services.  It is certainly a blight on the future of many children.  I urge the Minister to do that if he can.  I accept that he is as compassionate as the next person on this but it is no longer about compassion.  It is about action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#E00300","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I invite the Minister and his officials to address those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#F00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising a wide range of issues.  I will begin by thanking Deputy Kelly and, indeed, the members of this committee for the leadership they have shown on the HPV vaccine.  It is important that we speak with one voice in respect of this matter.  Adults in this country are dying needlessly of cervical cancer.  Every year, approximately 300 women will contract cervical cancer and, sadly, almost 100 of them will die.  We have a vaccine that can prevent that cancer and there is no room for any ambiguity or confusion on this issue.  Deputy Kelly has publicly expressed an interest in extending this vaccination to boys and I acknowledge his interest in that.  HIQA is currently undertaking a health technology assessment in that regard and I will not be found wanting in acting upon it.  We can keep in contact about that.<\/p> <p>  The revenue budget for the children's hospital is included as part of the Children's hospital group budget.  I can get the Deputy a detailed note on that under the acute heading in the document.  Obviously, it is a substantial part of our capital plan.  Deputy Kelleher also sought information on this.  It is a multi-annual capital plan.  The Government took a decision - in advance of the ten-year capital plan and the announcement of the capital envelopes for the next number of years on budget day - to prioritise this project.  That is why it has commenced.  There is a substantial taxpayer commitment to this in the context of multi-annual funding.  I will be happy to provide the committee with a detailed note on how that will be profiled over the next number of years.<\/p> <p>  I will launch the implementation plan for the maternity strategy in the next couple of weeks .  Deputy Kelly is correct that it is a superb document, but a document is only as good as its implementation.  I believe it was Eisenhower who said that the plan is nothing and that planning is everything.  We have a very good plan so we must put it into action.  Work is already under way in that regard.  We increased the budget for maternity services this year with the provision of an additional &euro;6.8 million.  That was up from an additional &euro;3 million provided in 2016 to allow the strategy to progress.  However, we will publish a detailed implementation plan in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  With regard to capital projects, the national children's hospital started later than had been wished so that largely accounts for the underspend in capital.  However, it is expected that it will have been rectified within this year.

When the former Deputy Rory O'Hanlon was Minister for Health at the end of the 1980s, he spoke about the importance of making a decisive shift to primary care.  Every Minister for Health since then has done his or her bit to help with that, but we must get serious about it now.  I do not believe we can make the substantial progress that is needed without the new GP contract.  I expect to have significant progress on that by the end of this year.  Hopefully, this will enable us, subject to normal budgetary constraints, to roll out a number of developments in 2018, 2019 and beyond that would see services which are currently provided in the acute hospital setting being provided in a primary care setting.  There is no disputing the fact of the underspend, although Deputy Kelleher acknowledged that it is very small as a percentage of the primary care budget.  There have been some delays, particularly in respect of the recruitment of staff.  We are all aware of that from our constituency work as well as our work in the D&aacute;il.  We are hearing that is improving and we are expecting that the primary care budget will be spent in full this year.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the primary care centres and the lack of response afforded to Deputy Kelly, that is not appropriate.

There were extraordinarily long waiting periods.  When the Deputy's party was in government with ourselves - happy days - the waiting times relating to the fair deal scheme reduced to four weeks or, in some cases, less.  We have maintained that.  Fair deal funding is being provided now in four weeks or less.  We expect that most of that budget will be consumed in the current year but, so far, there has been a lower volume than we had expected.  I prefer to err on the side of caution in terms of over-providing in this area because we are aware of the difficulties we can encounter when there are waiting periods of ten to 12 weeks.  At one time they were up to 16 weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#F00900","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I wonder if there are greater economic reasons for that or if there are other external factors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#F01000","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":576,"content":"<p>We are all aware of people in the community telling us that they find the fair deal scheme does not work for them, be it a farmer, small business owner or people who might wish to rent or sell their house and wish to be able to keep a greater proportion of the proceeds.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is reviewing a number of those issues.  That might expand the pool of people who might find the fair deal scheme more appealing than is the case currently.<\/p> <p>  On medical cards, the Deputy is correct that there had been a staffing problem.  I am assured by the PCRS section that this is now resolved and that there will be a significant improvement in the turnaround times in the next published figures, which are due shortly.<\/p> <p>  The Deputies referred to home help.  I have a couple of comments on that.  In certain CHO areas there is a capacity issue regarding the availability of home care staff.  That will not be a surprise to anybody.<\/p><p>In some parts of the country we do not have that problem while in others there is a very significant challenge in that regard.  In such cases, the HSE and local CHOs try to utilise the home care package scheme to enable a person to remain at home or return home.  While many have quoted figures pertaining to home help hours, those needs to be considered in the context of the home care package figures.  The number of intensive home care packages is 22.1% ahead of target and the number of general or more regular home care packages is 9.9% ahead of target.  The statistics tally with anecdotal evidence of CHOs utilising home care packages more and more when home help hours are not available.  Many in attendance, such as Deputy Kelly, have spoken in favour of a statutory home care scheme.  Deputies Kelleher and Murphy O'Mahony's party colleague put forward a Bill in relation to a version of the fair deal scheme for home care.  Everybody was inspired to do more on that issue by Brendan Courtney's very telling documentary that highlighted the situation faced by many families.  The Government is committed to introducing a statutory home care scheme.  All members want people to be able to stay at home in their community and grow old with dignity in the place he or she is from but the nursing home support scheme or fair deal scheme is the only statutory scheme.  The home help scheme does not exist in statute but, rather, it is <i>ad hoc<\/i>and not consistent in different parts of the country.  As members know, it is not easy to make it a statutory scheme.  Consultation is due to close in early October and we will be able to begin to outline the scheme in 2018.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Kelly has identified a fair point on targets.  They need to be re-evaluated and that is being done in the context of the preparation of the national service plan and budget 2018.  There is a careful line to be drawn between not removing the responsibility to reach targets from hospital managers and stress testing the targets to ensure they are realistic.  Managers make a difference and good management makes a big difference.  Figures published by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, rather than the HSE for patients on hospital trolleys over the period January to July of this year show that Beaumont Hospital had its lowest number of people on trolleys since the counting of trolleys began in 2006, as did Connolly, Cavan Monaghan and Mayo hospitals while St. Vincent's University Hospital, one of the large hospitals in Dublin, has its second lowest number since 2006.  Were Deputy Kelly to pre-empt what I might say next as being that one can also identify record highs in those figures, he would be correct.  However, there are capacity and staffing issues in all hospitals in the State, yet some are making far more significant progress than others.  I do not accept the idea I sometimes hear from certain elements that all hospital managers are the same and everybody is doing an excellent job.  It is clear that some are doing a far better job than others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#F01100","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I have no problem with that but it is not comparing apples with apples and oranges with oranges because if one considers the mid-west area, a brand new three and a half time capacity emergency department was opened but the volume of people going to it went up by 40%.

A bottom-up approach is being taken.  There have been too many winter initiatives, possibly including what I implemented last year, where Dublin has been central to decisions on what will be done for the winter and all other areas had to get on board with that and the message was passed down to local hospitals.  As the Deputy eloquently pointed out, there are different challenges in different hospitals so this year every hospital in the hospital group structure has been asked what would be of most help to them if additional resources were to be made available.  Interestingly, very different replies were received.  Some requested extra discharge co-ordinators because the hospitals do not have the capacity to discharge enough patients, in particular over weekends.  Others have raised issues such as longer opening hours for in-hospital diagnostic services.  One requested an additional porter to help people get to and from diagnostic services more quickly in order to facilitate a quicker patient turnaround.  The issues of additional beds and home care packages are being considered.  We will be unveiling the measures shortly.

On Topical Issue debates, I am constantly asked if I am going to make this or that drug available.  This is despite the fact that the D&aacute;il passed legislation in 2013 which gave all control in this area to the HSE.  If people feel that the current system is broken, I would like to hear their views on what should replace it.  I think it is broken too.  Coming up with a better model is the conundrum.<\/p> <p>  On those specific nine drugs, the HSE informed my Department in July that it wished to make those drugs available to patients.  Only the HSE can make the decision but it is supposed to inform and consult the Department if it is concerned that it cannot provide the necessary funding.  Agreement was reached that the funding would be made available from within the PCRS budget, which has been showing a surplus this year.  The cost for 2017 is quite minimal for these nine drugs.  That decision was made and the funding is in place.  I want to be crystal clear on that.  The drugs are expected to be available to patients from 1 November.  I understand that the target in the intervening period is to deal with matters such as prescription pathways, normal contractual arrangements, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#H00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I presume the Minister knew that this question would be asked in some shape or form.  I agree that the system is broken.  What happened in the context of provision and of arriving at this point was a joke; it was farcical and embarrassing.  It was embarrassing for the Minister and for us, as politicians.  The process by means of which these drugs are accredited was also embarrassing.  I refer to the need to go from Billy to Jack and then back to the Department, which was just laughable.  The letters that were written in respect of this issue are laughable.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Minister that the issue must be addressed.  We can work with him on it.  Unfortunately, or fortunately, the process to which I refer is in place and will be until we, collectively, take action to change it.  The issue is that a commitment was given in July, basically on foot of media and political pressure.  Everyone knows that these drugs are a necessity, and, based on the cost, they have already been approved.  One of the drugs is absolutely essential and cost-neutral in nature.  As far as I am concerned, the announcement in July was a false announcement.  Today is the first time that I have heard the date of 1 November mentioned.  The announcement was made, to great fanfare, in July.  I was discussing this issue live on \"Today with Sean O'Rourke\" when the statement announcing that this matter was going to be dealt with was issued.  That has happened.  What happened in the remaining weeks of July and in August, September and October?  The announcement was made but, from a profiling point of view, there was no intention of providing funding until the last month or two of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#H00600","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I agree that the entire process was extraordinarily unedifying.

I can reassure the Deputy that this is not the cause of the delay and that there is adequate funding this year, from the relevant date in July onwards, to fund those drugs.  The process has taken too long.  I do not want to talk about individual cases - I am sure the Deputy does not wish to do so either - but there are a couple of cases that are sensitive and time-sensitive in nature.

I do not believe that there is any perfect system in the world for this.  I meet EU counterparts quite regularly to discuss this issue because many countries are grappling with it.  The current situation, whereby the Minister for Health ultimately ends up in front of Parliament asking \"Where is this drug?\" is not the most efficient way for patients to access them.<\/p> <p>  In advance of all parties preparing their pre-budget submissions, I make the point that the cost of providing new drugs in 2017 is something of which we must be conscious.

We often discuss what to do when someone gets sick but we very rarely talk about what we are going to do to keep them well.  I will be launching the Healthy Ireland fund in the coming days.  By means of this, bodies will be able to draw down funding if they want to do something to help make the nation more healthy.  The latter is not just the job of the Department of Health.  There are a variety of ways in which we all have a role to play in tackling obesity.  In recent days, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and I launched new nutritional guidelines for school meals.  A strange situation existed until now whereby the Department of Health said, \"Here are the nutritional guidelines that our children should be following\", and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was funding school meals in DEIS schools, but there was no stipulation in the service level agreements to say that the school meals had to comply with the guidelines.  All of the service level agreements will be in place by the new year - some are already in place - and this will mean that we will only fund what is in line with the nutritional guidelines.  This includes things such as fried food only once a week, only water and milk served with meals, not allowing items that are high in fat, sugar or salt content to be added to cereal and porridge, and greater availability of fruit and vegetables with all meals.  Those are some of things we are doing.  This is active schools week whereby the Department of Education and Skills is encouraging all children to get active.  There is a huge body of work that has to be done across Government.<\/p> <p>  I know that Deputy Murphy O'Mahony and Senator Dolan are very interested in the area of disability.  One of the issues about which my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I are most concerned relates to emergency placements.  We are seeing a very high number of children and young adults with very complex needs who, for their own well-being and for that of their families, require emergency care.  I do not want to put a cost on it but I will say that these places are extraordinarily expensive.  That is the reality with which we must deal in the context of budgets.  We must ensure that staff are trained and that appropriate facilities are available, and there must be liaison with HIQA so that emergency placements can be made quickly.  This matter is a priority for the Minister of State, who is also working on the task force on personalised budgets, and myself.  We spend a decent percentage on disability services.  When one meets people with disabilities, however, they do not feel that the funding gets anywhere near them.  The task force is due to complete its work by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  I have outlined the plan for the winter initiative this year in terms of a bottom-up approach and asking individual hospitals what they want.<\/p> <p>  I will revert to the Deputy Kelleher on the issue of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Cork and his assertion that there may be a lack of a permanent clinical governance structure.  I will establish the facts and revert to the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  Deputies should be careful when referring to numbers of managers because it creates an impression that everybody is sitting around pushing papers and writing letters.  When one talks about managers in the HSE, one often means managers and administrators.  That may be the person who answers the telephone when a patient is trying to make an appointment.  It may be someone working on a public health agenda.  It may be a new clinical programme for cancer.  I want to see fewer managers in the health service.  Sl&aacute;intecare does too.  I want to see an amalgamation or closer alignment of our CHOs with our hospital groups, but we do need to keep a sense of perspective on that.<\/p> <p>  I have answered Deputy Kelleher's question about the national children's hospital and about primary care.<\/p> <p>  I want to be very clear on the issue of scoliosis.  I have not, in my time as Minister for Health, ever seen the HSE more focused on resolving an issue.<\/p><p>We got there as a country because we were shamed into taking action.  The waiting lists for scoliosis have been unacceptably high for children, not just this year but in Celtic tiger times.  We have put in an additional &euro;10 million and have hired additional consultants and theatre nurses.  More surgeries will be done in Crumlin and Temple Street this year combined than were done in the entire year last year.  I was talking to the children's hospital group CEO as recently as this morning.  We now have a situation whereby we can put in place a sustainable system which ensures every child will get their procedure within four months, which is best international practice and in line with the NHS.<\/p><p> The problem is that we have a very significant backlog.  In fairness, when the four-month target was announced by the director general of the HSE, it was clear that international outsourcing would be part of that.  We have had children go to Stanmore in the UK and have their surgeries very successfully.  We have signed service level agreements in Germany and with other hospitals in the UK.  I am very conscious that it will not be appropriate for every family.  However, I can say that absolutely everything that can be done is being done.  Deputy Louise O'Reilly will speak in a moment.  I am aware of her general concerns about the issue of outsourcing.  We want to arrive at a situation where we can provide a maximum waiting time of four months for all children with scoliosis in this country.  That is what we are genuinely working to do.  That is what the children's hospital group is working to do and is going to do.  We are serious about dealing with the backlog and therefore I do not apologise for offering parents an additional route which may be Stanmore or Germany, in circumstances where it may suit.  It is not ideal for everybody but we are trying to go with this in every way we possibly can.  We want to see the theatre open five days a week.  It will require the recruitment of an additional two consultant surgeons but we are entirely committed to that.  The theatre is operating at full capacity with all of the resources that it currently has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#H00900","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I am under pressure for time so will try to be as quick as I can.  I apologise if I cannot wait for the reply; I will catch up on the transcript and will stay for as long as I can.<\/p> <p>  I might be able to help with regard to the difficulty in recruiting home help staff.  As the Minister will know already, I represented home help staff for long years.  They are a fantastic bunch, mostly women, and we do not have enough of them.  Clearly if we made their work a more attractive area we would see an uptake.  They were the only group not subject to the moratorium and their employment would have remained relatively constant, were it not for the fact that the hours kept being cut back.<\/p> <p>  According to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, the average cost of providing an hour of home help is &euro;23.20.  For not-for-profit or directly employed home helps, we are talking about a considerable reduction on that rate.  My information is that it is somewhere around &euro;17 per hour.  We are already looking at a considerable saving.  The figure of &euro;23.20 is arrived at because there is a huge amount of outsourcing to what are effectively massive global multinational corporations.  I understand that there was some dispute in the courts and I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee before she was appointed to a different role.<\/p> <p>  It strikes me that if the Minister wants to increase the uptake in the number of home help staff, he should focus on those areas where employment is that bit more attractive, namely, in the smaller agencies.  Effectively, the smaller agencies have been frozen out by the tendering and the other competitive processes, in which they cannot compete because their margins are extremely low.  All of the money that they get goes directly into the provision of home help services.  For the smaller not-for-profit agencies to thrive, they are going to need the HSE to give them a hand.  It would be beneficial for people who need home help services, for the home helps themselves and, indeed, for the small providers if some direction could be given from the level of the Department of Health in that regard because it is a case of survival of the fittest.  The people who are going to suffer are the smaller agencies.<\/p> <p>  I firmly believe that the directly employed home help staff and smaller agencies actually provide much better value for money.  I do not think anyone would dispute that.  There are big players in this, multinational corporations that are in the business of making hundreds of millions in profits.  There should be a greater focus on the smaller operators whose margins are tight.  That would, in turn, improve the take-up of people who are willing to go into that type of work.  What they need is stability.  I spent years in and out of the Labour Court trying to come up with a contract that would provide them with some level of stability.  Clearly, if the demand is there - and it is - stability and continuity of employment should be sustainable.  There is not a Deputy in the House who has not had people through their door looking for more home help hours.  The example was given of a couple with an entitlement to 20 hours who are lucky if they actually get eight, nine or ten hours.  The demand is there.  The capacity exists for the Government to give the staff more sustainable contracts of employment.  It has long been a mystery to me as to why that will not happen.<\/p> <p>  If I may refer briefly to the hospital waiting list figures and the emerging practice of publishing them at 6 p.m. on a Friday, 8 September was the last time it was done.

The Minister's colleague who was responsible for the housing figures got caught on this a number of times and now those figures are published.  I have written to the Minister on this matter on more than one occasion. We all know what kind of news gets published at 6 p.m. on a Friday and it is not good news.<\/p> <p>  Many of the questions I had have been asked.  There is a section in the document for the National Advisory Council on Drugs but there is no money put beside it.  That jumped out at me.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to explain what that is.<\/p> <p>  The maternity strategy has been mentioned already.  I would like to mention the baby friendly health initiative, which closed yesterday.  Part of a maternity strategy, albeit a small enough part, is to encourage mothers to breastfeed.  It would strike me as a bit counter-intuitive to cut the funding to this initiative, which I think was geared towards encouraging mothers to breast feed.  Our breastfeeding rates are atrocious.  They really are.  It is hard in the maternity hospitals to find the space and time to sit, particularly with new mothers, to give the encouragement that is necessary.  A cultural change is needed.  If we are all agreed that the low breast feeding rates are something that we need to address, it strikes me as somewhat counter-intuitive to have closed the initiative.  The Minister might be able to explain why that happened or if there is going to be something there to replace it.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Tony O'Brien has said on a number of occasions that the HSE does not have the capital budget necessary to build major infrastructure projects.  I am thinking in my own constituency of the new forensic hospital - it will not be called the central mental hospital any more - as well as the national children's hospital and the new maternity hospital.  If Mr. O'Brien on the one hand is saying that the shillings are not there, while on the other hand the Minister is saying they are definitely going to be built, there does seem to be a disconnect.  The Minister might explain why and how.<\/p> <p>  On the figures on primary care, I understand the Minister's staff will be tormented with questions on this issue.<\/p><p>It really stumps me that while money is being made available to build primary care centres like the one in Balbriggan and while I am sure it will soon have a big ribbon placed on it and someone attending with lots of photographers to open it, there are no new staff.  There is not one single extra body for Balbriggan.  I have put down questions on this for the past 15 months.  It is the same story with a lot of the primary care centres.  While there are new facilities, there are no new staff members.  If we are going to be serious about primary care, we will need to see some focus on the recruitment of staff.<\/p><p> I appreciate fully and accept the Minister's bona fides on scoliosis.  I know people are working hard to get this done, but that theatre should be open seven days a week.  There are 68 complex cases which are not suitable for outsourcing.  These are kids who cannot be taken abroad.  We will not get into the debate about outsourcing, but even if the wherewithal was there and the contracts were signed, there are 68 kids who cannot travel.  I am not a doctor, but my understanding is they can only be treated in Crumlin because of the level of their specialty.  They have all been waiting more than four months and I do not think the target will be met for them.  The parents deserve to know.  They are in the dark.  They hear on the news that the targets are going to be met, but they look at their kids and they have no date for their surgeries.  If the targets are not going to be met for those kids by the end of the year, hard and all as it is, the fair thing to do is to be honest with the parents, tell them it is not going to happen and provide them with a realistic date.  Certainly, we have all been contacted by people who are in that scenario.<\/p><p> Can we get a figure on home help hours?  While I see the global figure provided, can the Minister give the committee with a breakdown of the money spent on private, not-for-profit and directly-employed home help?  When I worked in the union, we engaged someone who was much better than me with figures to go through it.  That person came to the conclusion that the directly-employed and not-for-profits represented the best value for money, yet year-and-year until now, the spend has been going up on the for-profit global multinational corporations with their millions and billions in profit and top executive salaries.  That pushes the overall spend up.  While that is good news for the Government, which can say \"Look at us.  We are spending more money on home help\", no additional hours are being provided because it is just buying more expensive hours from global multinational corporations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#J00800","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Minister but I have a Commencement Matter in the Seanad on a health issue which I must go to.  However, I will come back once it is dealt with.  Respite care is a major problem.  I notice the number of people who have been able to get respite care has reduced drastically.  My understanding is that part of that has been the result of HIQA inspections on the basis of which facilities have been deemed unsuitable or inadequate.  There is also the issue of, for example, Cope in Cork where 1,500 people attend for day care.  We have a huge problem now of an aging caring population.  We have elderly parents.  I have people in their 80s who are looking after a son or a daughter.  In one case, a man is dropping his daughter to a day-care facility every day and picking her up every evening.  There are a huge number of families who, in the next four to six years, will not be able to do that.  I am concerned that the amount of respite care is decreasing.  It is something we need to plan for but I am not satisfied that we are doing so.  Will the Minister agree to take this matter up with the HSE?  What are the projections for the next two to three years having regard to people being cared for by parents now but who will end up needing permanent and full-time care as no immediate family member will be available to look after them?

My apologies.  In real terms, it is what we have taken on in management as we have taken grades 6 and 7 out of the managerial category.  It has gone from 4,700 to 5,400 in real terms.  We changed how we defined \"management\".  I do not understand why one major hospital in this country had its tenth manager in 18 years start this week.  It has had ten managers in 18 years.  There is something wrong there.  Either the pay structure is wrong or the categorisation of that particular managerial post is not correct.  No institution can operate when there are ten managers over an 18-year time period.  Issues like that must be examined.  We seem to have a huge problem with management and people turning over in positions.  When one goes back to a person after six months to see if something has been done, one finds that one is now dealing with someone else.  I am finding that very difficult to deal with in the HSE.<\/p> <p>  I want to deal with doctors and recruitment.  A survey was published in the last few days which set out that approximately 80% do not see themselves working in Ireland in the medical area.  We have had this problem for ten years but nothing has been done to address it.  We produced the MacRea report, but things seem to be going backwards rather than forwards.  For example, two thirds of doctor registrations in Ireland in 2015 were of doctors from outside the European Union.  We do not appear to be dealing with that issue or to have a long-term plan.  We carried out a major review in 2003 setting out exactly what needed to be done and we carried out another one in the last two or three years again setting out what we are doing, but it seems we are not making progress.  We can make demands about waiting lists, but unless we have the people with the expertise to do the operations and provide the care, we are going nowhere.  We seem to have our priorities wrong and to have put all of our resources into recruiting management and administrative staff while doing nothing to deal with the recruitment of front-line staff.  While we seem to have come to grips with the nursing issue, where a lot of progress has been made, we have done nothing about the junior doctor issue, especially in the smaller hospitals in Letterkenny, Sligo, Castlebar, Clonmel, Waterford and Tralee, etc.  We have had a particular difficulty retaining junior doctors, which is an issue we must address if we want to provide the services people want from our health care service.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister for dealing with these issues.

On pages 2 and 3, the Minister referred to cost overruns around decisions made subsequent to the national service plan.

I have two things to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#K00500","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":625,"content":"<p>What are the actual and anticipated costs for this year and next year, respectively, for things that were not anticipated in the service plan, such as the wage agreements?  I refer to things that increase the cost of delivering the service but do not shift or increase the amount of service being offered.  It is important because when we look at what the service plan set out to achieve, it is not the same as the level of needs that exist for people.  I will return to that in my next question.<\/p> <p> I was happy to see page 4 of the Minister's submission which looks at the end of this year and into next year, that it refers to the service pressures being experienced.  It references disability services particularly and notes that \" ... the pressures in disability services largely arise as a result of regulatory compliance, emergency places and in non-achievement of targeted savings\".  That is fair enough at one level but I contend that there is significant unmet need which is not captured in that because it was not going to be addressed this year.  That is important to say.  We have 1,200 people misplaced in nursing homes.  They are young people with disabilities, some of them are the Minister's own age and all of them within the age groups of the people sitting in this room.  It is frightening.  The average length of stay of someone in a nursing home is around two years, but it is not for these people.  We have other pressures that others have spoken of such as home helps, personal assistants, therapies and aids and appliances.  When we look to next year, we should remember there are many areas which are not captured that still have outstanding needs. <\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned emergency places and expressed his concern and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on the matter.  There are many more issues for young people in addition to emergency places.  I mentioned personal assistants, aids and appliances, which are areas where need is growing.  If we look at next year, what will be within the service plan and what will not be addressed in it in terms of outstanding needs?<\/p> <p>  The Minister reminded us of the statutory underpinning of the community services.  There is no doubt in my mind - and I cannot see that anyone would credibly disagree with me -  that the statutory underpinning of nursing homes on one hand, and the level of resources for community interventions on the other, is sucking people out of the community and into residential places unnecessarily and wrongly.  I cannot see the statutory underpinning being done next week or the week after but something has to be done to correct that bias or tracking in the system.  Something must be put in place, even if it is not ideal, to start to redress that.  Ultimately, there must be more tools and more resources in the tool kit to make sure that people can stay where they ought to.  It is ironic that we have a programme to get people who have lived in institutions all their lives out of them when every day there are people within the HSE - and I do not suggest they want to do this - actively suggesting to people that they go into a nursing home.  In many cases, that is the only option they are given.  That is a chronic issue.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask a hard question on scoliosis, and we could mention other issues.  To what extent do issues such as scoliosis or Orkambi displace resources from other areas?  If they are not, there must have been capacity in the system which was not used.  It is a hard question because, no more than the Minister, I am not trying to suggest that these groups should not be provided with services but we need to be honest.  Are we at a point where we are robbing Peter to pay Paul?  It is important that we be honest about that.  When one sees there are so many quantified and known unmet needs, it is hard not to come to that conclusion.  <\/p> <p>  During the year, this committee invited before it some of the main umbrella and representative groups across the disability and mental health sectors.  One of the themes to come out of that was that there are many things that should be happening outside the health system that have an impact.  If people get a decent education, public transport, housing - they can be rhymed off - and these things work well for people with disabilities, it will take pressure off the Department of Health in time.  It will not do so in time for its Estimates next year, that is clear.  I am not convinced that enough space is being given within health planning to start serious conversations with other Departments.  They are all enjoined in the UN Convention, the disability strategy and so on.  When things are not being done elsewhere, the consequences finish in health, and worse still, people with disabilities finish up where they do not belong.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#L00100","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I will begin by responding to Deputy Louise O'Reilly.  I would be interested in following up on Deputy O'Reilly's point about home help and the not-for-profit sector.  She has had to leave for understandable reasons but I undertake to do that and engage further with her on that and make my Department officials available to her to further pursue it.  We will ask the HSE to revert to her with a breakdown of how much of the homecare budget is spent in the various sectors, voluntary, not-for-profit, public and private.  That is certainly worth exploring.<\/p> <p>  On the day of publication of the hospital waiting list figures, last month's figures showed a significant drop in the number waiting for inpatient day case procedures of more than 2,000.  The Deputy chose not to acknowledge that, which is her prerogative, but it means 2,000 fewer people waiting for operations in Ireland last month than the previous month.  The figures are still too large but it was a sizable decrease in the numbers.  We need a lot more of that.  The figures are published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, a statutory agency, but I have no issue with asking them to publish them on a day other than Friday.  I was working at 6 p.m. on Friday and through the weekend, as I am sure many Members do, but if it is suitable to have them published on a different day of the week, I will ask the NTPF to do so.  <\/p> <p>  We will revert to the Deputy with a note on the National Advisory Council on Drugs.<\/p> <p>  On the breastfeeding programme and the baby-friendly hospital initiative, I am informed it underwent a review in 2016 which recommended the need for a revised model to be developed in line with our new maternity strategy as well as the national breastfeeding action plan.  The HSE's health promotion and improvement unit is now engaging with a range of stakeholders for the development of a revised model.  They have assured me that the focus in developing a revised model is not in any way related to funding or any funding reduction but is aimed at ensuring there is increased engagement across the 19 maternity hospitals in order to increase breastfeeding rates.  The HSE is not reducing funding for breastfeeding and the new model, when developed, will be funded by the HSE.  It is clear about that.<\/p><p>The Deputy is entirely correct that breastfeeding rates in this country are too low.  We need to ensure that we have an initiative that aligns with our maternity strategy and the breastfeeding action plan, and that will get the absolute maximum engagement across all of our 19 hospitals.  The HSE has also told me that it continues to support the 19 maternity hospitals in their implementation of the World Health Organization and UNICEF's ten steps to successful breastfeeding.  As the Deputy will be aware, the action plan for breastfeeding sets out the priority areas to be addressed over the next five years to support more mothers in Ireland to breastfeed and to contribute to increasing breastfeeding rates.  That includes the implementation of policies at hospital level and at community level, investment in breastfeeding training and skills development for health care staff, the promotion of additional lactation specialists posts, and a partnership working to promote a culture that accepts and supports breastfeeding.  I will keep in touch with the Deputy in that regard.<\/p><p> On the issue of capital, the director general of the HSE is entirely correct.  The health service needs more capital.  We have adequate capital to deliver on our projects for this year but we, like other Departments, are engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the capital envelopes that will be announced on budget day but also, excitingly, on the ten-year capital plan.  We have not had a ten-year capital plan in this country previously.  We have had seven or eight year plans.  A ten-year capital plan provides us with an opportunity as a society not only in the health area, but right across the sector, to deliver some important projects that can make a real difference.  It could not be coming at a better time for the health service because we now have a ten-year policy plan in Sl&aacute;intecare and we will shortly have a bed capacity review which will have looked at demographic pressures and bed capacity needs not only in the acute hospital sector, but right across the health service.<\/p><p> On the issue of Crumlin theatre, I do not disagree with any of the Deputies.  When I came into this job, the theatre in Crumlin was shut.  It was not doing any of these operations.  It is open now and operating three days a week.  There is an extra consultant and extra theatre nurses in place.  More operations have been done in Crumlin and Temple Street combined this year to date than in the entire of last year.<\/p><p> We have put &euro;10 million more into treating scoliosis.  It is a major priority.  I confirm we are using outsourcing not because we want to, but because we want to provide every opportunity to every possible family that requires this to make the decision that is best for their child.  It will not work for some families to go abroad but the ultimate aim is to arrive at a position where we have a sustainable scenario in the public health service in this country and every child can be provided with an operation for scoliosis, or a scoliosis-related issue, within the four-month target.  As for where the four-month target comes from, it is international best practice.  It is what the NHS does and it is what clinical advice tells us needs to be done.  We will not be found wanting in that regard.  I note the Deputy has a question to me tomorrow to me in relation to the 68 patients she specifically referred to and I will engage with her on that then.<\/p><p> I agree with Senator Colm Burke on respite and I will ask the HSE and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to engage with the Senator, and, if it wishes, perhaps this committee on the projections for the next two to three years on respite requirements.  The Senator was not suggesting, and nor am I, that HIQA standards are in any way bad.  It is great that we have standards, but the consequence of those standards in terms of the number of places available for those requiring respite and how we will address that is a legitimate point.<\/p><p> We need to be very careful when members talk about manager numbers because, with respect to those in this room, they would rightly be among the first to give out if they could not get an answer to a parliamentary query, to which they have a democratic right, because included in the manager-administrative figures are the staff who answer those questions.  Also included are the staff who process medical cards and those who were taken on to deliver new models of care.  The cross-party Sl&aacute;intecare committee stated that we need more staff to develop e-health and ICT so that we have better data, better decision-making, better processes and more accurate and efficient lists.  Included in that are managers and administrators.  We need a new financial system so that we can have more intelligent discussions on how the figures are done.<\/p><p> I am no supporter of extra layers of bureaucracy or management.  I believe the HSE needs to be pared back.  I want to work with the Sl&aacute;intecare report in terms of how best to achieve that, but merely taking a headline figure and presuming everybody there is a manager and that, therefore, there is no added value to the health needs of the population is far too simplistic an exercise.  In fact, many of the members would be the first to put down PQs to me asking why we have not rolled out this new clinical programme, where are we at with the e-health agenda, what am I doing about the new model of care, and how the Healthy Ireland agenda is going.  The answers to all of those questions often involve personnel who would fall into the category of administrator or manager.  Let us absolutely have a good scrutiny of the figures, and if the committee wants the HSE here to go through it, let us do that.  I would be right beside the member in supporting the assertion that we should not have extra layers of management but let us be clear about what we are discussing.<\/p><p> Let us also be clear - I say this to Senator Colm Burke - that the focus in the HSE on increasing front-line staff is paramount.  Often when one hears conversations - stakeholders, interest groups and representative bodies do important work - one would swear that there are fewer staff working in the health service on the front line.  It is, quite frankly, not true.  The number of consultants employed by the HSE at the end of December 2016 was 2,862.  This is an increase of 138 whole-time equivalents in the health service since December 2015 and it is an increase of 731 consultant posts in the past decade.  I beg the Chairman's indulgence for one minute on this because this is neither reported nor commented on.  In relation to consultant anaesthetists, in 2010, there were 348.35; in 2015, some 349.6; in 2016, some 373, and now there are 374.  In relation to consultants in emergency medicine, in 2010 there were 56; in 2015, there were 82; in 2016, some 92, and now we have 93.  In relation to consultant medicine, in 2010, there were 518; in 2015, some 675; in 2016, there were 723, and in 2017 there are 727.  I could go on and on.<\/p><p> These are figures taken from the personnel census data for medical and dental in all agencies broken down by grade and group for December 2010, 2015, 2016 and up to March 2017.  I will share this with the committee.  The committee will see that there are some areas, particularly in dentistry, where we need to do much better but there are many areas where we have consistently seen an increase in figures since 2010.  We are back to hiring staff and wanting more people to work in the health service on the front line.  We are back to investing in the health service also.  That does not mean everything is rosy.  There are extraordinary challenges but let us not distort the reality.  More people are working in consultant positions in the HSE and in the health service today than last year, and certainly significantly more than over the past ten years.<\/p><p> We need to do a great deal more to retain our doctors.  That is why we asked Professor Brian MacCraith, president of Dublin City University, to carry out a strategic review of what we need to do to make more attractive career opportunities for the clinicians and medical graduates in this country.  I spoke at a medical careers day in Dublin Castle on Saturday last where I met 500 of the new medical graduates and medical interns to talk to them about the importance of them staying in the Irish health service because we need them.  It is a case of the chicken and the egg here.  We have a ten-year plan for the first time in a long time.  We have a cross-party view in relation to health care for the first time ever.  We are reinvesting in health but we need the health care professionals to stay here with us so that we can make the improvements.  We are working through implementing the three reports and the 25 recommendations of the MacCraith report.  To date, five of the progress reports have been published on the Department's website.  A number of issues have been addressed, including the HSE doubling the number of family-friendly places over the next three years.  Our NCHD numbers continue to increase.  A careers and training website has been launched and the majority of our training programmes now offer predefined rotations of at least two years to make it easier for people to plan.  We have an online national employment record which has streamlined the process and the paperwork associated with rotation.  On foot of a key recommendation, the implementation of higher pay rates for new entrant consultants was sanctioned in 2015.  This is an acute area.  We have a lot more to do but there is a lot happening in that regard.<\/p><p> I thank Senator Dolan for his comments.  The Senator hit the nail on the head in many ways in relation to unmet need and trying to capture what is unmet need not only now, but in the future.  There are more patients with chronic diseases being treated in the health service, and there is also the rising phenomenon of people with disabilities thankfully living longer, with the resulting impact on a parent in his or her 70s, 80s or even older of having a son or daughter with a disability in his or her 40s, 50s or 60s.  The issue is how the State meets those needs, and there are a number of ways that is done.  I do not dispute that resourcing is one part, but also better models, of which Senator Dolan is a supporter, is a big part.  I will give the example of a very small but important thing we did this year with the group, An Saol.  This is a group of people who have loved ones with acquired brain injuries.  They went off - I do not want to misrepresent their position - and did an analysis of the support that the State was providing to their loved ones on paper and basically asked if we could let them reconfigure that support.<\/p><p>We do not want our loved ones, including those in their 30s, which is around my age, to be in nursing homes.  If we were given control of that budget, which is already being spent on our loved ones, we could put it to much better use in order to give our loved ones a much more purposeful life, more rehabilitation and a better chance of getting back to the potential which we want them to reach.  We need to do much more of that.<\/p><p> The Senator is correct about the fair deal scheme.  Criteria obviously have to be met before a person can be admitted to a nursing home but it is concerning that we have a statutory scheme for nursing home care with the weight of a legal framework and all that comes with it in the context of entitlement and resourcing.  Almost &euro;1 billion is spent each year in that area and yet we have community supports, home care supports, home help packages and respite care which are not underpinned by statute.  It varies on a geographic basis.  Many people are afraid that if their mother, father or other loved one gets ten hours one week, it might go down to perhaps eight hours the next week; and it never seems to be 11 hours.  These are real concerns.  The Government and I fully agree with the Senator about the need to underpin this in statute.  He is right that this is not going to happen overnight, nor should it since it could be very detrimental if we got it wrong.  We do not want a situation where people staying at home-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#L00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":629,"content":"<p>We should ensure that there is some provision in the interim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#N00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":630,"content":"<p>In the interim, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#N00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":631,"content":"<p>There has to be a first fix that starts now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#N00400","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":632,"content":"<p>That is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#N00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":633,"content":"<p>We can bring in regulation and do all sorts of things and then regret it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#N00600","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":634,"content":"<p>That is right, and I am sure no-one wants to see HIQA regulating somebody's mother's sitting room as if it were a nursing home.

We will keep in touch about that.<\/p> <p>  I do not want, for the reasons the Senator outlined, to personalise this in the context of any one decision made in the health service versus another, but there is an opportunity cost in any Department.  Regardless of how well-funded the Department of Health or any other Department might be, if a decision is taken to do one thing, that will have an impact in terms of the ability to do another.  It is just like running a house: if one decides to do something, it will have an effect on one's household budget.  We are constantly grappling with that.  If we buy one drug, will there be sufficient resources to all us to buy another?  If we do one thing in the disability sector, will that have an impact in another sector?  There will always be a degree of grappling with issues of this nature in every health service around the world.  I am convinced - the Senator has heard the Taoiseach articulate this in recent days - that it cannot just be a Celtic tiger-style discussion about how much more money the health sector gets.  It is important that we resource the health service.  In that context, I am involved in the discussions on the Estimates.  It is a matter of how the money is spent and how it is linked to outcomes.  It is how we ensure that the money we spend in the area of disability delivers for people with disabilities.  When I meet stakeholders and citizens throughout the country, they highlight examples of the efficiencies that could be achieved or outline better ways of delivering services.<\/p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report provides a good roadmap.  I do not agree with every word it contains in respect of sequences and costings but I think the committee has respected the job I have to do regarding due diligence.  The report takes us on a journey for the next ten years, building on progress every year.  It would give us a much more efficient vehicle.  If one has an inefficient vehicle, one can increase the amount of fuel put into it but it is still inefficient.

As he knows, while the Minister of State cannot be physically based in every Department, he is assigned to three.  That is an initial reflection of the reality whereby there is a health need.  However, that need often arises in areas in which it was not met earlier.  It may not have been met as early as preschool, at an early intervention stage or it could be a matter of enabling an older person with a disability to get the bus so he or she can retain his or her independence.  It could also be a case of someone getting a job.  Without getting into too much detail, it is obviously a whole-of-Government issue.

Before I bring in Deputy Durkan, I have a few observations and comments.  The document notes an underspend in primary care of several million and an overspend in the hospital service of &euro;104 million.  I think these items are related.  There is evidence to show that for every &euro;1 spent in primary care, one will save &euro;5 in secondary and tertiary care.  If we continue to underfund primary care, the natural result will be that we will end up with a more expensive hospital system.  There is evidence that the attendance rate for patients at emergency departments is 40% less than in the UK.  That is because we still have, for the most part, a same-day general practice service.  In the general practice service in England, one can wait from ten days to three weeks to see a GP and that leads to huge amounts of work being transferred to the hospital service.  In Ireland, we still have a same-day service for general practice but it is dwindling because we resourcing for primary care has been reduced and there is a huge shortage of GPs.  The HSE maintains that there are only 17 or 18 vacancies at any particular time but many practices are being lost and amalgamated.  In addition, services are being moved further away from patients, particularly in rural areas.  The underspend in primary care has a natural consequence which, I believe, is the overspend on the hospital service.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  There has been a reduction in the funding to public hospitals from private health insurance.  Ireland is unique in that its public hospital system is dependent on private health insurance coming to fund its services.  The reduction in private health insurance income to our public hospitals must be having a service impact and I think that probably leads to our waiting lists being extended.<\/p> <p>  There is an issue with the number of patients seen by nurses.  I presume that refers to the number of public health nurses that are available.  There is huge pressure on public health nurses.  There has been a 28% reduction in the number of patients seeing nurses.  Is that a reflection of our difficulties in retaining and recruiting public health nurses?<\/p> <p>  Senator Dolan referred to respite care.  There was a reduction of 10,000 in the number of respite nights in the first half of this year.  Will the Minister comment on that?  It is a huge reduction in respite care for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  Comments were made earlier on the targets for inpatient, outpatient and day-case procedures.  Are those targets realistic?  I am of the view that they are very modest and that the problem is that they are not being met.  They are not being met because of bed shortages and recruitment issues.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.<\/p> <p>  Some hospitals have good trolley numbers and others do not.  I think this relates to the catchment area of those hospitals.  Areas where there has been reconfiguration - such as Ennis and Nenagh, which lost acute services that were moved to Limerick, Drogheda, where associated hospitals were reconfigured, and Galway, where hospitals lost their acute services - have the highest trolley counts.  That is a direct reflection of how reconfiguration was mismanaged.  It also reflects position regarding catchment areas.  For example, the catchment area in the mid-west is home to approximately 440,000 people whereas the catchment areas of some Dublin hospitals may not be that size and, consequently, they may not have the same pressure on their services.<\/p><p>We have failed to reach targets for breast, lung and prostate cancer.  We have failed to meet the radiotherapy targets.  This must be a reflection of the recruitment and retention of staff as well as bed capacity.  Soon we will only be able to provide acute care and cancer care because of the lack of beds for patients seeking elective procedures.  There is significant pressure on the accident and emergency department of acute hospitals.  Patients who attend at accident and emergency departments are being admitted to beds which would normally be reserved for elective admissions.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that.<br\/><br\/>I have information that most of the money allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund is being spent on day cases rather than on inpatient procedures such as hip or knee replacements or procedures that would require a prolonged stay in hospital.  Care authorisation notices for public hospitals were issued to 2,496 patients, but only 104 patients had a procedure as an inpatient, which is 0.4% of those who had been offered a service.  In the case of people whose needs were outsourced to private hospitals, some 5,295 care authorisation notices issued, yet only 946 patients, which is 18% of cases, had their surgery completed.  <br\/><br\/>In regard to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, 32% of adolescents are still being admitted to adult institutions for care.  That is quite an extraordinary figure.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on it.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Alan Kelly raised the issue of St. Joseph's Hospital in Ennis.  I know it is <i>sub judice<\/i>.  St. Joseph's is an old hospital and issues arise because it cannot provide services that could be provided in a new hospital.  There is a proposal to build a 50 bed unit in St. Joseph's to replace the existing beds but the planning, design, procurement and building of such a facility is a four-year process.  That is too long for an essential service.  Will the Minister comment on those observations and questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#N01400","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late arrival but the traffic was hectic this morning.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Chairman's observation on the need to ensure that adequate private health insurance patients are diverted towards the public hospital service.  I had a recent case where a patient was refused access to the public hospital system because they had private health care insurance.  That is the policy.  The person opted for the public hospital because they had been there before, but because it was an emergency case and the person had private health insurance, access was refused.  I do not think it is a good practice at all to refuse to admit private patients and I brought this case to the attention of the Minister privately.  <\/p> <p>  The availability of hospital services has been the subject matter of discussion for as long as I have been around.  It requires further attention.  We need to look at glitches that cause hiccups in the system, backlogs in accident and emergency departments and long waiting times for admissions.  We need to look at the extent to which the needs of those who present at accident and emergency departments as an emergency should have been met by admission as an inpatient or to day care.  I also came across a situation very recently where a patient was being recycled through the accident and emergency department and discharged on more than one occasion to a rural hospital, instead of being admitted to hospital for the necessary procedure.  This should not be happening.  The staff in the accident and emergency department should be able to come to a conclusion that these patients are in severe pain and require urgent attention.  There must be a reason that this care is not provided.  We need to assess what impedes the flow through the system.  <\/p> <p>  It was brought to my attention that a consultant who wishes to work in the public hospital system found that he could operate for the whole day in a private hospital whereas in a public hospital he could only perform two procedures because of the lack of theatre staff, an anaesthetist or some other personnel.  There was some reason that he could not operate for the whole day.  The Sl&aacute;intecare programme will go down the tubes unless we can identify the cause of problems and remedy them.  We need a trouble shooter in the system who can pinpoint what will go wrong long before it becomes obvious.  I will not refer to the issue of scoliosis that was referred to already.  Imagine what it is like to be disabled and to have to live in cramped conditions.  Why was it not possible to identify the scale of those requiring treatment for scoliosis long before it became a public issue?  We all heard about it at the same time.  Those requiring treatment for scoliosis were in the system as they had been assessed as requiring urgent treatment.  We need to conduct an audit of the deficiencies in the system in order to identify how we can intervene in a positive way to ensure that it meets the requirements of the patients as quickly as possible and in so far as possible.<\/p> <p>  Our health service is not the most poorly funded health service in Europe by a long shot.  I am trying to avoid criticising the services directly.  We tend to comment negatively on the GP, hospital, day care and accident and emergency services so that nobody wants to take up a GP practice when it becomes available for the simple reason that the system is being dumbed-down and there is no future in it.  Nobody wants to take on a role where there is no future.  That should be known to everybody.  I am aware of a recent case where there was only one applicant for a job.  If we do not address the problem, young professionals will seek to work in places where they do not have that hassle and also have to deal with the ancillary issues such as the cost of houses which are twice as expensive as elsewhere.  The GP does not only have to pay for the practice, but also pay for a house.<\/p> <p>  Members have referred already to the fire fighting issues and the need to stamp out the crisises as they occur.  We need to identify the causes instead of wasting our time fighting them.  That is not a criticism of any person, but we need to take action.<\/p> <p>  If we are attempting to deal with the high cost of drugs in Ireland on our own, we will not succeed.  It will not be solved on the basis of an amalgam of 13 or 14 EU members states applying an average price across member states.  Effectively the major drug companies blackmail governments by feeding the drugs into the system in the first instance, and achieving patient satisfaction because the new drugs are a significant advance on what was available previously.  Then the drug companies can demand a ransom figure to supply them.<\/p><p>The orphan drugs and ransom figures will be associated in future as it is what is happening.  No single government across Europe will be able to address such a problem.<\/p><p> There is the question of agency staff, which has not been raised.  I know, having been a member of a health board for some time, that there is always a need for some agency staff.  However, the degree to which the system has become reliant on agency staff is now alarming, as are the costs associated with them.  I realise locums and emergency staff must be paid more to fill needs at a particular time.  However, the more we become reliant on those staff, the more expensive and less efficient the system becomes, with less patient satisfaction.  The patient likes to know the person he or she is dealing with and that the same person is there all the time.  The patient would immediately raise questions if a third person is introduced to the process and it suffers as a result.<\/p><p> There are a couple of other matters I will address before concluding.  We have the ability to provide a good health service in this country and everyone is striving to do that.  We need to recognise that we also need to achieve efficiencies in the system.  I have my own views and the committee has heard them.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, does not deliver and it is not suitable for the delivery of services throughout the country.  There is no use referring us to the greater Manchester area because we have a comparable population and it should have the same type of service.  That is not true as there is a vast geographical difference and many miles must be covered by people.  Hence the difficulty in providing services to the rural areas to the extent we have come to expect.<\/p><p> We know that we have been able to provide services.  Perhaps we were not able to do it as well as we would have liked but we were able do it.  It was still possible to get emergency access, although I know that is still possible if one gets through the accident and emergency department process I spoke of.  There are competing demands nowadays that we all recognise within Departments and between Departments.  We know all that.  If we are to look after the health care requirements of the community, we must be able to assure the people that the taxpayers' money being spent on the delivery of health services to the public is adequate to meet people's concerns and demands in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#O00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his questions.  I reiterate the point on the primary care budget, amounting to more than &euro;1 billion per year, which is seeing a shortfall for this point in the year of &euro;7.7 million.  It is my expectation and that of the HSE that the full primary care budget will be expended this year.  I reassure the committee in that respect.  I very much take the Chairman's point and I made it myself in recent weeks, when people endeavoured to misrepresent publicly the fees paid to GPs as though the fee paid to a GP equated to the income of a GP, which it certainly does not.  A GP in this country effectively has to run a small or medium business, hiring staff and practice nurses.  The GP is paid to provide a service, and in my view that service is one of good value and it is valued by our citizens.<\/p> <p>  Members are correct in that a new contract for GPs is badly needed and we do not want to lose what is good about general practice in this country.  It is the one area where we do not have a waiting list.  I do not agree with those in general practice who believe this means we can never extend free GP care to children.  I do not believe that and that can happen, although it must be done as part of a bigger discussion about resourcing and the sustainability of general practice into the future.  That is why when I became Minister for Health, rather than just wanting to speak to GPs about free GP care for children and nothing else, I asked to have the conversation as part of a broader discussion, asking what we need to do to help general practice to be sustainable into the future and addressing the challenges in rural areas and areas of urban deprivation with respect to the availability of GPs.  If we are to resource general practice better and invest in general practice, as the Chairman and Deputy Durkan noted, we must consider the benefit of that to the acute hospital sector.<\/p> <p>  I believe we can all agree that here patients must present at an acute hospital but in other countries they simply never would have to arrive there.  That is not a criticism of patients as they no more want to be there than the man in the moon but they have nowhere else to go.  The Chairman is a GP and knows this but I am told by GPs all the time that they can do more but can only do it if they are resourced to do more.  They are up for doing more.  I do not want to say too much more because of the ongoing discussions.

It is a point legitimately raised by GP organisations.  I do not want to negotiate publicly on discussions that are taking place as part of the broader conversation.  I want GPs and the people to hear this broader message.  I am talking about expanding services and making general practice more accessible to people.  People may have lain awake last night wondering if they had the &euro;60 to bring a child to a doctor today.  I see such people in my constituency office and other members probably know them too.  They do not qualify for a medical card or a GP visit card and they worry about making ends meet.  I will not do something that gives with one hand but takes something away with the other.  If GP care is made free, there could be a very long waiting list to see the GP.  We are working on a multi-annual basis to put in place a programme of reforms and investment in general practice that will enable the Government to pursue some of its democratic mandate in terms of extending eligibility to free GP care but which will enable GPs to deliver that in a manner they believe is sustainable.  When I became Minister, I could have continued down the road of saying I just wanted to talk about free GP care for children.  We have not done that and the Chairman's involvement with the programme for Government broadened that discussion on the GP contract.  We will continue with that.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of GP training places, it is disappointing all the training places were not taken up this year.  There is no getting away from that.  There are approximately 16 vacant places.  That needs to be seen in context.  In 2009, we trained 120 GPs per year and this year we will train 170.  We are continuing to expand and we will continue to expand the number of GP places.  The point made by Deputy Durkan is crucial.  If we as a country or society look to speak about the health service only in a negative fashion, it will not do much to encourage others to get involved.  This is a point about the chicken and egg.  To improve services, we need more speech and language therapists, nurses and doctors to take up work in the Irish health service.  If we had had this conversation five years ago, it would have been somewhat academic as we would not have been recruiting.  We are now recruiting and these people need to know they are working in a health service that values and appreciates them.  They need to know there is a clear policy direction that will not keep changing.  Sl&aacute;intecare is the basis for that.  Equally, I need those people to work in the health service and provide balance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#P00800","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I have spoken to the Minister about postgraduate education for general practice on a number of occasions, particularly the appointment of GP tutors to run our postgraduate medical education scheme, which is essential to keep GPs up to date and informed about new procedures, policies and protocols as well as keeping them educated.

It is essential that it is funded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#P00900","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":653,"content":"<p>I am actively looking at it.  I recently met a delegation on the issue.  The Chairman is very passionate about it and he has brought it to my attention.  I need to look at it in the context of the fact we do not fund postgraduate training for other elements of the health service, so there is an equity piece here.  I am looking at it and I do hear feedback, not just from the Chairman, and passionately from him, that it is a model that works.  I am looking at it in the context of budgetary matters.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the private health insurance issue, the Chairman is correct that the income reduction level is a factor in the growing deficit.  I am pleased to say there is not a service reduction.  The Oireachtas, for better or worse, passed legislation that is very clear on how this operates.  Private health insurance companies have a different view and that is causing a real challenge here.  It is something we are going to have to look at from a variety of perspectives.<\/p> <p>  On the public and private piece, it is interesting that the Taoiseach's maiden speech in this House was on decoupling public and private medicine.  That is not to suggest that people with private health insurance do not have a right to have private health insurance or that doctors do not have a right to practice private medicine.  However, it is hard - the Sl&aacute;intecare committee arrived at this point - at a time when emergency departments, EDs, are crowded and public service waiting lists are lengthy, to work out how someone with private health insurance can use a public hospital bed ahead of someone who might have a greater clinical need but cannot afford private health insurance.  It is easy to say that as a political point of view and it is one I share passionately.  I spoke about it at the Health Management Institute, HMI, conference this week.  If one were to say in the morning that one was going to decouple public and private health care, one would blow a hole in the health budget of about &euro;700 million, so this is something we need to look at.  Sl&aacute;intecare calls for an impact study to be done, which I think is a really welcome body of work, and I have announced this week that it is my intention to proceed with that.  We have to ask ourselves, when we have public beds in public hospitals, why public patients cannot access them while private practice in the public hospital can continue unabated.  That is a real challenge.<\/p> <p>  I fully take the point on the question about some hospitals performing well and others not.  I am not in any way endeavouring to dispute the fact that in certain parts of this country there are certain challenges that may or not exist in other parts.  The point about reconfiguration is correct.  I support the reconfiguration measures that took place, but they took place on the promise of more beds at some point in the future, and in some places those beds have yet to materialise.  I get that.  We are in discussions about the 96-bed block that is needed for the University Hospital Limerick.  I do not want my crucial point to be lost and I do not think it is lost, namely, that if one just looks at hospitals as stand-alone hospitals, it is evident that all hospitals are seeing increases.  All hospitals are facing a situation with more patients being older and therefore staying longer, and all hospitals are seeing more chronic care.  Despite this, Beaumont Hospital, Connolly Hospital, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Cavan hospital, Mayo hospital - without any extra beds and with more patients - have seen fewer people on trolleys.  I am not making it overly simplistic.  They are the INMO figures from January to July this year.  As a people and political system, we need to ask why that is.  I know why it is.  It is because of good patient flow and really hard work throughout the hospitals.  That is not to suggest that other people are not working really hard, but it is about people saying not just that they need more resources, which they do, but that there are also things they can do better within the hospitals for patients.<\/p> <p>  The figures are stark.  A total of 4,282 people were on trolleys in Beaumont from January to July 2016, but this year that was halved to 2,193.  It is still far too many people on trolleys but it is clear that something was done in that hospital and this is the learning I am trying to embody in the system.  We have to scrutinise that.  One could say it is a big Dublin hospital but look at Cavan.  There used to be an emergency department in Monaghan but there has not been for a number of years, yet Cavan General Hospital for the same period this year saw 207 people on trolleys compared with 621 last year.  I am purposely cherry-picking the good ones.  There are many on this list that have gone the opposite way, so while I do not suggest in any way that the trolley situation is getting better, I am suggesting that some hospitals are using good practice and we should learn from each other.  Any system that does not learn from another is not good.  When we talk about hospitals and trolleys, we need to point out that some hospitals are making significant progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#Q00100","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":654,"content":"<p>I accept some hospitals are making progress but the Minister freely admitted he is not quite sure what the reasons are.

If it is not for want of effort on the part of the staff, and we can all agree that is the case, then we must look at what is working in one hospital and what is not working in another hospital and try to examine if the hospital needs support.  Very often the supports may not be hugely expensive but they may make a big difference.  In this regard I suggest that the Minister should talk to front-line staff.

We know the RCSI hospitals group can reduce waiting lists not by any one hospital or consultant owning the waiting list or the patients on the waiting list but by utilising the small level 2 and level 3 hospitals that work.  These are the conversations I am having with the HSE.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report refers clearly to this.  I was going to make this point to the Chairman.  He has spoken about arriving at a point where the unscheduled care demand becomes so great that we do not have the capacity in our health service to deal with the elective work.  I have spoken about this publicly.  I believe each of our hospital groups need to look at the idea of elective-only centres.  The private hospital sector is doing this already.  The new deputy director general of the HSE is John Connaghan.  He was working in National Health Service Scotland.  Let us consider what they did in the Scottish NHS.  The public health service there bought up a hospital in Glasgow and used it as an elective-only centre.  This drove down the waiting lists because it decoupled trolleys from the waiting lists.  I will be looking at that in the context of all the various discussions with budgets and capital plans that we are engaged in now.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that there are many questions and I have no wish to delay too much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#R00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":673,"content":"<p>Did Senator Burke want to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#R00700","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I wish to go back to the hospital management issue.  Earlier, I raised the question of a tenth manager being recruited in 18 years.  There must be a problem in the smaller hospitals because there seems to be a vast turnover of administrative staff at senior levels.  I appeal for this issue should be looked at.  In fairness, no matter how big or small the hospital, the hospital manager is dealing with a complex job involving people who are doing the cleaning, porters, catering staff, nurses, junior doctors and consultants.  There is skill in managing all these interest groups.  We seem to have a difficulty in retaining senior staff in the smaller hospitals.

We have already seen a successful international recruitment campaign for the two new deputy director generals of the HSE.  It is a question of bringing in outside experience of what works.  It is not all stick.  There has to be a carrot too.<\/p> <p>  I also want to look at how we support people in managerial roles.  Senator Burke made a point earlier about training.  The HSE has done a number of things recently to help.  We simply appoint the hospital manager and then say he is on his own and send him off to it.  We must ensure people have skill sets and feel part of a support network in terms of having advice.  They need to be able to learn from the best experiences in hospitals that are going well.  We will absolutely look further at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#R00900","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I wish to make another comment before the Minister leaves the discussion on the acute hospital sector.  The Minister asked why some hospitals are performing better than others.  Apart from some hospitals having a greater catchment population than others, there are numerous other issues.  Some hospitals have senior decision-makers on the floor on a 24-7 basis.  It is vital that hospitals have 24-7 senior decision-makers.  Junior doctors do not have the experience or capacity to make the important decisions about admitting or discharging.  That is critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#R01000","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I agree absolutely.  Again, it is back to management needing to ensure we have a complement of rostered senior decision-makers doing the rounds, visiting the wards and discharging patients who are ready and who want to go home at the weekends.  It does not take a rocket scientist to work out why our trolley numbers drop as we get towards the end of the week and into the weekend and then begin to take off again.  We are meant to have a 24-7 health service in this country and it requires a 24-7 presence.  There is active interest from us all, from the Minister, the hospital manager, the HSE and the consultants.  We all have to pull together in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I have no wish to come across in any way as being overly negative.  I have seen really good examples from consultants and managers going above and beyond what they are asked to do.  I am simply pointing out that it is not a homogeneous group and we need to stop talking about it as though it is.  We need to learn from the good and the bad and discover the reasons.  We need to share that knowledge.  I am not asking these questions in the abstract.  We are undertaking these activities as we speak.<\/p> <p>  We do not want to have a perverse incentive whereby people are concerned that if they perform well when it comes to a winter initiative, they will be told they do not need help because they are doing well.  We need to convey the message that if someone does well, they get more support to do even better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#R01100","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":678,"content":"<p>There is another factor relating to the integration of primary and secondary care and greater communication between primary and secondary care.  Many patients would not end up in hospital if their problem could be solved through day case or ambulatory care services as opposed to being brought in to be investigated.  They should be investigated with a view to not being admitted.  If there was early access to diagnostics and a specialist opinion, many admissions would be avoided.<\/p> <p>  Model 2 hospitals are not being used to their maximum capacity.  There are three model 2 hospitals in the mid-west, but they are not being given the resources to fulfil their potential.  They have great difficulty in recruiting staff and in securing 24-7 diagnostics, but that would allow patients to be looked after in those hospitals as opposed to going to the tertiary centre, which is the general hospital in the area.  There are ambulance bypass protocols.  If a person falls on the street in the mid-west, he goes to Limerick.  There is no question of him going to a model 2 hospital.  Those model 2 hospitals could be used as triage centres.  For example, if a person is suspected of breaking a hip in the mid-west, he will not be X-rayed in a model 2 hospital.  He must go to the regional hospital to be X-rayed.  He may or may not have a fractured hip but he is now lying on a trolley for a number of hours or days waiting for a diagnosis that could have been delivered in a model 2 hospital.  These hospitals need to be given greater resources to maximise their potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#R01200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":679,"content":"<p>There were other questions but I am afraid we could keep going.  There is a great deal to be said and it is an important conversation.<\/p> <p>  I addressed the issue of respite already when Senator Burke was out of the room.  I addressed it in response to Senator Dolan.  The Chairman raised it as well.  There is clearly an issue.  That is not in any way to criticise HIQA, because HIQA is an independent regulator with a job to do.  There is clearly an issue with the HIQA standards being applied and having a direct impact on the number of respite places available.  That is the point Senator Burke asked us to analyse.  When he was out of the room, I undertook that we would do that in terms of unmet need and projected demand this year, next year and the following year.  I indicated that we would get the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, and the HSE to liaise with the Senator in this regard.  We cannot have one arm of the State doing one thing without the other arm preparing to see how best to respond.  I take on board that point.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The Chairman is right to say the bulk of the work of the NTPF this year is day case work.  The numbers have increased somewhat since the document became available.  The figure referenced of 1.26 is now up to 2.35.  We have seen, through the various initiatives of the HSE and the NTPF, that under phase 1 of the NTPF this year, 2,000 appointments were accepted and 1,112 patients were treated.  Under phase 2, which is the inpatient day case insourcing initiative, we have seen 910 appointments accepted.  Under the inpatient day case outsourcing initiative, which is a third phase and the final part of this year's plan, we have seen 235 appointments accepted.  That is in addition to the outpatient waiting list action plan and the HSE inpatient day case waiting list plan.<\/p> <p>  Another committee member made a point earlier and it bears repeating.  I hope people will be pleased when they see the NTPF initiative for this year, especially with the insourcing element.  This will come to the fore especially as we get to the inpatient procedures.  Reference was made to hips, knees and so on.  I believe there is significant scope, through the NTPF, to insource several of these procedures.  Without getting into granular detail, the likes of Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital and theatres there receive revenue from the NTPF through an insourcing initiative.  I do not want people to think that, ideologically, I am approaching this in the sense that the NTPF should outsource things.  Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly always thinks that when she is talking to no one in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#R01300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I imagine the Minister is looking at no one in particular<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017092700002#R01400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":681,"content":"<p>It is a regular conversation we have.

However, the Deputy has frequently raised with me the need to collaborate on the issue of medicines procurement.  If Ireland endeavours and other countries grapple with the issue separately, we will go around in circles.  We have made progress on this issue since I last met the committee.  I have signed the Valletta declaration which commits Ireland to working with six other countries to engaging in, at a minimum, joint horizon scannings and health technology assessments in which we can share information about the pipeline of new drugs and work together on the issue.  The declaration also leaves open the possibility of jointly procuring drugs.  The challenge in this regard is that not every drug that we need may be needed in another country.  This occurs for a variety of reasons.  Each signatory to the Valletta declaration has been asked to put forward one or two drugs which it is interested in jointly procuring.  It will be interesting to see if some common drugs emerge.  This is the only way to grapple with this major issue.<\/p><p>Ireland and other countries will shortly arrive at the point where patients find that new and innovative technologies have become available and could improve their quality of life or extend their lives, but they are unable to access them because of the pricing structure.  We have done good work with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, the drug representative body here, on savings.

The purpose of the Bill is to give further effect to the Directive 2014\/32\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the member states relating to the making available on the market of measuring instruments, and to provide related matters.  I will not elaborate as the committee has discussed it already.  This technical Bill is required to transpose Articles 1 and 3, which are two articles in the Bill - there are more articles for the directive - on the harmonisation of the laws of the member states relating to the making available on the market of measuring instruments.  The remainder of the directive will be transposed, by way of regulation, under the European Communities Act 1972.<\/p> <p>  We know that we are behind with this Bill.  We also know that the committee has gone out of its way to ensure it gets a speedy resolution here through Committee Stage.  Once the legislation is approved here today Report Stage will be taken in the D&aacute;il and then on to the Seanad as well.  We hope to have the legislation finalised in the coming weeks so that the Bill can go through to the European Commission.  We have worked with the European Commission on this matter as well.  It understands where we are coming from.<\/p> <p>  Again, I thank the members.  I also want to thank the team from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, for its co-operation.

When the chief executive and I last met this committee, a year ago almost to the day, the authority was just nine months old and I was largely looking forward, describing our first steps in establishing a framework to support the authority's statutory function of overseeing the performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and describing what we might do in relation to a range of matters, including senior Garda appointments.  I look forward today to giving you a flavour of what has been achieved in a year and nine months and perhaps of where we might be going next.<\/p>  <p>  Turning first to performance oversight, which is our overarching function, given the very large number of potential areas of work for the authority, our approach to performance oversight has to be planned and disciplined as far as possible, based on a number of principles: to work in a way which is thematic with a view to bringing a focus and depth to each theme and to cover the breath of performance issues over time; to use the policing plan as an essential foundation document by setting priorities and setting performance targets which can to a large extent be measured and then examining progress monthly and to research sources of data, information and experiences which are external to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, partly to help us understand our themes but also to enable the authority to bring depth to each theme and to provide a basis for a challenge conversation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if appropriate.  We make overseeing the Garda response to the recommendations made by other bodies a central pillar of our work, for example, the committee may have recently seen our third report on the implementation of the recommendations in the Garda Inspectorate on changing policing in Ireland.  As far as possible we try not to duplicate the oversight work of others, for example, the issues in respect of the Garda College.<\/p>  <p>  The day-to-day work of supporting this approach is carried out at various levels of information gathering and engagement at official level; formal meetings of authority committees with senior garda&iacute; and formal meetings of the full authority with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at Commissioner level 11 or 12 times a year, five of which are in public this year.  The persistence inherent in this framework, and the rigour it is bringing, represent a very big change for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for the Department of Justice and Equality and for oversight of policing more generally.  Within this framework, for example, the authority held a planned meeting in public about roads policing in April last.<\/p> <p>Another theme chosen by the authority&rsquo;s policing strategy and performance committee in its work plan for this year was the area of the treatment of children by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as both victims, suspects and, indeed, as members of the public.  Considerable work has been done in this area and I am aware the committee may wish to discuss this topic further.<\/p> <p> Since we last appeared before the committee, the authority completed its work in developing and establishing a code of ethics for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the timeframe given to us in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  The code was launched in January last by the T&aacute;naiste and then Minister for Justice and Equality.  In our approach to the code, we went beyond the statutory requirements and established a code for all those who work in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Having a code is only a first step, although an important one of which the authority is proud.  It must now be embedded in all aspects of Garda work.  While it is the responsibility of every person in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to behave and work ethically, it is the responsibility of the Commissioner and Garda leadership to ensure the code is rolled out and embedded.  We are now overseeing the development of a plan by them to embed the code and we will continue to drive its implementation.<\/p> <p> The authority has a range of responsibilities with appointments in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, all of which are specifically regulated either in the Act or statutory instruments, and all of which are different.  For Commissioner and deputy commissioner, our role is to agree the requirements for the jobs with the Minister, to ask the Public Appointments Service to run a selection competition and to nominate one name from that competition to the Government for each position.  Section 9 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act sets this out.<\/p> <p> For the ranks of superintendent to assistant Garda commissioner, inclusive, our role is to undertake competitions ourselves in accordance with regulations and to make appointments to sanctioned positions.  The committee will be aware that previously the competitions were run by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and appointments were made by the Government.  Within the framework of the statutory instrument, the authority set about establishing selection processes which would be as transparent as possible, be confidential, meet the highest standards of fair procedures, be mindful of reports of perceived bias in previous selection processes and be in line with best practice in modern selection practices.  In this context, we also had regard to audit recommendations made by the Commission for Public Service Appointments in 2015.<\/p> <p> The authority set out the governing principles for appointments and its procedures in statements of practice and candidate information booklets which are publicly available.  Copies have been sent to the committee for its information.  Since this function was given to the authority in January this year, three assistant commissioners, six chief superintendents and seven superintendents have been appointed.<\/p> <p> For other Garda ranks, the authority has several places on the promotion advisory council established by the Garda Commissioner.  For civilian appointments at principal and above, we have a role in approving the numbers and job descriptions of such positions.  The recruitment is the responsibility of the Commissioner and it comes back to the authority for appointment.  To date, we have made five appointments ranging from principal to chief administrative officer.  For Civil Service grades below principal, our only role with others, like the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is to approve the numbers and grades.<\/p> <p> I have been made aware in advance that the committee may have some questions about the authority&rsquo;s appointments function.  I know the committee will appreciate that I cannot discuss anything relating to an individual candidate.  I also need to be careful not to say anything which might, even by inference, appear to relate to an individual or to prejudice any future selection processes in which the authority might be involved.<\/p> <p> These opening remarks are intended to give the committee a flavour of three significant areas of activity for the authority.  There are many more and I know the committee will have questions.  However, it is important that I end by underlining that oversight is not an end in itself and it is not a game of gotcha.  It is about enhancing policing performance with a view to ensuring communities are safe, the country is secure and that the people receive the best possible service from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Community confidence and trust in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains strong.  That is a tribute to the work of the women and men in the Garda organisation across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506499200,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feehily for attending the committee again.

In the context of the Government&rsquo;s decision last year to increase the reserve to 2,000 members, it is enormously important there is a proper strategy for engaging, deploying and minding that resource.  It was in the modernisation renewal plan that there would be a strategy and it was marked completed.  It was fairly simple.  We asked for a copy of the strategy.

There does not seem to be an appreciation in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the importance of data for policy making.  Mandatory alcohol testing on a random basis was introduced as a piece of public policy and the outcome from it - to go back to my previous life - is like random tax audits and it informs us of the state of compliance across the community.  It is not about recording negative breath tests, it is about making an assessment for public policy purposes of the state of compliance across the country.  If the negative tests are inflated to such an extent, it completely distorts the assessment of compliance, and that then should feed in turn to deployment decisions regarding targeted check points.  It should also feed into public policy in the Road Safety Authority, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and so on.  The data for this purpose is not about crime statistics, it is about informing public policy.  It is also about giving members of the community the sense that they can be stopped at any time on a random basis and if they are stopped, they will have a mandatory test.

I wanted to touch on some of the points Deputy O'Callaghan made but I note from the Policy Authority's recent report to the Minister that only nine of the 50 recommendations in the Garda Inspectorate's  2015 report, Changing Policing in Ireland, marked as complete and implemented by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under former Commissioner O'Sullivan are regarded as complete by the authority.  I note also that there have been long delays regarding clarification by the former Commissioner of unreliable and incorrectly reclassified homicide statistics.  My understanding is that the authority continues to await clarification from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that there was further delay and frustration regarding the provision of the two recent reports around false breath tests and the wrongful convictions under the fixed charge notices.  Aside from highlighting publicly these most recent issues of non-compliance and non-co-operation and bringing them to the Minister's attention - I note the Ms Feehily has emphasised the value of transparency in recent interviews - and aside from this soft power, it seems the authority has few hard independent powers or sanctions under the current legislation that can be imposed to compel compliance and co-operation and seemingly it has no function in regard to discipline.<\/p>  <p>  Could Ms Feehily list for me and specify any such independent powers under the Act that are available to the authority and provide incidents where she has used them?  For example, has the authority ever referred or considered referring a complaint to Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, in accordance with any of the subsections in section 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended?  Ms Feehily might also confirm whether and when the authority has ever formally requested the assistance of the Minister or the Government by using the stronger legislative powers and sanctions available to the Minister?  For example, did the authority ever recommend to the Minister, in accordance with section 25(1)(a), that the Minister issue an order, or a written directive, to compel the compliance and co-operation of the Garda Commissioner?  If so, will she give details?  If not, why did the authority not recommend that in light of all the above and the intense frustration and impatience of the authority, as per her press releases in the wake of the July meeting?<\/p>  <p>  Did the authority ever request the Minister to provide the authority with statistical crime information regarding homicide, as section 47 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 compels the Garda Commissioner to provide this to the Minister, but not to the authority, every three months, and even upon request?<\/p>  <p>  Will Ms Feehily confirm, whether in her report to the Minister, in accordance with section 62 which must be submitted before January 2018, she will be requesting any further independent powers or compulsion, sanction and discipline functions to strengthen the effectiveness of what is currently the weak legislative capacity of the authority to independently oversee a clearly unco-operative and non-compliant police force?<\/p>  <p>  Given that the Commissioner remains solely and rightly accountable to the Minister only, and not to the authority, in accordance with section 26, and given that the Government alone has the power to remove a Garda Commissioner, in accordance with section 11, although it must notify the authority in this regard if a proposed removal relates to policing, will Ms Feehily confirm if the authority ever used or considered using its power, in accordance with section 11, to recommend to the Government that the Garda Commissioner be removed, and if any discussions were held either internally in the authority or with the Department that would come within section 11?  This question arises as much with respect to the conduct of the former Garda Commissioner, referred to above, and much of the language in the recent press releases issued by the Policing Authority regarding trust and confidence.  It appears to reflect the threshold for removal required by section 11.  If the authority did not recommend or consider recommending removal to the authority, why did it not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700004#C00800","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1506499800,"counter":747,"content":"<p>Members can choose to ask individual questions, although Deputy Wallace has asked a group of questions.

I will first take a few that can be dealt with quickly.  We received the report on homicide data in the past couple of days and I will be bringing it to the authority meeting tomorrow.  We now have a report.<\/p>  <p>  To take the totality of our frustration at the delay, the data quality and that group of questions together, the questions relating to homicide data, the mandatory alcohol testing, MAT report and so on, I was struck by the remarks in Kathleen O'Toole's letter, which we would share, about management capacity.  She references engagement with us in her letter.  I am still not sure to what extent some of these issues are down to non-compliance or just poor capacity at management level.  Until one could bottom that out, the question of deciding that one wanted to make any kind of approach to a Minister would not arise.  We are very much at the stage of working through this; our third report was quite shrill, it is the shrillest.  We were working, as I said in my opening statement, in a framework of setting targets, measuring them and saying why did they not do it, and moving along in a methodical way.  We came to that report, which was quite shrill.  Any consideration of what one might do next such as approaching the Minister to compel was something that would have been in the future.  We certainly have not got there yet.  We have discussed before the parameters of our power and I do not disagree with anything the Deputy has said in that regard.   <\/p>  <p>  As regards the question of the GSOC, we certainly did consider, on a number of occasions at official level, whether they were items to refer to GSOC but it emerged that the items before us, to my recollection, have all already been to GSOC and it was clear from the material that came into us that GOSC was already seized of them.  Therefore, the need for a formal referral did not arise, but we certainly looked at a number of cases from that point of view to satisfy ourselves that they were already with GSOC and that we did not need to formally send them.<\/p> <p>Those are answers to some of the questions.<\/p> <p> The authority has yet to consider its two-year report in any detail.  There is also a procedural point, in that the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland has been asked to review the whole firmament of oversight and accountability.  We will make a submission to the commission on that point as well as every other point in its terms of reference.  I imagine that the two-year report to the Minister and the submission to the commission will end up being a package.  I am pretty certain that we will be making some observations about our powers, but we have not yet decided what they will be.  I am certain that we will be making some observations about some of the recruitment confusion that I outlined in my opening statement between different processes for every level.  We will be noting the accountability ambiguity - let us put it that way - that is in the legislation and needs to be attended to.  However, the authority has not yet come to a view on the content of the report.<\/p> <p> Regarding section 11, and as any oversight body would, we made sure to understand the parameters of the various sections of our Act.  To that extent, we had a conversation about whether we knew what the section meant.  However, the authority has never sat down for a formal consideration in a particular instance of the use of section 11.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700004#C01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506500400,"counter":752,"content":"<p>According to section 11(1), the threshold for the removal of a Garda Commissioner is if the individual \"has failed to perform the functions of the office with due diligence and effectiveness or, in the case of the Garda Commissioner, has failed to have regard to any of the matters specified in section 26(2),\" including not having regard to priorities, performance targets, the policing plan, the strategy statement or the policing principles and failing to comply with a directive.  According to the authority's statements at press conferences, the Commissioner failed in this regard and was not fulfilling her duties in the manner expected of her.  Ms Feehily is saying that this might be a matter for the future and raised the question of whether it was down to the Commissioner, a lack of resources or the management structure, but the Commissioner was the boss.  She was not haranguing the Government for more resources for this, that or the other without which she could not do her job properly.  She told us that she was doing her job properly.  Clearly, she was not.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to touch on a point that Deputy O'Callaghan raised about the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and the authority.  Public statements by the Minister and the Taoiseach give the impression that the authority will pick the new Commissioner, but my reading of the legislation - much like Deputy O'Callaghan's - is that the authority will be on the sideline.  Under section 9 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, the procedure seems to require the authority to get approval from the Government in writing before inviting the PAS to conduct a competition for the selection of the new Commissioner.  Once the authority gets the Minister's approval, it agrees with the PAS the marking criteria that will be used by the interview board when the PAS conducts the competition.  However, subsection (5) reads: \"The Service shall provide the Authority with particulars of the experience, qualifications, training and expertise of a person whom it recommends for nomination by the Authority under subsection (1) for appointment as the Garda Commissioner.\"  My reading of this is that the PAS provides the authority with one name only and effectively runs the competition, makes the final choice and provides that name to the authority.  The authority then nominates that person to the Government, which appoints him or her formally, if it so chooses.  The important body appears to be the PAS.  Although the Departments of Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform each have a representative on the PAS board, the Policing Authority does not.<\/p>  <p>  The authority's role in the selection of the Commissioner is minimal.  If the above is accurate, the authority's role has been overplayed by the Minister and the Taoiseach.  Does Ms Feehily agree with me?<\/p>  <p>  In addition to confirming the authority's interpretation and understanding of the process, will Ms Feehily outline who decides who will sit on the PAS interview board?  Does she have the opportunity to sit on it?  Mr. Martin Fraser sat on it previously on behalf of the Government, including to select the former Commissioner.  How many individuals will sit on the new board and will a simple vote among them decide the selection?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700005#D00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506500400,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I wish to address a couple of points.  To clarify, some of the Deputy's quotations about marking schemes and so on are not in the Act.  I have discussed the broad shape that he described with Deputy O'Callaghan.  We have significant responsibility in terms of determining the specification for the role, but Deputy Wallace is right, in that we hand the process over to the PAS to run the competition.  That is what the statute says.  There is no other way of interpreting it.  The PAS runs the competition within the framework of its Act and determines who will sit on the selection board.  However, the authority is clear, in that we would expect detailed engagement about the composition of the board and the processes that the PAS will use in order for us to be satisfied that it is a valid competition.  I see this working in a collaborative way.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Justice and Equality being represented on the board.  Unless he is referring to the board of the PAS, no discussion of any description has taken place about the composition of an interview panel.  After the letter that we received today from Ms Kathleen O'Toole, we are still a long way away from having any conversation about the composition of the interview panel.

In that context, I would be concerned if Ms Feehily does not have a clear idea already of what suggested changes will be contained in the authority's submission to the Government.  Will the authority be seeking substantially more independence?  How would that fit in with the new commission on policing, which seems to have come out of nowhere to take over roles - completely unnecessarily in many ways, given that the answers were already available - that are established in law?  Will that create a difficulty for the authority in submitting its review?

Is the authority considering ideas along those lines?  How far advanced is it in that regard?<\/p> <p>Does the authority now see the commission as an interference?

Before the summer break we assigned several members of staff to start the process of interviewing each authority member to gather their views on each of those questions and on all the sections in the Act.  This is in order that we can have a draft prepared that the authority can consider as a whole.  I am quite satisfied we will both have and express views on the constraints in the Act under a number of headings.  I do not quite know what those collective views are just yet.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I connected this to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is that we must also issue a submission to that commission, so I suspect the product might serve two purposes.  That is the connection I see there.  I am certainly on the record as saying at the Committee of Public Accounts recently that I thought we in the authority should have a stronger role in the areas of resourcing, deployment, budgets and so forth.  That is something we have said.  I mentioned the other issues.  Recruitment is very awkward because it is different for every rank.  The ambiguity over accountability does not help.  When we are considering something, we have to read the Act as a whole, and it may well be the case that the answer is not to empower us in the authority but perhaps to empower the Minister instead, and commentators have made that point.  Ambiguity and confusion do not help.  We will be raising points like this, but precisely how we will come down in the end is a matter on which the authority as a whole has to take a view.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Wallace with regard to the commission, by the way, as does the Policing Authority as a whole.  All the reports of the inspectorate are very good but the two major reports, the one on crime investigation and the one on changing policing, together provide an enormously useful blueprint.  That is why we are very rigorous about following the changing policing report and establishing whether this or that has been done.  We will keep doing that, the commission notwithstanding.  The commission has considerable value to add from two points of view.  First, and I have found this to be true myself and I think the committee will appreciate it, the Policing Authority landed out of nowhere.  It did not have the value of, for example, the Patten commission in Northern Ireland.  When the authority is asked to explain why this model was chosen over any other model, it is very hard to find analysis of this other than in Oireachtas debates and speeches.  It would be very useful if a body of work were carried out to set down the rationale behind the model, whatever that model might be, for policing, oversight, security and so on.  There are any number of models globally, all of them valid, as it depends on the problem one is trying to solve.  That would be a useful piece of work to see.<\/p>  <p>  I would also very much like to see the commission address a number of big existential questions that have never really been examined.  One is the policing security split and the other is the issue of democratic accountability.  No analysis has been done of these questions.  We also have joint policing committees of a particular type.  Are they strong enough?  Is that where accountability should lie?  Should it be local as opposed to national?  The commission could contribute real work that no one has examined to date in any kind of academic or analytical way.  I am optimistic that the commission will add real value and an enhanced policy basis for some of the choices to be made with regard to policing oversight.  I am also quite sure that what will emerge at the end will be a different Policing Authority, however different, but certainly different in some respects.  I see the commission as having value to add in these terms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1506501000,"counter":761,"content":"<p>Limited as the legislation is, I would have thought the authority could have done more in some areas and I want to home in on some of those now.

It has been well established that to transform the culture inside the force, one needs to look at appointments at all levels.  This point was made by Mr. Conor Brady.  In that context, how much of an emphasis does the authority place on complaints in the system against people who are on promotion lists?  The old Garda charter, which predates the authority and is still in place as far as I know, states that it is the duty of officers to make it known if someone on a promotion list is suspected or guilty of conduct making them unsuitable for that promotion.  This committee brought some information to the authority regarding concerns over some people on that list who were also under investigation.  How is this matter treated?  What is the authority's situation there?  The committee is aware that the authority received correspondence this week from the solicitor of one of the Garda whistleblowers asking whether the authority might have considered a situation whereby a complaint is made against an officer who is due on a promotion list.  That person might be management's favoured candidate and a system would kick in that would allow that complaint to be lost or sidelined, so that if the question was asked whether that person was under investigation or the subject of any disciplinary procedure, the answer would be no, even though that might in fact technically be the case.  Have the authority members considered a scenario in which the wool might be pulled over their eyes in this way?  This was the issue put to the authority, particularly in the context of the seriousness of promotions with regard to shaking up how the system operates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700006#E00900","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506501000,"counter":768,"content":"<p>First, I apologise for any outstanding correspondence.

It is eight months since his report came out.  He made suggestions regarding the changes that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na need to implement and could implement in many instances straight away.  His suggestions concerned the templates, mandatory PULSE reporting and so on.

Our own work regarding children had begun very much earlier as a themed piece of work in our policing committee supported by my colleague, Ms Tumelty.  In that regard, the Policing Authority at committee level had had deep engagement with the Garda regarding how children are treated as suspects and as victims.  The section 12 piece was only a subset of that and was a much broader-ranging discussion.  My colleagues met the Children's Rights Alliance and the Ombudsman for Children, so we had a much broader engagement.  We did seek an advance copy of Dr. Shannon's report but were not able to get one.  That might have informed our planning earlier in the year.  We got it literally the day before it was published, the same as everyone else.  By then, the committee was already engaged with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the totality of its approach to working with children as victims and suspects.  What we are doing now with Dr. Shannon's report is the same as what we are doing with all the other reports: we have taken the recommendations, we have built them into our performance framework and we will ask the Garda periodically what it has done about them.

The Policing Authority's brief is to oversee systems and principles, and children is a key one on which he has done the work where there would not be that level of liaison between the Policing Authority and the Garda.  That is what I am finding hard to grapple with all the questions.  The same goes for the promotions.  The Act makes it clear that the Policing Authority has a responsibility to keep itself informed of complaints against members of the Garda, for example, and how disciplinary procedures are being applied, but Ms Feehily seems to put a distance there as well.

They are positive.  There was no evidence of racial profiling.

The same newspaper reported a case of a woman who suffered the ignominy of being arrested at her home and was sent to Limerick Prison.  In the context of the process the Garda have set out, which is largely administrative, and its apology and commitment to reimburse people for the fines, does Ms Feehily believe the process is adequate, given the fact there are people who have clearly suffered far more serious consequences and would potentially have a much stronger case for more substantial compensation or redress?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700008#G01200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506502200,"counter":797,"content":"<p>I will take the questions in order.  We get periodic reports from the Garda following Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's report.  The next one about what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing about discipline is not due yet.  We are aware in a general way but I am not aware in any detailed way about it.  Last March the authority expressed our serious alarm and dismay about this whole issue.  We saw it as an integrity and huge public confidence issue and I am struck by the fact it has connected with the public in a way that some other issues to do with the garda&iacute; have not because it is so widespread.  We never approached it from the point of view of discipline.  That is not our focus.  Discipline in the Garda, as in many other areas, is regulated by statute and is the responsibility of the Commissioner.  From my own experience and background in HR, discipline in the context of something as widespread as this is a very tricky issue.  I am not sure how it will proceed or how successful it could be.<\/p>  <p>  The authority is particularly concerned about the remarks of the GRA.  At one level, when I heard them my reaction was it is a pity it did not say it sooner because there was an inherent admission about the numbers which would have advanced us all a couple of months, whatever about the context.  Evidence of duress would be very important to be brought forward and in that context I imagine the authority would be keen to see disciplinary action in those situations.  The company we have engaged to do this work for us has invited the GRA to come and meet it.  I am not sure if that has happened or if it will happen.  The work schedule plans engagement with all of the staff associations including the GRA.  I agree with the Deputy that it is a serious allegation and it needs to be stood up before anything can be done about it.<\/p> <p> The broader question of impact beyond just a conviction that can be appealed for the fixed charge notices is something the authority put on the Garda agenda as long ago as last March.  We pointed out the Garda would need to think very seriously about those broader impacts on people who may have lost their livelihood or licence, and be prepared for actions that might be taken against it.

Do the witnesses feel the Policing Authority is being used to outsource responsibility and accountability by the Government when perhaps, from what the witnesses said to us, they are not necessarily exercising the legislative powers they might have?  Do they feel there is a circular approach here where there are so many organisations around policing now that everybody is passing the buck?  Do the witnesses believe there is accountability anywhere at senior levels across all elements between the Government and the public service?  For example, when Deputy Clare Daly asked about the Garda Commissioner, the witness said that the Garda Commissioner has personal accountability to the Minister, while in the legislative area there is mention of accountability links with the Policing Authority.<\/p>  <p>  I have a concern that there is a circular issue here where everybody is passing the buck.

When issues regarding the Garda are raised in the D&aacute;il we regularly hear the Government say that it has established the Policing Authority and that the work is ongoing there.  Does the authority feel that the current policing architecture matches that political speech or does it feel that it is being scapegoated or being thrown an outsourced responsibility when, perhaps, on a legislative basis it might not have that responsibility?

I have no problem with that, but accountability of the Garda Commissioner is explicit.  That is the only point I was making earlier.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of what we have added, I have spoken before about something in which I really do believe, namely, the soft power of transparency.  I believe that the arrival of the Policing Authority has been hugely significant both for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality in the sense that we have set out measures in a policing plan and have measured that.  We have done stuff every month.  We have had public meetings and published reports.  There is an evolution there that was just absent in terms of rigour and follow-up.  With the best will in the world, neither the Department, the Minister nor this committee will be engaging with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the way we are.  I think that is the change breaker or the context changer.  When we set out our work programme for this year, for example, we would have advised An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in December that we were planning to have a public meeting about roads policing in April.  One can question what would have happened if we had not done that.  We had already identified the issue about checkpoints and the issues around the data in our committee sessions.  The evolution of transparency has been hugely beneficial and the authority has played its part in that.<\/p>  <p>  We have the framework and we think we have a contribution to make within that framework.  We see it as an evolving work in progress.  We will have views about where it should go next.

I also particularly liked Ms Feehily's point that the bar has to be set very high.  Unfortunately, in a lot of instances, people put the bar very low when they engage in the game of \"Gotcha\".

There seems to be a functional inability to deliver management whether in training, in performance or in the type of standard outputs that one would expect from a management team.  That links to my previous question in that I believe much of that is what led to the whole problem we faced.  The GRA is going down a slightly different route and has made a very serious allegation.

That work will be beginning shortly.  We are just going to be looking at the governance across the top of the organisation because it would be a <i>magnum opus<\/i>to do the whole governance piece.  We are going to look at that in a fairly objective way.  I am also struck by the echoes in Ms O'Toole's letter about management capacity.  I do not think she is talking about the capacity of individuals, and neither am I.  I am talking about the capacity of the management system.  To that extent, I do not disagree with Deputy Brophy.  The other issue that comes into play is culture.<\/p> <p>About June of last year the authority called on the Garda to conduct a culture audit, which had been recommended sometime previously by an inspectorate report.  That is finally now under way.  If one does not get an independent benchmark of culture then one cannot measure progress.  Culture is enormously powerful in all organisations.  In a disciplined force with a long tradition and its own ways of working the culture, as management books say, can eat strategy and everything else very easily.  We are putting a lot of emphasis on making sure that the culture audit is not delayed.  Comments about Garda culture have been made in the past by a number of Commissions of Investigation, a number of commentators and, indeed, the inspectorate.  The Garda has been inclined to disown them.  Therefore, it is very important an objective piece of work is done that involves focus groups, and input by individual members, so that we can say, \"This is what you said about your culture\" and then see where that takes us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700011#K01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506504600,"counter":861,"content":"<p>I fully accept what the chairperson has said.

I would have expressed the view to them, which I think is recorded in the report, that the structure that has been put in place in the legislation, which separates policing from security, could, if it was considered appropriate, provide a basis for protecting the security of the State in the context of the right to strike.  That was really the question asked by the group.  In terms of the big question of whether it should happen, I think the ILO or the Council of Europe had already opined on this matter and it seemed to me at that time that the working group had a very strong piece of information.  I have not read the group's rationale as to why it went from there down to a conclusion on the right to strike.<\/p>  <p>  There are huge risks and concerns to public confidence if the Garda strike lightly.  The security aspect is absolutely clear.  In my view the security of the State does require certain essential elements of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be unable to strike and after that it is a matter of judgment.  In other parts of Europe where there is more than one police service, some police services have the right to strike and some do not.  It is a matter of judgment.  So long as we have a unitary service it is a very difficult issue.  The report, it seems to me, says one has the right to strike if one is at one's desk but not in other instances.  My answer to the commission was very much around if it is a unitary service than the situation is particularly problematic.  If the decision to separate happened then there might be a different way to approach the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700012#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1506504600,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I can see what the chairperson is saying.

In many countries the police service has been sanitised over the past number of decades.  The original purpose of those security services was something that we would never like here.  I would never be of the view that we should split An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into anything like that.

I found both of the presentations very informative but, at points, I also found them astounding.  The reason I say so is exactly the same as what I said to the delegation on the last occasion.  It is because of my experience, as an elective representative previously in the North, and my engagement with policing structures and policing oversight bodies that are by no means perfect but are very different.  Ms Feehily mentioned in her contribution the importance and significance of transparency, with which I agree, that instils important cultural changes into any organisation.  For me, while transparency is critical, the other aspect must be accountability.  When we operate within a culture and ethos that has emerged over the past number of years, it does a huge disservice to the small incremental cultural changes that Ms Feehily referenced when there is not that level of both political and independent democratic oversight.  In terms of some of things that I have heard, I find it incomprehensible that those proactive accountability mechanisms have not yet been put in place in this State.  Given that we are not operating albeit in terms of the legacy that Deputy Brophy spoke about, we do not have the same complex history that policing in the North had in terms of its transformation over the past number of years.  The biggest dynamic in that change was the injection of an international and independent review from top to bottom.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brophy mentioned that quiet work is important, which is much like the point made by Ms Feehily.  I agree quiet work is very important behind the scenes, and I have been involved in some of that around some of the outstanding policing issues in the North at a community level.  So, too, is big, bold, political leadership initiatives that have transformed some of the negatives.  I do not say so to be glib.  I appreciate that I have been on a bit more of a soapbox, rather than asking specific questions.  Ms Feehily has already been asked a number of comprehensive questions.  However, it was important to state that there needs to be a political transformation that empowers, emboldens and most of all enables an oversight body, like the Policing Authority, to deliver accountability and tangible results for people who expect a policing service of the highest standard in the first instance. <\/p>  <p>  I have a brief question on the security aspect that Ms Feehily touched on very early in her presentation.  Are there practical ways in which that aspect has impacted or inhibited the work of the Policing Authority?

For the record, the Fine Gael-Labour Government gave her that one.<\/p>  <p>  I was amused by Deputy Brophy's point about low bars and high bars.  It is a bit like pole vaulting.  Fine Gael puts it low when it suits it and high when it suits it also. <\/p>  <p>  On the Public Appointments Service, PAS, board, I was making the point that there is a representative from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Public Expenditure on the board.  The Policing Authority does not have anyone on the board.  I know none of the board will be sitting on the interview panel but they have the power to oversee how the interview panel is structured and how it operates.  The question should have been to ask Ms Feehily if she believed the Government has actually more say than her in the selection panel?<\/p>  <p>  Ms Feehily raised the code of ethics.  Credit is due to her to get that across the line in December or January but I see from the minutes of the code of ethics committee on 13 March 2017 that there have been difficulties in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's attitude to embedding the code, for example, where Garda documents included the code as a spoke in the wheel of a diagram of decision making rather than its centre.  Nine months have passed since then but does Ms Feehily know if all garda&iacute; have received a personal copy of the code and initial training in applying it in their daily working lives?<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste launched it in January 2017 but she did not publicise the fact at the time that several weeks previously, the Government had chosen to quietly enact a statutory instrument, SI 639\/2016 during the Christmas 2016 D&aacute;il vacation which downgraded and seriously undermined the effect of the code of ethics.  This statutory instrument confirms that breach of the code of ethics can no longer be considered a breach of the disciplinary regulations 2007.  What effect does the code of ethics have now?

They have their own statutory framework.  The Deputy is correct about the make-up of the interview panel in that it is the responsibility of PAS, but I am quite satisfied from my previous engagement - I am around public administration a long time - that we have always managed to engage constructively in terms of how it would run competitions for me in any job I ever had, but the Deputy is correct.  It takes place within its framework and under its board.<\/p>  <p>  There are three or four points about the code of ethics.  If I could go backwards, and I am not speaking for the authority because as I keep saying, we have not yet considered the content of our two-year report.<\/p> <p>I would be surprised if we made the request to which the Deputy referred because it was considered very carefully, thoroughly and deliberately by the authority.  I cannot remember if the T&aacute;naiste drew attention to it at the launch but I did so in my opening remarks then where I spoke about the model chosen being one of commitment rather than compliance.  I do not think one can force ethics.  It is a cultural question.  All modern people management and HR practices have moved from a compliance culture to a commitment culture.  One must get engagement and commitment.  Ethics is about what people do when no one is looking.  A discipline code is no good if there is no one looking.  The authority made a very conscious decision on this and we engaged widely, receiving many submissions on the matter.  We had expert presentations, and a whole day of public meetings with interested bodies.  <\/p> <p> Lest I be misunderstood, the behaviour that is a breach of the code of ethics in itself may well be a breach of the discipline code.  The behaviour is subject to discipline but it is not the notion that a breach of the code is subject to discipline, it is the behaviour which ought to be disciplined and that remains subject to discipline within the disciplinary regulations.  That was a deliberate model chosen by the authority.  The best example I can give is if someone did something that is unethical, for instance in how he or she engaged with a victim, that in itself is subject to discipline, but not because it is in the code of ethics.  It is the behaviour that should be disciplined, rather than the breach of the code.  I doubt we will revisit that between now and December.  We only published it in January.  It is specifically stated on page 5 of the code that we made that choice.   <\/p> <p> Regarding the Deputy's point about the minutes of the meeting in March, I return to my point about transparency.  The fact we publish all our minutes gives an insight into the work that we are delighted to provide.  I can confirm that that meeting did lead to a fairly robust engagement which has altered the model.  It is no longer a spoke in a broader model, or however we wrote it in the minutes, it is a piece of work in its own right.  The embedding plan is now well developed; we have not signed off on it yet.  The first instalment of it was the supply of copies and the swearing that happened last Friday for the new recruits.  They are approaching the embedding from both ends.  There will be bespoke training for the senior team and simultaneously it will be embedded in the training for all new recruits.  Gradually, it will be rolled out to groups in the middle over time.  I think we have it back on track but I can assure the Deputy that we are very focussed on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700013#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506505800,"counter":877,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feehily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700014#N00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1506505800,"counter":878,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feehily and Deputy Wallace.<\/p><p>I have some questions myself.  I am minded of Senator Conway's dogs on the street.  It is apparent to me, and I think other members will concur, that there is a universal view on the situation around breath tests and the falsification of the numbers carried out, that because of its universality - it did not present in a district or region, it was right across every Garda district - that could not and would not happen unless there was some direction from on high.  It is not something that happened sporadically and broke out where in the course of carrying out their duties, garda&iacute; decided to bump up the numbers.  They were clearly acting under direction.  From what level of seniority could such a direction issue?  At what level within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must it have been known that this was happening, not after the event, but either through initiation or while it was being conducted?  That has given rise to serious concerns about the operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to the question of breath tests and other matters.  It is very serious.<\/p><p>Ms Feehily's report is currently under construction but it is not only Senator Conway's dogs on the street, of which I must be one, but also the spokesperson for the Garda Representative Association who, in what was certainly an unusual interview, put it firmly on the record on behalf of the GRA that its members were directed.  I know that we are all concerned, and the committee has spoken of this collectively and individually on the matter.  It is a very serious matter.  I believe, and say so as chair of this committee, that knowledge of this went to the very top and not after its exposure but as it was in train.  I would like Ms Feehily to comment on that.<\/p><p>My second and last question is as follows.  The special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, appeared before the committee last week and I have heard Ms Feehily's response.  I listened very carefully to the exchange with members.  I cannot quote back exactly as she replied, but to paraphrase, she said that in January Dr. Shannon had signed off on the audit that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had commissioned him to carry out in relation to section 12 of the Childcare Act 1991.  I appreciate that the reported was presented to the authority not by Dr. Shannon but presumably by the office of the Garda Commissioner last May, so Ms Feehily would not have had the same time as others to examine it.  Ms Feehily indicated that amidst everything else which was presenting at that time, that audit was not the number 1 priority to be addressed.  Nevertheless, the importance of this report cannot be relegated.  Last week, Dr. Shannon very clearly conveyed to the committee that the PULSE system, as it currently functions, is unfit for purpose in terms of data recording and ensuring that there is a proper record of all instances where section 12 powers are used.  They are huge powers.  We referred to the 31 cases during earlier exchanges but the inadequacies of the PULSE system were referred to and applied across the several hundred cases which were under Dr. Shannon's scrutiny in the period he was examining the system.  <\/p><p>Is it the case that there is so much presenting at the moment?  If there was not, I would have expected that the Policing Authority from May to now, the end of September, would have taken appropriate steps.  As a former spokesperson on children, and some of my colleagues here have held similar responsibilities in the past, I am greatly concerned that the report's audit and findings on the PULSE system is not being acted on with the speed with which it should and must.  Is it the case that the Policing Authority as currently resourced is feeling the weight of all that is now presenting <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that sadly, as a consequence, this very important report and its findings is not getting the attention and action it deserves?  I ask Ms Feehily to reply to both parts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700014#N00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506505800,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I may have given the wrong impression regarding the children.

I thought that was to their credit.<\/p>  <p>  The themes in the report were themes the authority was already engaged with.  We did not sit down and say \"today we are doing Dr. Shannon's report\".  For example, as long ago as probably last November in public session we were asking the garda&iacute; about their application of children first guidelines and we commented negatively on the incomplete training of Garda members for interviewing children.  We had been coming at themes that are echoed in Dr. Shannon's report starting at the end of last year.  <\/p>  <p>  The question about PULSE sits in our work on data quality.  He is absolutely correct that there are deficiencies in the data on PULSE.  We have been dealing with that as a data theme for over a year.  PULSE is an acronym but it is a piece of technology.  The data deficiencies are to do with what is put on PULSE.  Sometimes PULSE is used as a catchall term but most of the data quality issues that we have noticed, and which it seems to me Dr. Shannon is outing, have to do with the quality of the information that is put into the system.  If I gave the impression that we are not exercised about those issues it is simply that in our work they have been under way for some time under the headings of engagement with children and data quality.  In respect of the specific set of recommendations, we have placed Dr. Shannon's report on the agenda for our public meeting tomorrow to get a progress report from the garda&iacute; on each of those.  We are very mindful of the content and I am sorry if I gave a different impression but we did not do it through the lens of the report but through the themes of children and data quality.  In that regard we very much share his concerns.  We also did it through the lens of training.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the alcohol tests, as I indicated earlier, the work is well advanced and the sense we are getting from the company doing the work for us is that it is likely to report that there was an implicit expectation in connection with breath tests rather than an explicit direction.  It is difficult to imagine an organisation having such a discrepancy in numbers without knowledge existing throughout the organisation.  It is difficult to conceive that there would not have been knowledge at various levels throughout the organisation.  To return to the point I made when I was discussing managerial capacity with Deputy Brophy, and whether this data mattered that I discussed with Deputy O'Callaghan, I have a sense that it is not an organisation that looks at numbers and says if we do this many breath tests, and we have this many garda&iacute; and there are only this many people with licences and that is the managerial capacity point.  I suspect we will get indications from Crowe Horwath of a belief throughout the organisation that certain performance was expected but it is unlikely to find a directive or a direction.  I still think the contribution from the Garda Representative Association, GRA, if it can produce evidence of it, will help us to close that circle.  I have a thing in my head that someday somebody put 2 million breath tests on a website without saying hold on, there are not that many driving licences.  There is not that way of thinking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700015#O00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1506506400,"counter":883,"content":"<p>There will be much incredulity if the fine line is between implicit expectation as against explicit direction and if that is the last word on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092700015#O00500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506506400,"counter":884,"content":"<p>We will see when we have the report and the authority will make its own views known, based on the research that is done.
