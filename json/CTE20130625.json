This industry is very important to the Gaeltacht and coastal communities, particularly along the west coast.  We are the forgotten people of Ireland and we feel our industry has been a scapegoat over the years and forgotten about.  The situation is getting worse and we are hopeful that something can be done about it.<\/p><p>  We have several aims and objectives, the first of which is to maintain a sustainable future for the commercial, inshore under ten metres sector.  In order to do this, we need access to all of the stocks.  We have been banned from fishing many stocks, which puts pressure on the shellfish.  There is a need for very aggressive conservation and rejuvenation programmes in certain areas.  For example, there is a conservation programme in place with the V-notching of lobsters, but we feel there is a far better way of conserving these stocks by allowing the females to breed in hatcheries and putting the juvenile fish out to sea, back to their natural habitat.  Tests are being done on this at the moment and the breeding success rate is up to 20% better than with V-notching.  We believe this method should be used for both lobsters and crayfish.<\/p><p>  We need an industry-led cohesive management plan to ensure sustainable supplies.  In that context, we are calling for the setting up of a central fisheries management board, with five fishermen from this sector on that board.  Proper marketing is another key issue because at the moment, the lobster and shellfish market is at an all-time low.  The European market is not the place to be going with much of the catch.  There is a large amount of lobster being imported from outside the EU which is affecting the price.  There are many other markets to be exploited.  Lobsters can be dry-packed now and sent on within a few hours of being caught.  The development of markets outside of Europe is vital but cannot happen unless a proper management structure is put in place.  We feel that the system that has been in place for the last 30 years has not worked, unfortunately.  There are many problems in our industry but no one is listening.  Solutions must be found through collaboration.<\/p><p>  The development of new management structures must be industry led and all stakeholders must be consulted.  The central fisheries board that we are seeking would co-ordinate the management of the inshore sector.  This could be done by regional committees advising the board of problems in certain areas.  The approach must be adaptable and flexible and must not be a heavy-handed one.  A streamlining of the licensing in the commercial sector is needed.  The marketing and labelling of fish is very important.  Labels must include information on where the fish is caught and by which vessels.  We also need clearly defined rules and regulations regarding seasonal entitlements and so forth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013062500003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon O'Corcora","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372167000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Uasal &Oacute; Corcora as an cur i l&aacute;thair iontach at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige.

T&aacute; a fhios acu si&uacute;d a bhfuil ag obair sa tionscal go bhfuil s&eacute; deacair go leor sl&iacute; beatha a bhaint amach.  It is very difficult to make a living in the industry to pay one's bills, cover one's mortgage costs, run one's car and put one's family through school and college.  There are 4,500 people involved in it.  Mr. &Oacute; Corcora has identified some of the simple policy steps the State could take and which would not cost it one penny.  It is a good idea to provide for regional management structures that would lead to a more localised decision-making process, or more localised input by fishermen in local regions.  My understanding is that the fishing sector in different regions and different parts of the country is dealing with different issues.  It is obvious that the whitefish issue is a major one in the southern region.  As Mr. &Oacute; Corcora has identified, salmon and lobster issues are arising in the northern region.<\/p><p>  The ban on salmon fishing was a major blow to the inshore sector.  It was obviously introduced by a Minister from my own party, Mr. Noel Dempsey, and was a fatal blow.  The angling fraternity put huge pressure on the then Minister to consider the moneys that could be generated from angling tourism and there was documentation flying around everywhere in support of this.  However, those moneys have not emerged.  I accept that there was an issue at sea.  Drift-netting may have been depleting salmon stocks, but there were other factors also.  Mr. &Oacute; Corcora has identified some of them, including the issue of seals waiting in bays and eating salmon as they come in and again on the way out.  There were other issues relating to spawning grounds in rivers, poaching and pollution.  Local authorities were playing a major part in the pollution of rivers.  However, only one issue was dealt with - the banning of drift-netting.  None of the other issues was dealt with, which was a mistake.<\/p><p>  When Dr. Alyne Delaney appeared before the committee, she said there were 250,000 to 300,000 salmon in the north Atlantic and suggested salmon fishing could be sustainable if it were reopened on a pilot basis.  I think Mr. &Oacute; Corcora is highlighting that point about sustainability also.  Other things such as a seal cull also have to be considered.  I would be in favour of a seal cull around the coast.  Obviously, Inland Fisheries Ireland is looking at rivers and spawning grounds and dealing with pollution control and poaching, etc.  All of that needs to happen, but there also needs to be an opportunity.  If that is not done, lobster stocks will become depleted.  That is happening because too much pressure is being placed on one or two areas.<\/p><p>  I am very keen for the committee to emphasise to the Minister that there is an alternative way of doing this.  Those involved in Inland Fisheries Ireland which is responsible for salmon fishing might not agree.  I have the highest regard for Dr. Ciaran Byrne, the chief executive officer of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  We have to be able to show scientifically that this industry can operate again and some work may need to be done to show this.  I suggest it be done on a pilot basis for three or five years, after which we can reflect on the matter.  The salmon ban should have been introduced over two, three or four years, after which it should have been reviewed, but that is not what happened.  A blanket ban was introduced, which was wrong.  The rationale behind its introduction does not stand up.  I certainly do not see thousands of tourist anglers coming to County Donegal to catch salmon in our rivers.  Bed and breakfast accommodation, the hotels and restaurants are not seeing these tourists either.  It was a false claim.<\/p><p>  Mr. &Oacute; Corcora has mentioned that a change will have to be made with regard to pot licensing.  His document refers to the need to study the UK model.  Is there anything there we should be considering?  Are there recommendations we should be examining?  Mr. &Oacute; Corcora can respond to these questions when he is summing up.  I am not familiar with what has been proposed in the United Kingdom, but he might be able to enlighten us.  <\/p><p>  I could go into much more detail on some of the recommendations made by Mr. &Oacute; Corcora.  I agree with the vast majority of what he said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013062500006#F00200","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372167600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Corcora and Mr. Connolly for the presentation.  It is good to have people representing not just vested interests in fishing but the communities they come from.  The IIE effectively does that, representing the largest number of people involved in the sector.  They all come from the coastal communities most affected by the prevailing policies and the lack of policy to ensure fishermen, their families and their communities can survive.  Regrettably, successive Governments have done the complete opposite.  In reading the presentation, I thought it was an affront to democracy that neither the previous Government nor the current Government has met the organisation.  It is an indictment of the political system that this is the case.  Some 4,500 people involved in the sector are effectively voiceless when it comes to decision-making processes.  They are not being listened to and have no voice at the table.<\/p><p>  I come from further up the same bay as Mr. O'Corcora and I grew up in the same environment of small farming and fishing communities with multiple fishing types throughout the year.  There was potting in the early part of the year, salmon in the summer and oysters in the winter.  This was replicated along the west coast and parts of the south coast.  There was also small farming in order to provide sustainable incomes for people in the community.  These were vibrant communities because people were community-orientated, not individualistic.  Successive Governments have made a point about how progressive some fishermen are.  The fact that 23 people own the entire quota is an indictment of the political system.<\/p><p>  I was on the committee while an industry was taken from rural communities.  People from different political persuasions, including Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers, spoke against what Noel Dempsey was doing.  They were forced by the Whip to vote for what was done, which was a disgrace.  Senator Denis O'Donovan, who was a Deputy at the time and is from west Cork, was totally opposed to what was happening.<\/p><p>  Taking the salmon industry from our community had a terrible effect and put pressure on other sectors within fishing.  In order to maintain a sustainable income, people switched over to crayfish, gillnetting and lobster fishing, putting extra pressure on the area.  With regard to the number of pots people can fish on our coast, a regular-sized fishing person who is fishing crayfish and lobster pots has up to 900 pots.  Twenty years ago, 150 pots was a sizeable amount of gear.  Now, one must multiply it by five or six in order to have a sustainable income.  I wish decision makers could see how difficult it is for people to survive.  One of my best friends is a selector on the same football team as me.  He is a crewman on a boat and he has hauled 600 pots for less than &euro;50 for the day.  He was out from 4 a.m. until 12 midnight for less than &euro;50 in order to put bread on the table for his family.  That is what the system and the State have done to people like the witnesses.  I applaud them for coming here and everything they have said makes sense.  The decision-makers must decide where the quota will go.  All we can do, as elected representatives, is to give our absolute commitment to ensure that most of what is put before us is implemented.  We must pressurise the people who make decisions to implement the suggestions.<\/p><p>  I cannot understand how the bass industry can allow non-Irish boats fishing our waters while we cannot.  It does not make sense.  We have no quota.  The witnesses are correct about spurdog, which is thick in the water.  When jigging for mackerel in July and August, one gets a lot more spurdog than mackerel close to the rocks.  It is soul-destroying to see what is happening to our communities.  Irrespective of our political parties, committee members must be vocal in pursuit of the aims and objectives of what the witnesses are promoting so that the 4,500 people involved in the sector can put food on the table for their families, live in the communities in which they were born and continue in the industry.<\/p><p>  Culling seals as humanely as possible, which has always been done, is how we protect stocks.  Some cowboys do it and give the whole thing a bad name and it has the opposite effect.  We need a cull for salmon.  There are culls of badgers, deer and other species in order to keep a balance.  When we were allowed to fish salmon, there was nothing worse than seeing 15 or 20 salmon in the net and seeing the seal taking the salmon out of the net.  When it drops to the bottom, the seal is eating the salmon and the fisherman is going home with nothing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013062500007#G00200","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372168200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Corcora and Mr. Connolly for their presentations and circulating the document which is very comprehensive and covers many of the issues I had hoped the committee would address as part of its deliberations.  The committee was tasked with drawing up a report to consider what policy initiatives could be implemented to aid the inshore fishing sector to allow people to continue fishing.  Much of the focus has been on alternative industries - in tourism and aquaculture, for example.  It is useful to have seen a fishing-based document and heard a presentation that demonstrate how people who want to remain in the industry could be facilitated and assisted.  I hope the report, when produced, will include some of the policy initiatives recommended in the document and put them onto another plain that could result in their implementation.<\/p><p>  It is good that there is an organisation for inshore fishermen and that their voice is represented.  It is very disappointing that Ministers have not been meeting the delegates and taking on board what they have been saying.  We should be able to make policy decisions that allow for inshore fishermen to remain in the industry and continue to work together.  That is for the common good.  Too often, people have regarded stocks as their own rather than those of the nation.  We should be able to devise policy in ways that will allow everybody to have a share of the stocks and maintain their livelihoods.  This is important.<\/p><p>  The submission contains some interesting ideas on fishing seasons, closed times, etc.  These ideas should be considered on a regional basis across the country.  They should inform policy-making and decision-making.  We should not devise a policy that excludes people; we should facilitate everybody as much as possible.  Of course, there will be horse-trading and some will be disappointed, but we should definitely not specifically exclude anybody.  The salmon fishing ban has highlighted this to a large extent.  Fishermen can now focus only on crabs and lobsters, which makes no sense.  I welcome some of the policies included in the document and hope they can be integrated into a report and included in the final report.  I hope we will be able to engage with the delegates in the future and encourage the relevant Ministers to do so also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013062500008#H00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1372168200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I welcome the two speakers.  As Deputy Martin Ferris stated, we come from fishing areas.  I was born and reared in Castletownbere and I am familiar with both sides of the delegates' argument in terms of the larger fleet that operates from Castletownbere.  There is also a huge inshore fleet, a forgotten fleet.<\/p><p>  Interestingly, the presentation goes to the core of what the committee was established to investigate.  The problems highlighted by Mr. O'Corcora are fundamental in determining how the committee should do its work and produce its report.  Other sectors such as aquaculture have representative bodies, NGOs and even Departments looking after their interests.  While they are not perfectly served, they are better served than the inshore fleet.  We should carry out an exercise in this regard.  Mr. O'Corcora, as with us all, will realise that the fleet capacity is set.  So many tonnes and kilowatts are allowed and that is the way it is.  If one had estimates of the numbers of jobs per tonne and kilowatt provided by the inshore and other fleets, they would tell a very interesting story.  One should bear in mind that coastal communities have been ravaged by emigration and the lack of opportunities that could be provided.  Perhaps the committee could carry out this exercise in its deliberations and put the matter under the spotlight.<\/p><p>  Fishing gets very bad press nationally and internationally.  The one exception is the inshore fleet.  Celebrity chefs and all those who seem to have an inordinate say in the media point to the inshore fleet because the fishery is sustainable and provides a living for families and support for communities - no more and no less.  The industry has much potential and this needs to be recognised.  If the committee did nothing other than recognise the potential of the inshore fleet, it would be a very good start.<\/p><p>  There is conflict, as we know.  Everything is not rosy in the garden because really delicate and sensitive management are required, even within the inshore fleet, to produce a policy or consensus.  Added to this are the competing interests of the larger vessels from the polyvalent, pelagic, beam and aquaculture sectors.  In addition, there is bureaucracy in the Department and Government policy.  Although I question why one would start at all, a start is needed.  Today's testimony is a good start.<\/p><p>  The driftnet ban in respect of salmon fishing was referred to.  Mr. Michael Keatinge of BIM testified that this could be examined.  He said that, using scientific information from the Marine Institute, for example, we could revisit these issues.  He excluded Aran M&oacute;r, for whatever reason, because the salmon run there is different.  I would welcome a re-examination.<\/p><p>  There is an inevitability about the policy on days at sea.  I was at a meeting yesterday morning in Castletownbere and noted that, irrespective of how the discard ban will be operated and administered, the days at sea concept was becoming part of the conversation.  I believed I would never hear about it.  It is coming from the industry.  One must talk about proposals.  The idea will be unpopular in some quarters and might be supported in others, but, at least, if one discusses concepts such as ring-fencing fisheries and additions to licences, there is merit in it.<\/p><p>  I heard an interesting proposal on banning pelagic fishing entirely from March to May or June for all fleets.  This effort would give more challenged species a chance, particularly when breeding.<\/p><p>  I am very interested in the proposals on substituting the V-notching, seeding for scallops and whatever else can be done.  The schemes are very progressive.  There was a scheme for scallops and reasonable success.  Schemes should be re-examined.  If they provide for a 20% increase in effort, it would be very much welcomed.<\/p><p>  The seal debate will be very contentious.  As Deputy Martin Ferris stated, people really do not understand the issues involved.  Tourists might like to see seals on the rocks, but a seal that goes to a driftnet will take one bite out of every fish.  It will take a bite out of the belly of the first fish, move onto the next one and take a bite out of its belly and continue in that vein, thus decimating stocks.  If that is the natural approach, it is difficult to deal with, but seals need to be managed in some shape or form.  It is about striking a balance between what is environmentally sound and what is economically sustainable for communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013062500008#H00300","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372168800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh &aacute;r gcuairteoir&iacute;.

A total of 75% of the boats are less than 10 metres but, like everything else, if their catches were compared to those of the large boats, the breakdown would be 90:10 or worse and that is the nub of the issue.  If we are to pursue this path together, we must first arrive at a cross-party consensus.  We will then pursue a line that many people will say is attractive but will never succeed.  A short effort will be put in and then it will be dropped.  A fundamental change in how we do business is needed.<\/p><p>  When I was first approached by this organisation, I was interested in a number of basic concepts.  The first is the concept of <i>de minimis<\/i>. In other words, we are forever micro managing the small operators but, in many cases, the larger operators are governed by the same rules.  I recall during the drift net debate going out fishing one evening with guys in a currach to pull in the nets, which was legal at the time.  It was man against nature in a big way.  The reality is that over 100 years they had not managed to out-fish the capability of fish.  Mechanisation and automation have made many things unsustainable and, therefore, coastal communities must fish in an area exclusive to inshore fishermen in which all the stock can be fished in the knowledge that one will never be allowed to have a boat bigger than 10 metres.  The boat will be always limited in hauling in nets over a certain size.  In that way, fishing by definition would be sustainable.<\/p><p>  If we try to say we want a special deal for Ireland on inshore fishing, we are doomed to failure.  On the other hand, if we said coastal communities with small boats should have first call on stocks adjacent to their shores and the same should apply in Spain, Portugal, Great Britain and other maritime countries and we worked at gathering support for that, we might succeed because we would then create a pan-European demand among such communities for a fair share of the stocks within a set radius of the shore.  Limiting the number of stocks that can be fished, as Mr. &Oacute;'Corcora said, would put impossible pressure on the remaining stocks and, therefore, the limits should be applied to the size of boats and nets and all stocks should be fished.  If the change is to be made at European level, it will take five to ten years.  When I say that to people, they realise if they had started ten years previously, they would be home and dry with this change to the Common Fisheries Policy.  If the representatives wait another five years to come in and have a bitch at us about what is not happening and we all give out to each other about what is not happening and we say if it does not happen tomorrow, it will not happen, we will be exactly where we are now.  We all have to decide whether we have a common position and, if so, whether we are willing to take whatever time it takes to achieve long-term results regarding the European input into this issue.   This is a major European issue in the context of quotas, TACs and so on.<\/p><p>  I refer to salmon fishing.  Without Inland Fisheries Ireland declaring that there is surplus fish, the organisation is dead in the water but, luckily, its staff have said there is a surplus in certain areas, although there is a particular difficulty in County Donegal because there is mixed stock fishing.  When I was in Cabinet we fought powerful forces on this issue, which we must recognise.  The Minister at the time, Mary Coughlan, fought them.  I used to always argue that none of the drift net fishermen wanted an unsustainable fishery.  If they did, they were fools because they were cutting off their noses to spite their faces.  However, we must recognise that to make progress, we must make alliances with those engaged in the science of this issue and work with them to come up with solutions over which they can stand in order that, internationally, we can prove we are not in any way damaging stocks.  Anything else would be foolish and would not lead anywhere productive.  Just saying &quot;we want&quot; will not achieve anything.  If we tried to return to where we were, I estimate 85% of Deputies across all parties would oppose it.  I recall having that argument with fishermen.  I would love to see a free vote on this issue because I guarantee if we tried to return to the old <i>status quo<\/i>, it would be roundly beaten in the House.  We should recognise the challenge we face.  Fishermen living on the coast should have access to surplus stock as long it is sustainable.  It must be done in a way that is saleable nationally and internationally.  That is a major task but one on which we should work.  IFI, which has responsibility for salmon rights, has a key role to play and we need to work with its staff.<\/p><p>  I agree with Mr. &Oacute;'Corcora on the seals.  At the end of the day, there is no point making poor old <i>homo sapiens<\/i> starve while there is an overabundance of a predator that has done more than fishermen ever did to decimate stocks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013062500009#J00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372169400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le baill an choiste uilig.

I think the delegation got a flavour from the members of the importance they attach to the presentation.  The conclusion of the presentation sets out the bottom line from the committee's point of view.  If the sub-committee accepts on a cross-party basis that vessels under 10 m are vital for the survival and sustainability of rural, coastal and island communities, we have to consider putting forward an agreed position along the lines of the suggestion made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  Perhaps we could recommend that those using such vessels be allowed to fish inside certain limits and to a certain capacity, with a mixed fish stock, at a level that allows for continued and ongoing sustainability and the maintenance of the species balance and everything else.  Perhaps some of the other things we have discussed can work in harmony with that basic principle.<\/p><p>  When I was a member of this committee in the last D&aacute;il, we travelled to meet the previous Commissioner, Joe Borg, who was from Malta.  He made the point that when the current Common Fisheries Policy was drawn up, his aspiration was that a two-track approach would be adopted, with one track for the larger fleet and the other track for smaller island and coastal communities in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.  Rightly or wrongly, he was not appointed to this portfolio for a second term.  I think discards have become the biggest issue in the portfolio of measures that the current Commissioner wants to see implemented.  It is not that the previous priority has been excluded.  Maybe this committee should reboot that effort.  While we can play our part, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v rightly pointed out that work is needed at EU level.  We are just about to embark on a Common Fisheries Policy that does not do anything that is exclusively negative in this regard, but does not do anything to help either.  We need to try to refocus attention on the coastline from Malin to Kinsale, in particular.  That part of the country is most affected by this.<\/p><p>  I thank the members and the witnesses for their comments.  We extended the period of time of the hearings to receive today's presentation.  It was definitely worthwhile from the perspective of all committee members.  I think I am the only member present who does not come from a coastal fishing community.  When I listened to what was said about seals, I was reminded that the same issues are arising with deer where I come from.  The difficulty in such cases lies with the public perception of what people are trying to do, as opposed to what they are actually trying to do.  I did not think a comparison could be made between deer and seals, but it is relevant in this case.  That concludes today's proceedings.  I thank members and witnesses again for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013062500011#L00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","time":1372163400,"counter":25},{"type":"unspoken","content":"The Joint Committee met at 13:30","time":1372163400,"counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500002"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Ten Point Plan for Micro, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: Discussion","time":1372163400,"counter":29,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500003#B00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1372163400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>The first session is a discussion with Chambers Ireland on its alternative ten point plan.

With over 50 member chambers, we represent the needs of the business community in every geographical region and economic sector in Ireland.  Therefore, we are in a unique position to understand the concerns of the business community and express its views at national level.<\/p><p>  One of our core policy priority areas is the support of small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs.  Given that over 90% of all businesses in Ireland are SMEs and that most employment is located in this sector, meaningful and sustainable job creation depends on a strong and vibrant SME sector.  The inclusion of a ten point plan for micro enterprises in budget 2013 was welcomed by both Chambers Ireland and the chamber network around the country.  However, our analysis of the proposals led us to the conclusion that they would have limited impact on the trading conditions of most businesses.  Specifically, we believe too many of the measures included unnecessary limitations, were limited to certain sectors, were merely extensions of existing schemes or were merely facilitators of change rather than actual stimulus measures.  Transformative outcomes will only be possible through more ambitious and far-reaching measures.<\/p><p>  In response, we brought together a range of representatives from around the network and subject matter specialists from major accounting and taxation firms to produce an alternative ten point plan.  Throughout these deliberations we were guided by certain key principles: that the proposals must be ambitious; they must be designed to achieve job creation and retention; as far as possible restrictions on business and trade ought to be removed; our focus was to remain on indigenous, non-exporting companies which currently receive little support from State agencies; and all proposals must be revenue neutral as far as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372164300,"counter":34,"content":"<p>We will take questions in groups and we will start with Deputies Dara Calleary and Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Senator Quinn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500005#D00200","speaker":"1023"},{"type":"speech","time":1372164300,"counter":35,"content":"<p>If three speakers are taken together and they comment on all ten points the witnesses may have to deal with 30 comments.

Has Chambers Ireland calculated the cost benefit of its proposed reduced VAT rate for housing repair?  A five year period has been proposed for offsetting corporation tax against other taxes for start-ups.  This is a long time for start-ups, in that after the third year sustainability issues come into question.  How would this work in practice?  Would all losses over the five years be used to write off all forms of PRSI, VAT and corporation tax?  I understand the idea that a reduction in capital gains tax would allow for investment in the business, which would be better for the business.  Would it not be more efficient to provide a tax break against capital gains taxes on money invested into the business?  This would mean it would not be a case of profit-taking and there would be close alignment of investment in the business with reductions in capital gains.<\/p><p>  We have been speaking with Chambers Ireland about rates in town centres and we believe there is a necessity for a progressive rates base which reflects the profitability of particular businesses.  The problem with double rent reductions is that the Government would be subsidising landlords directly.  What is the view of Chambers Ireland on the possibility of the introduction of legislation or constitutional reform with regard to upward only rents?  It is a significant issue.  It does not affect a broad section of businesses in relative terms but it is very significant for the businesses which are affected.  Would constitutional reform be useful?<\/p><p>  I could not agree more on the \"Ireland rate of return\" element.  There needs to be a value for money basis on how the wider local economy is affected.  In the North it was very significant that tenders were broken up into small bite sized chunks so small and local businesses could start to consume them.<\/p><p>  With regard to a tax incentive policy and private sector investment, the issues of demand for credit and bank lending are core and should come before tax credit.  I have no problem with nearshoring.  The 2.5% for research and development is a good idea.  Incentives with regard to research and development often do not reach small businesses and this needs to happen.  Smaller businesses sometimes have problems with matched funding.  Does Chambers Ireland have proposals on how smaller businesses could better access matched funding?

The advice we got from accounting an tax professionals in the group is that a three-year period, given where we are in the economic cycle, is not long enough to prove whether a business will succeed or fail.  That is why we propose a five-year period, with a cap to limit any Exchequer exposure.<\/p><p>  We are formulating proposals to get entrepreneurs thinking about establishing and growing businesses, as currently they are not doing so.  People are still afraid to invest in the future and we are trying to think of ideas that will encourage, stimulate and give people a sense that the Government is behind them, although perhaps in a number of small ways rather than one big way.  A number of incentives could contribute a couple of thousand euro to help businesses keep the doors open.<\/p><p>  With regard to research and development, the manner in which we produced the proposal was to recognise that there are State resources with significant pools of money for investment.  We want to have the State companies responsible for taking 2.5% of their budget and ensuring this is pushed out to small businesses.  There is not much take-up now but we want to try to get 2.5% accountable to a sponsoring Department getting into small businesses and making innovation projects work.  We did not really get into the challenges of raising matched funding and so on and we wanted a combination of carrot and stick.  That would allow people with budgets to be empowered and encouraged to get out there, find ideas in small businesses and deliver to them.

The French model allows for a more targeted approach to diversity and shop mix.<\/p><p>  We have been a supporter of local property taxation and we welcome its introduction, although the timing is poor in terms of the economic cycle.  It has always been needed to disincentivise local authorities in chasing development levies etc.  When the local property tax is being rolled out, we have a once in a generation opportunity to support and recalibrate funding and taxing of local government in a way that supports jobs, often with low-skilled staff or businesses with a low margin.

Nevertheless, it can work, and a shopkeeper knows that if he brings down a price cleverly, he can take in more money.

There is an opportunity to be able to reduce the VAT rate on housing repairs, and there will be benefits from 23% VAT coming from other items.<\/p><p>  There are not enough similar ideas in the document.

We must ensure the advantage of any scheme is confined to builders who are tax registered and tax compliant.<\/p><p>  I do not understand the proposal to allow corporation tax to be offset against other taxes.  I should understand it because I studied tax for long enough.  As I understand it, start-up companies are currently exempt from corporation tax up to approximately &euro;1 million.  I am not sure how this tax can be offset against VAT and PAYE.  Small and medium-sized enterprises are supposed to collect VAT, hand it over to the State and offset it against their own tax.  I also have concerns about how the payroll aspect of this proposal would work manually because it would affect people's PRSI claims.  I think the capital gains tax proposal is a great idea.  We need that.  The more movement we have on that, the more innovation we have.<\/p><p>  My biggest issue relates to the whole area of soft supports.  I do not see anything in this regard.  From what I am hearing on the ground, SMEs are constantly calling for supports of this nature to help them to access information and new markets when they are trying to develop their businesses.  We could do a much better job in that regard.  I am sure the delegation welcomed this morning's announcement by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, that &euro;21 million is to be committed for research and development under the competitiveness fund.  I do not think we are doing half of what we need to be doing in research and development.  We need to increase threefold, at least, our current level of investment in this area.  According to the EU, we need to increase our current investment, which is approximately 1.15% of GDP, to approximately 3% of GDP by 2020.  That is very interesting.  When the US had its biggest economic crisis in the 1930s, it poured money into innovation and research.  We could learn some valuable lessons from what the US did to pull itself out of the depression.  It is obvious that Europe is still very sluggish.  We are particularly concerned about France.  If there is no lift in an area that comprises 40% of the global economy, we will have a problem in Ireland.  Innovation is still a big issue.<\/p><p>  The seed capital and investment incentive schemes have never worked.  They are fantastic, but there is a big blockage in this regard.  We need to make them simpler.  I wonder whether Chambers Ireland could look into that.  I know the Irish Taxation Institute will be in.  There seems to be a blockage with regard to these schemes.  They need to be open to everybody.  They need to be made far simpler.  Under the seed capital scheme, one has to spend the money before one can get it back.  Perhaps there is another way of organising it.  I ask the delegation to consider this aspect of the matter and come up with some ideas on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500007#F00200","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1372165500,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Murphy and Mr. Talbot.

Can they elaborate on the French model to which they referred?<\/p><p>  The fourth proposal in the ten point plan involves the adoption of a targeted approach to rates reduction for businesses in town centres.  This committee has received presentations from retailers and has visited a number of towns.  The retailers have expressed similar concerns and made similar proposals.  I know where they are coming from when they speak about the effects of big multiples.  It may be the case that smaller outlets associated with a large multiple are struggling or dealing with their own issues.  It might be counter-productive to impose higher rates on them to benefit other smaller shops.<\/p><p>  Are the businesses represented by Chambers Ireland placing an emphasis on the regeneration of town centres to encourage people to live in them?  Have the members of Chambers Ireland spoken about any initiatives aimed at developing living spaces above shops, etc.?  I would support a review of rates with an emphasis on large multinational industries that could easily pay higher rates, as opposed to out-of-town centres, if that would lead to a reduction in the rates paid by smaller businesses.  The current rates model needs to be scrapped.  I hope the valuation Bill will deal with that when it comes before us.<\/p><p>  A number of the issues I had intended to raise have already been raised.  I would welcome the delegation's first proposal aimed at kick-starting a whole area within the construction sector.  It is labour-intensive and it has huge potential.  It has been pretty much stalled for a period.  Obviously, the proposal would have a knock-on effect with regard to job potential.  I am interested in the costs in that regard.  Chambers Ireland has pointed out a 5% VAT rate in this sector would be 5% better than the current position, where no VAT is being paid because there is no activity.  I suppose the Department of Finance might look at it in a different way in terms of the potential VAT loss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500007#F00300","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372165500,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the committee for asking such great questions and for taking so much interest in the document.

We did not want it to be stripped away to the point where little of it remained.<\/p><p>  In the pre-budget submission we made last year, we recommended that the threshold pertaining to the payment of VAT on a cashflow basis, rather than on an accruals basis, be increased from &euro;1 million to &euro;2 million.  The Minister and the Department ultimately decided in the budget to increase it from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.25 million.  The increase of &euro;250,000 was not enough to make a difference.

That is where we have to examine things like how many households have formed during the last six years of recession, when we have not been doing any building.

Half of the &euro;330 million figure should be specifically earmarked for owner-managers and their management teams to help them upskill.

As we stated last year, more needs to be done to raise the profile of the seed capital scheme because people are not familiar with it.  Certainty about the scheme is poor, as is drawdown.  I recall a Deputy commenting last year that only one client in a particular operation had ever drawn down funds from the scheme.  There is considerable pent-up demand in this area which could be tapped.  <\/p><p>  It is sobering to note that whereas &euro;152 million was drawn down from the employment incentive and investment scheme in 2007, only &euro;20 million was drawn down from the scheme last year.  Demand has clearly collapsed.  The Government must take action to address this issue.  Measures it should consider include: the introduction of a seed employment investment incentive scheme; the removal of the high income earner restriction; the reinstatement of the minimum holding period for five years; and automatic qualification for medium-sized companies in non-assisted areas.  We have a number of other suggestions but our main point is that action is needed.  It is clear that something is wrong when the funding drawn down from a scheme declines from &euro;152 million to &euro;20 million.  This ties in with our critique that demand is a major issue.  If demand increased, debts would become much more manageable for everyone.

Then when one earns one's money and pays one's tax, the amount in question would be offset.  It is really a cashflow mechanism - with a cap in place - to assist companies negotiate their early years in operation.  I accept that there are incentives in the first couple of years in respect of corporation tax, etc.  Some of this comes down to psychology rather than the amount of money involved.  We talk to many potential and existing entrepreneurs - people who have established businesses and who are considering setting up others - who are currently of the view that all that is happening at present is that rates are either being increased or maintained.  They are certainly not being reduced to the same extent as other costs.  In addition, they are of the view that new taxes on employment are forcing them to examine the position with regard to their employees' salaries.  Setting up a business is extremely hard work, particularly as the global economy is in such a mess.  The mechanism to which I refer is designed to give people something of a psychological boost to the effect that the State is behind entrepreneurs and is offering them a few incentives.<\/p><p>  In our critique of the ten-point plan in last year's budget we indicated that too many of the measures did not have much general applicability.

We tried, therefore, to come up with a few more targeted initiatives which could be applied more generally to people establishing businesses.

I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the budget with the committee in June, which is probably a first.  Following the presentation, which I will keep short, we are happy to take questions and debate.  We will make a formal pre-budget submission in the normal way this week.  We have not made a formal submission yet, but have a fair degree of clarity on the emerging issues and priorities for business in advance of budget 2014.  To provide some context, it will be useful for me to set out what IBEC is picking up from the business community and our 7,500 members on the performance of the economy over the first half of the year and the issues arising as a result.<\/p><p>  A useful approach is to discuss our domestic and export economies.  In the domestic economy, the jobs market, earnings growth, low inflation and falling interest rates look better than we thought they would halfway through 2013.  These are the fundamentals facing Irish consumers but improvements in them have not translated into spending.  The confidence genie remains absent from the Irish economy.  People's finances are perhaps in reasonable condition, but they do not have the confidence to spend meaningfully.  While clarity will be provided in the Central Statistics Office national accounts on Thursday, it appears that in the first quarter - and probably in the first half of the year - the consumer market was weak.  Despite things being a little better for consumers, they are not going out to spend.  The domestic side of the economy is quite disappointing.  On the export side, it is a really a tale of two different economies.  Our goods sector is finding trading conditions difficult.  Goods exports are down approximately 10% in the first quarter as our trading partners in the UK and the main European markets remain in a difficult place.  Our services sector continues to perform very strongly.  Exports will do fine this year, but it will all be on the back of services.<\/p><p>  We have made great inroads over the last couple of years on general competitiveness in the economy but still have a great deal to do.  A number of cost pressures and concerns for business are emerging.  Electricity costs, for example, are becoming a major issue.  On the employment costs front, voluntary health insurance is feeding in as a major cost for employers.  Approximately 70% of our members pay some or all of the voluntary health insurance contributions of their employees.  While it is a big cost for households, it is also a big cost for business.  It is a particular concern at the moment.<\/p><p>  IBEC is very conscious of the need to avoid coming to the committee with a shopping list of 101 things business would like to see in budget 2014.  We have clear priorities on the important issues and have five key messages on what government should do.  The first recommendation is on the scale of fiscal adjustment.  This feeds back very much to the weakness in the domestic economy.  While fundamentals have improved, spending has not come through.  The Government's plan to is to take a further &euro;3.1 billion out of the economy to put us on the path towards budget balance.  In our view, a great deal has changed in the last year.  Importantly, we have seen concessions in the promissory notes restructuring.  We are ahead of where we thought we would be on our budget deficit targets.  For the first time since the start of the crisis, the Government has a choice.  Until now, we have said the Government had no choice but to live with planned austerity.<\/p><p>  The Government should choose to implement somewhat less austerity.  We suggest an adjustment of &euro;2.6 billion instead of &euro;3.1 billion and there should be no further additional tax increases.  We accept that &euro;500 million in tax increases are already in the pipeline, but there is no need to announce additional taxation measures in budget 2014.  If we deliver an adjustment of &euro;2.6 billion, we will still reach comfortably the budget deficit target.  The very clear message it would give to Irish households is that the worst of the austerity is behind us, evidenced by a tangible impact of the restructuring of the promissory notes and the strong performance on budget deficit targets.  It would not affect us in the bond markets and we would bring growth back to the economy.  The upside would not be new taxes through higher tax rates, it would be higher tax revenue through buoyancy.  We must focus on growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500011#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372168200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>The presentation was succinct.

What would Mr. O'Brien say to the argument that some would put forward that if we go the way IBEC suggests, it will send out a wrong message that we are easing off too early and there is a danger that in doing so because we will begin to lose the confidence of the markets?  On the specific proposal of the suggested adjustment of &euro;2.6 billion instead of &euro;3.1 billion, what forecasted rate of growth for the economy underpins the IBEC proposal?<\/p><p>  On employment costs, I am completely with IBEC.  My party tabled a Private Members' motion on sick pay last year.  Would Mr. O'Brien reiterate the figures on the health costs, particularly the percentage of IBEC members who pay health costs for their employees?  How does that rate, in terms of competitor countries, for what Mr. O'Brien called mobile investment?  Is that a particularly Irish phenomenon or do all Ireland's competitor countries in this mobile investment area pay health cover as well?<\/p><p>  On business financing, would Mr. O'Brien update the committee on where IBEC's members are in relation to finance generally and bank credit?  Why, in its members' view, is there a relatively low uptake of the two schemes?  We are trying to get our heads around that in particular.  I welcome IBEC's proposal for an entrepreneur capital gains relief.

If people believe that tomorrow will be worse than today, there will be no spending.  If people believe that tomorrow will be a better day, that expectations element is really important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500012#L00500","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372168800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>On the right amount of austerity and what the markets think, over the first five months of the year we were in a sweet spot with bond yields but they moved against us a little bit due to various external factors.  While the markets are examining how the public finances are being fixed, they are also looking at growth in the economy.  We could keep delivering on market expectations on austerity.  However, if we disappoint on growth rates, one could give up what one gained for good fiscal housekeeping.  We think consumer spending is pent up and it will be unleashed when confidence comes back.  While 85% of the fiscal adjustment is behind us and budgets will get easier at some stage, consumers do not believe that.  The time horizon is so distant for them, it is not influencing their decisions on consumption.  There has to be a tangible benefit and dividend for householders that we have done the hard yards, restructured promissory notes and outperformed in reducing the budget deficit.<\/p><p>  Will the bond markets penalise us for lessening austerity?  I do not think so excessively.  I believe it would be a strategy worth pursuing in what it would give us in growth and jobs.  Our current growth forecast for next year is 2.5%.

The State would get back the revenue on the buoyancy side.<\/p><p>  Our surveys show that 70% of our members are paying some or all of the health insurance costs of their employees.  It has become a significant labour cost item and has registered with the multinational sector.  It is a concern.<\/p><p>  There is some unmet demand in access and availability of credit.  Our real concern is where the investment finance will come from when we return to growth.  Have we a sufficiently robust and healthy banking system that can provide that investment finance?  As we have told the committee in the past, Ireland was excessively reliant on banking finance in the past.  This will have to change and we are going to need a much more diverse funding model.  We would see schemes from Enterprise Ireland, such as the employment investment incentive scheme, and other funding mechanisms such as the National Pensions Reserve Fund playing a role in diversifying availability of credit.  The employment investment incentive scheme is not really delivering and it can be adjusted to make it work.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n on consumer expectations.  People feel more taxes will be introduced and we are still waiting for consumer confidence to come back.  The savings ratio is still incredibly high and there is no sign of it coming down.  If there were a greater certainty for households, spending would come back because the capacity to spend is evident in the savings ratio.<\/p><p>  We have detailed analysis of the jobs benefit of the measures introduced to help the hospitality sector.  We are making a submission on this to the Government tomorrow which we will also send to the committee.  Our analysis shows these measures really worked, brought in jobs, revenue for the Government and are worth keeping.  Given the wider fragility in the domestic economy, it is far too early to remove these emergency measures.<\/p><p>  Electricity costs to business have come to the top of the agenda again.  In particular, large energy users tend to be in internationally competitive sectors.  For some businesses it can be a really large cost item.<\/p> <p>Very often, it can be non-pay labour costs, for example pensions.  We see many employers who are still trying to work through issues such as defined-benefit pension schemes, which carry incredible costs.  Health insurance costs are also an issue.  While we do not have useful international comparators, we know that in countries where business pays somewhat higher social insurance costs, that buys a great deal for employees in pension and health benefits.  Employers do not have to pick up that tab.  In Ireland, much of the cost is on a certain cohort of employers - the larger ones which are competing internationally.  They are more likely to have pension schemes and health insurance.  They carry a great deal of additional cost in terms of their fully loaded labour costs.  In Germany, social insurance contributions pay for pensions and the bulk of health care.  In Ireland, they do not and much of the cost is left with the employer.<\/p><p> We have done a great deal of detailed work on the research and development tax credit, feeding into the Department of Finance review.  I will send the details of the work to the committee.  I fully agree on the significant challenge on take-up among SMEs.  We have suggested to the Department of Finance that there would be considerable merit in having what may be termed a &quot;research and development light&quot; scheme for SMEs.  It is complex, involving a great deal of heavy tax analysis and issues of defining research and development activity.  It would be useful to have a simpler, <i>pro-forma<\/i>scheme for SMEs, published by Revenue and promoted by Enterprise Ireland.  Many SMEs are carrying out research and development but do not realise it.  They are not getting support and a dedicated scheme could make a real difference.  I am happy to send our specific suggestions in that regard to the committee and to engage on them afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500013#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372169400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.  It is always nice to have IBEC in.  We are here in good time.  We have discussed the budget a great deal already.  The Small Firms Association attended in that regard.  The witnesses will be glad to know regarding their first suggestion that the Minister for Finance will report back to us in September to let us know the figures and what he will do with regard to the budget and austerity measures.<\/p><p>  I agree that VAT reductions for the tourism and hospitality sectors have worked very well.  We would all like to see the measure continued and carried over to other sectors, particularly the building trade.  Employment costs are important, particularly from the point of view of small businesses who take on staff.  We have all realised finally that it is the small businesses that will be the backbone of the country and create the jobs.  I mentioned the research and development tax credit earlier.  It must be extended.  By 2020, we must be investing three times more in research and innovation than we are investing now.  We must start the process.  I agree with the idea of a light scheme for small companies, many of which are conducting research but not getting support.  This goes back to my earlier comment on business supports, of which we do not have enough.  It is time to do more for small businesses and to make supports more accessible.  Now is the time to do so with the introduction of LEOs and the realignment of Leader programmes.  We need far better supports, improved accessibility and improved qualifications among those providing supports.<\/p><p>  Tax investment is interesting.  I speak about it a great deal.  The employment incentive scheme and the seed capital scheme have not been taken up.  A business has to spend the money before it can recover it through the seed capital scheme.  I wonder if there is an alternative.  A business must invest the money in its capital.  Could not a person who sets up a business just claim it back even if he or she did not invest it in the company?  There should be an easier way to make that happen.  When we changed the old BEF scheme to the employment incentive scheme, it no longer seemed to have the same bite.  How can we improve access to it?  My view is that anyone who invests in a new business should get tax relief.  That is all probably angel investment, which we should have if we are serious about entrepreneurship and growing the economy.  Is it something we could look at in terms of the employment incentive scheme?  I would be delighted if Mr. O'Brien and Ms Fitzpatrick could send me any information they have in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500014#N00200","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1372169400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from IBEC.

Is there a concern about a possible impact on the validity of the budget figures?  It has been noted repeatedly that people have significant savings and that there are issues of confidence.

Given what households have gone through over the past number of years, I am not sure it is right to tax people more so that we can pick investment projects.

At present, the Dublin economy is doing okay.  Outside of Dublin is not so good.  It is a case of whether we could get something that would really get around the country and get at the unemployment problem, particularly among the former construction workers.  Home improvement has the potential to do that.  We have seen half a dozen schemes that have worked really well and we have a sense of frustration that we have not been able to gain traction on this domestically.  We would be happy to engage with the Deputy on the detail of that.  We have a good deal of detail and analysis on that in a separate paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500015#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372170000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>If I may comment on the investment piece, in terms of avoiding a repeat of the 1980s, where there was a pull-back on capital investment which left bottlenecks that were not unwound until I arrived in Ireland in 2000, and the results of which catch-up I have seen, we need to think of it strategically and to look at what bottlenecks might emerge.

It also is taking a little time to gain traction.  Previously, we probably had too many employment support schemes.  Ms Fitzpatrick would be aware of the work we did on awareness and the awareness of the available schemes was poor.  The tidying up into that single jobs plus scheme will help.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Kyne on the points about the timing of the budget, obviously, there are issues around so much of that tax coming in in the key month of November.  I suppose our main reflection is on the potential for giving certainty in the domestic economy.  Having the budget two weeks before Christmas always killed the retail sector over the past couple of years.  We would see significant benefit in bringing the budget back to October and trying to provide certainty.  If, in particular, there was a budget with less or no tax increases, we could have a great Christmas out of it.  Moving it out of the Christmas shopping period is a real positive.<\/p><p>  We must wait and see whether we will have to go back to look at the timing of some of the tax payments.  Overall, what we would like to see long term is that budget day becomes less of a big issue, that we do not see as many surprises, that we operate more on genuine multi-year budgeting activity and that consumers are not getting surprises or shocks when it comes to budget day.  In the short term, there probably still are some risks.<\/p><p>  The sick certificates issue has come up with many employers, particularly with all the debate about sick pay over the past couple of years.  It seems particularly easy in Ireland to get sick certificates.  It is commented on by those who have international experience.  We also see it showing up in terms of the numbers of recipients on illness benefit.  When one compares those numbers internationally, they are high.  That is part of the challenge.<\/p><p>  In terms of the United Kingdom attractiveness for investment, I suppose I am unclear whether it will be an advantage or a disadvantage.  Business does not like uncertainty.  I could see why some deciding on big investment in the United Kingdom, particularly if it is a big infrastructure investment, such as energy, might ask over the coming years where the United Kingdom will be in terms of EU energy policy.  One could see such concerns.  However, it could give them more flexibility.  They have been very aggressive on mobile investment.  They are now a real competitor for us and we need to watch them.  On a regular basis, we see professional services companies from the United Kingdom over here pitching the attractiveness of companies moving to the United Kingdom.  These will not only be foreign companies.  We will see Irish companies potentially move their operations to the United Kingdom as there is a more attractive offering over there.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins for her comments.  On the seed capital scheme, if one asks, not only those out on the street but small business persons and entrepreneurs, what is the EIIS or the seed capital scheme, they just do not know.  It is a shame.  On the EIIS, we have a couple of specific proposals looking at what they have done in other countries within the state-aid rules.  The issue one runs up against here when the Government is providing tax relief to invest in business is always whether it is within state-aid rules.  We have looked in detail at those state-aid rules and we think there is more we could do on potential risk sharing.  One of the key challenges is that, traditionally, it was a small cohort who invested in BES and we need to widen the net.  We need to get the more typical household investor.  They will have a different risk profile and we need to change the scheme to reflect their risk profile.  There is significant untapped potential in terms of those who might invest in Irish business and jobs, if they were given the rightly packaged and promoted scheme.  I will not give up on it yet.  It is something we can turn around, but it needs to be changed, re-branded and better promoted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500015#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1372170000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>It is interesting that crowd-financing, where small people invest small amounts of money, is taking off.

One of the initiatives on which we are working in Cork is looking at putting philanthropic donations into a fund to try to fill the gap where people can encounter difficulty in getting funding for entrepreneurship.  Often, where they get a certain amount from the bank or a certain amount from Enterprise Ireland or whatever source from which they get a grant, there is a gap for which they need either bridging finance or matching funding of 50% or 25%.  It is the first time this has been done in Ireland and we are trying to create a philanthropic fund, work on the diaspora, etc.  This is huge in Israel.  I wonder whether IBEC has any thoughts on that or any comments to make on it.

I appreciate the discussion.  It was important that they came.  Last year they had a very significant influence regarding the area of additional voluntary contributions, AVCs, and that was an IBEC proposal.  It was two years old at that stage but they made a presentation to the committee and many members took it on and tried to get the message across, as I am sure the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform did as well.  The Jobs Plus scheme also came through from the witnesses and the Small Firms Association as regards trying to target those schemes.  It is worth our while to invite them to appear before the committee to discuss initiatives that we can try to take on and drive.<\/p><p>  The issue of trying to get all the information together for business people is something we have discussed a few times at the committee, including with the witnesses.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is working on that document and I understand the Taoiseach's office is trying to finish putting it together.  We believe it will be very presentable and will show all the different services across government to help people in business and in employment.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, will help.  If they are implemented correctly, they should be one-stop-shops to provide that type of service and advice.<\/p><p>  I believe we need to sell our schemes.  Until the day we have someone going into a business to sell the various initiatives, they will not work fully.  We have to believe in them.  Sometimes we might be afraid there will be too much take-up and we do not talk about them in case people go for them.  However, we need to believe in them and push them because they will create jobs.  There are many good initiatives available if we push them.  Working with the witnesses, it is to be hoped we can do more on that.<\/p><p>  I have two or three questions.  I welcome the witnesses' key messages and I hope they are all implemented in terms of domestic demand and keeping the cost of business down, even in the area of research and development.  Must we do more to help businesses in exporting?  Can we do more as regards information and networking?  I attended a good event recently when Consulting Ireland launched its cluster initiative in Enterprise Ireland.  It is a programme that will run for the next nine or ten months and it aims to help businesses win contracts abroad.  Every day, there are 200,000 contracts to be won and Ireland does not get its fair share of them.  It appears we are not chasing them.  I realise many of them are through consulting as well, but many of them are public sector contracts.  We are ideally situated for them and they could lead on to more business.  Do we need to do more to encourage that type of work and to encourage network building?  If the witnesses cannot respond to that today, perhaps they could respond to us later.  Last year's budget tried to help people exporting into new markets, but we probably need to do more.  We can never do enough, I suppose, so perhaps the witnesses would give us their thoughts on that.<\/p><p>  In the same area of business, export credit insurance still seems to be an issue.  The committee has been told it is not, but I believe it is.  Businesses are telling us they have problems and concerns trading abroad.  There are different initiatives in that regard aside from straightforward export credit insurance.  Irish companies do not use invoice discounting or factoring of debts.  There is a very low take-up of that service in this country as well.  Is there a reason for that?<\/p><p>  To follow up on that, the witnesses might be familiar with the single euro payments area, SEPA, and the area of business to business, B2B.  Irish banks are not keen on implementing that.  Next February there is a commitment to do it for the ordinary domestic customer but not business to business.  Is that something that should concern us?  Is there a reason for it?  I am concerned about it and certain businesses have raised it with me and told me it will leave them at a disadvantage.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?  If they cannot deal with it today, perhaps they would refer back to the committee at another time.  It is something the committee might have to take on as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013062500016#P00300","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372170600,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Suonper&auml; to comment on SEPA.

The road is in a sub-standard condition and it epitomises and reflects the situation more generally.  There should be a significant concentration on those roads because they are very important for the whole transport system.  They are important for the rural bus transport system.  It is vital to ensure the upkeep and continual improvement of our local and county road network.<\/p><p>  There is a form of discrimination.

We never have enough money for roads.  The general Exchequer situation means that we do not have the allocations we want.  We accept that and are trying to do the best we can with what we have.  Given the budget constraints and the impact of reduced maintenance spending, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I decided to channel all available resources to maintenance and rehabilitation work to protect the investment that has been made.  This means that funding for major construction or realignment of schemes for regional and local roads has been discontinued.  In recent weeks, we have found an extra &euro;50 million for regional and local roads, which was badly needed, and I welcome it.  We also put forward a pilot community involvement scheme.  I note Deputy Tom Fleming's comments go both ways on this in supporting it and suggesting people cannot take the burden.  However, it does not need to be a financial contribution and can be in other forms also.  We will see how that goes.  We are trying to get more with less with the budget we have.<\/p><p>  Deputy Dooley has said it is hard to justify the level of funding but we simply do not have the money.  In the national recovery plan published by the previous Government the total funding allocated to roads over the period was less than we are giving.  From that point of view we are putting in more than the previous Government thought was feasible, but it still is not enough.  We need to work as much as possible with local authorities and we are trying our best.<\/p><p>  We need to support the local authorities that are doing their best.  While they get substantial funding from central government, they also have their own means of funding.  Some local authorities contribute considerable funding towards their local roads and others do not.  I believe we should give more support to those that are making a greater contribution.  It is depressing that some local authorities have actually dropped their allocation substantially while depending on the Exchequer for more funding.  Given the extent of the road network which is considerably beyond the European norm, we are doing our best with the funds we have.  We are trying a few schemes and we are closing out a number of projects.

We must balance the pendulum and not disincentivise people from being rescued because they think there will be a financial cost.  We must ensure safety is the number one issue.
