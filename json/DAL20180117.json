I also wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle a happy new year.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the CSO survey of income and living conditions results for 2016 because they show improvements in living conditions and tackling poverty.  In 2016 incomes rose by 3.1%, mainly due to rising employment, while the deprivation rate fell for the second year running.  We have now lifted 7,000 more children out of what we call consistent poverty.  <\/p>  <p>  By 2016, each of the rates quoted in the question was down substantially from its peak in 2012-13.  I am very grateful for this.  The number of children living in consistent poverty was down from 12.8% to 11%; the number of children at risk of poverty was down from 20.3% to 19%, while the number of children experiencing deprivation was down from 37% to 25%.  While I welcome these figures, they are still not good enough and will not be good enough until they are down significantly.<\/p>  <p>  Excluding pensions, the social welfare system continued to perform strongly in 2016, with the at-risk-of-poverty rate being reduced from 33.6% before social transfers to 16.5% after social transfers.  This equates to a poverty reduction effect of 51%, ensuring Ireland remains one of the best performing countries in the European Union in reducing the incidence of poverty through the social transfers system.<\/p>  <p>  The entire impact of the recovery is not fully reflected in the most recent data which relate to incomes in the period from 2015 to 2016.  Macroeconomic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since.  The unemployment rate fell from 9.4% in mid-2015 to 6.1% towards the end of 2017.  The number in receipt of working age income and employment supports has also continued to fall.  In addition, budget 2018 introduced increases in a range of supports, including an increase of &euro;5 per week in the maximum weekly rate for people of working age and young jobseekers and pensioners, with proportionate increases for adult dependants and an increase of &euro;2 per week in the qualified child dependant allowance which had not been increased in the previous eight years.  We all have to agree that these increases are aimed at assisting those individuals and families most in need.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion is set out in the national action plan for social inclusion.  The plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing the level of consistent poverty.

Nevertheless, the figure for the number of children living in consistent poverty in 2014 was 12.7%, which figure was reduced to 11.5% in 2015 and 11.1% in 2016.  If one does the figures, they show that 97% of the children who were living in consistent poverty in 2015 were also living in consistent poverty in 2016.  In the same three-year period the at-risk-of-poverty rate fell from 20.3% to 19.5% and then to 19.3%.  They show that 99% of the children who were at risk of poverty in 2015 were still at risk of poverty in 2016.  Does the Minister agree that the substantial economic growth which we acknowledge has happened in recent years and the substantial reductions in the rate of unemployment are not yet being properly reflected in the statistics for children?

Thankfully, in 2018 there are 320,000 more people working than when the Deputy's party left government in 2011.  Ensuring someone has a job is the single greatest thing any economy or government can do to try to take adults and children out of poverty.  There are some specific measures in the action plan.  The latest CSO survey of income and living conditions shows that the number of children living in consistent poverty fell to 11.1% in 2016.  Given the continued economic recovery this and the last Government have seen, it is reasonable to expect that future figures to show further improvements.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure the economic recovery is experienced by every person and in every county.  A key driver in preventing children from experiencing poverty has been social transfers, as indicated in the reduced averages, as well as child dependant payments and child benefit.  EUROSTAT data show that we reduce the at-risk-of-poverty rate before social transfers from just over 40% to just under 19% after social transfers.  We know that social transfers work.  We also know that the Government can only aid economic recovery, but when we have resources and the fruits of economic recovery, we can make sure they are targeted at the most vulnerable through the Social Welfare Bill.

The current rate bands applying to the State contributory pension were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.  The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic environment, which we all acknowledge, at that time.  Although the economic crash in 2008 led to a reduction in other welfare payments, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained.  In order to respond to the pressures on the State finances, however, it was necessary to achieve some savings in pension arena.  In order to do this in a manner that both minimised the impact on the most vulnerable pensioners and was consistent with long-term pension policy it was decided to align pension payments for new pensioners after 2012 more closely with the number of social insurance contributions made by a person.  This was achieved by introducing new rate bands for the purpose of calculating average contributions, which is the current system.<\/p>  <p>  The rate bands introduced in 2012 more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between the years 2000 and 2012.  Although for some people these bands have reduced their pension compared to what they would have received under the old rules, the pension that is paid is still disproportionate to the level of contributions that have been made.  For example, a person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years of his or her working life still receives an 85% pension payment.  Although the basis of averaging pensions is still relatively generous I recognise - I have said this before - that some people, mainly but not exclusively women, who have broken contribution histories are receiving a pension that is significantly lower than they would otherwise have received; a pension that is less, in some cases, than is paid to people with a similar level of contributions paid over an unbroken period.  I therefore have committed to examine options that will address this issue.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in a cost increase of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million each following year.  Officials in my Department have completed a report on this matter, which I intend to bring to a Cabinet committee tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700004#B00800","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1516185600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I have listened to the Minister's response and heard her trying to explain the rationale around why these changes were put in place but there is simply no rationale.

At no stage, however, have I ever said that the introduction of the bands, or the averaging system that arose from those band changes to the calculations of pensions, was wrong.

I am asking the Minister the same question as the previous ones with a different emphasis on the issue of discrimination against women who made their homes prior to that date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700005#C01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1516186200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question and I want to be able to answer it properly.  She is specifically asking about the homemaker's credit and not about the anomaly.  If she does not mind, I am going to shoot to a supplementary response because it more freely answers the question she has asked me.  In practice, there are a number of factors that make it impossible to be precise.  That is not the correct reply - I beg the Deputy's pardon.<\/p>  <p>  When the contribution pension was introduced in 1961, a yearly average approach was used for calculating entitlements.  As reckonable social insurance had just been introduced eight years prior to that, no one would have had the 30 to 40 years of contributions necessary to be paid under a total contributions approach.  However, having a yearly average model would allow many people to qualify for a full pension and with the extension of PRSI over the year, notably to self-employment and farmers in 1988, a total contributions approach can be used from around 2020 without disadvantaging people in those sectors.  They will have a 30-year window to accumulate what their contributions are.  The main difficulty with the yearly average approach is that it is possible for people to start to pay social insurance at a much later stage in life and still qualify for pensions to the maximum rate, which is not very fair.  That is why the yearly averaging system is going to be changed, hopefully, to a total contributions model.<\/p>  <p>  The reason the change was introduced at that time - I cannot tell the Deputy whether the date was arbitrarily chosen and, obviously, I was not around at that time - was to acknowledge genuinely that women stay at home and we take choices to come out of the workforce and to rear our family.  That change was introduced at that time to acknowledge the huge service to the family, community and society.<\/p>  <p>  I am speaking off the top of my head, only because I have had experience of introducing measures since I became Minister and I have had to pick a start date.  I commit to the Deputy that I will find the answer to why that date was picked and whether we looked at different dates at the time.  If the Deputy can give me some space, I will come back to her later today with a specific answer.  I do not know whether that date was arbitrarily chosen or whether we picked it for a reason.  I will come back to her on that later today and I am sorry I do not have a better answer for her on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700005#C01300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1516186200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister will not think of this in the same way that I do but in so far as we have our gender in common, on a daily basis we are faced with a barrage of elements of discrimination in this society, the latest being the revisiting of the debacle that Joanne Hayes faced in 1984 because of the Kerry babies issue.  The question that jumps out is this: why it is recognised that women leave the workforce and rear children for those after 1994 but not for those before then.  As we speak and was mentioned by other Deputies, there are people across the road in Buswells Hotel having a press conference.  One of them is a woman from Kildare called Joan McLoughlin who left the workforce in the 1970s to rear her family.  She has been very active in Pensioners for Equality, who had the last protest outside the D&aacute;il.  She was reported in a local newspaper in Kildare, from where she comes, as having said it is not about her, she runs a B&amp;B and is not too badly off but she is down &euro;55 a week on her old age pension.  However, she said, others are worse off.  She said one lady she was speaking to said when she goes back home she has to count out the pieces of coal.  She said, imagine in 2018 having to count every piece of coal and that is the reality for some people: it is.  There are pensioners living in poverty and many of them are women because they did the job that was expected of them, which was to be mothers and to rear their family.  I know the Minister wants to fix it and that she will try to fix it and she has said she will have to find new money.

Therefore, the 1994 business will be defunct once we reach 1 January 2020.

This includes ensuring applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  Before a decision can be made on entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance, evidence must be provided of the care recipient&rsquo;s care requirements, the level of care the carer provides and the carer&rsquo;s means.  In general, applications under social welfare schemes with a number of complex qualifying conditions can take longer to process.  This is compounded if the documentary evidence provided at the initial application stage is incomplete or insufficient.  This is often the case in the case of carer&rsquo;s allowance applications.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of 2017 the average waiting time in processing new carer&rsquo;s allowance applications was 17 weeks, with 5,284 applications awaiting decision.  The number of carer's allowance applications in hand is also a consequence of the continued increased intake of claims, with the number of applications in 2017 being 26% higher than in 2015.  Therefore, the second reason is the huge increase in the number of applications received.  <\/p>  <p>  Staff have been reassigned within the carer&rsquo;s allowance area to work on claims processing and it is expected that this will improve processing times under the scheme in the coming weeks.  A redesigned application form will be published shortly.  The new form will allow carers to provide more information on the type and level of care they provide, with the aim of providing deciding officers with the information they need to expedite decisions on entitlement.  We are, therefore, also hoping the new redesigned application form will speed up the process. <\/p>  <p>  The Department experienced delays in the processing of domiciliary care allowance claims during 2017 owing to a number of factors.  First, there was a significant increase in the number of applications being received.  The year-on-year increase in recent years has consistently been in the 15% to 20% range.  Second, following a High Court ruling in 2016, there is a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical officer and deciding officer to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating it to the customer.  Corrective actions were taken by the Department, including the allocation of additional resources.  The time required to finalise domiciliary care allowance claims has returned to the departmental standard, with claims being processed within 12 weeks on average during December 2017.  At the end of December, there were 1,240 domiciliary care allowance claims awaiting processing, representing a claims intake of just over two months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700006#D01400","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1516186800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I recognise that there is some positivity in the Minister of State's answer.

Neither figure was mentioned by the Minister of State who gave average waiting times.  Persons in need of care cannot wait for decisions.  There is something wrong with a system that, by the Minister of State's own admission, has an in-built delay of 17 weeks.  We know on the ground that the delay is much longer.

The Government acknowledges the crucial role carers play in society.  It is important, therefore, that the Deputy know that we are fully committed to supporting carers in their role.  Reform and investment are under way.  The carer's allowance is paid to persons providing full-time care and attention for elderly people or people with disabilities whose income falls within certain limits.  It is also important to state there are 74,887 persons in receipt of the carer's allowance, with 44,000 qualified dependent children.  Expenditure in 2017 was &euro;694 million.  The figure for domiciliary care allowance payments which are made to 34,000 families is &euro;200 million.  A strong message is being sent that we are providing support for carers in society.

These supports include the JobPath service and programmes such as community employment, CE, and T&uacute;s.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes such as CE and T&uacute;s provide part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Instead, they are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person's opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.<\/p>  <p>  JobPath aims to place jobseekers into full-time sustainable employment by providing intensive individual support to help them to overcome barriers to employment.  People who have completed their year-long engagement with JobPath may apply, if eligible, to participate in a work programme such as CE or T&uacute;s.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment.  Given the significant drop in the live register, it does not necessarily follow that difficulties filling vacancies would not have arisen if any of our schemes did not exist.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the economic recovery, my Department undertook a review of all the work programmes in 2016.  While the primary focus was on CE, the review also looked at other employment programmes, such as T&uacute;s.  Arising from the review, the Government agreed to implement changes to the qualifying conditions for CE in order to broaden access to a wider range of people.  These new rules were implemented in July 2017.  They included the qualifying age being reduced to 21 years.  In addition, while, in general, all placements will now be for one year only, if a CE participant is undertaking training to achieve a major award, the participant's time can be extended by up to two years to allow him or her to complete the training which will enhance his or her overall employment prospects.  This allows for three years continuous participation on the CE schemes.  Those over the age of 55 years can also remain on CE for three years.  In addition, the reference year for CE participation was moved from 2000 to 2007 which ensures that more people can re-qualify for the programme.  Overall, these changes improve the way the schemes operate and will allow more people who are long-term unemployed to access them.  I will continue to keep this whole area under review so that these schemes provide real and valuable support to both individuals and communities.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work that those on CE schemes and their host organisations do in communities.  We all know the real value of the services they provide and are appreciative of it.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is mindful of the large number of work programme places involved in service delivery and other valuable services around the country.  In this regard, if any scheme is experiencing particular recruitment difficulties, it should contact its local Intreo centre for assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700007#E05300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1516187400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.  In outlining the role of the CE and T&uacute;s schemes, the Minister indicates that the Government does not see them as sustainable pathways for people on their own and that her primary focus in relation to their objective is entirely towards placing people back in employment.  While that is a key objective, we also have to recognise the tremendous role which these schemes, and those who work on them, carry out in communities, whether it be in community associations, Tidy Towns groups, cr&egrave;ches, soccer clubs or GAA clubs.  In many ways, those who contribute to their community through a participation in a CE or T&uacute;s scheme help make communities tick and help make sustainable communities.  It is important we recognise that.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important we recognise that it is appropriate that some, particularly those who are reaching the end of their working life but who are also reaching the limit in terms of their participation in T&uacute;s or CE schemes, be allowed to continue to contribute to the community and that the guillotine simply does not come down and leave them in a situation where they are blocked from further participation in a scheme and contributing to their community and also not in a position to get employment.

If one reads between the lines, I am telling the Deputy I agree with him.  If a CE placement gives a person pride in serving his or her community, I do not see the benefit, if he or she does not have a job to go to, of taking the person off that scheme and sending him or her home to be in his or her house for a year before he or she can qualify.  We are continually looking at the two schemes and if and when I can make changes to reflect what I think the Deputy feels, I will try to make those changes.  The difficulty we have is they were established purely as activation measures to move people into jobs.  In some cases, with older people, for example, those jobs just do not exist.  I think I agree with the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700008#F00100","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1516188000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I echo and endorse everything my colleague, Deputy McConalogue, said.  I have a very similar position.  The Minister's answer touched on this a number of times.  Are these schemes intended solely as job activation measures or are they recognised as having a social inclusion element, which is absolutely essential?  As Deputy McConalogue alluded to, many of these schemes facilitate individuals who may not be in a position to attract normal, gainful employment and who may not be able to contribute in a commercial environment but who can contribute effectively, productively and usefully to their communities.  There are two groups of people affected by the difficulty in sourcing people for community employment schemes, the difficulty getting onto T&uacute;s schemes and the impact that JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec are having on that.  We have two groups of people who are losing out.  We have the individuals themselves who in many cases are denied the opportunity for dignified and worthwhile activity and an occupation that gives them pride, a reason to get up in the mornings and all the other good things such as contributing to mental health.  We also have the host organisations, whether they are GAA clubs, parish councils, tidy towns groups, local history groups or heritage groups, which are invariably working in the community on a not-for-profit basis.  They are coming to us and saying they do not have the stream of assistance which was beneficial to both the individual and the host organisation.  It conflicts with the two new providers, Turas Nua and Seetec, which maybe have a more commercial focus.  There are measures that could be introduced to tackle that and let them work more closely together in a more collaborative fashion.  I hope the Minister will look at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700008#F00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1516188000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>The Deputy made up his 30 seconds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700008#F00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516188000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>We have our ways.  Everything the Deputy has said is true.  There are hundreds, if not thousands of participants, in CE and T&uacute;s schemes who are doing social inclusion activities and our communities desperately rely on them.  The problem is my Department was not established, and CE and T&uacute;s were not established, to provide social inclusion services.  It is an employment activation measure.  It is no different from JobPath, which is not commercial; it is an employment activation measure.  The sole purpose in statute for the organisations that are hosting CE and T&uacute;s schemes is to give employment experience and opportunities to people so they can move on to full-time sustainable jobs.  The dilemma we have is that tens of thousands of people who have participated in them will probably never - or will never want to - get a full-time sustainable job.  I do not know how to change that because if I change it, it will not be an employment activation scheme and will not fall under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I acknowledge there are thousands of people on CE schemes who respect and value the social inclusion services they provide but do not achieve employment activation.  We need to square that circle by acknowledging, respecting and rewarding what they are doing but not under the guise of employment activation because if we continue to call these schemes employment activation schemes, we have to continue to move people on which is causing upset to the host organisations, the community service organisations and groups and the people who are doing the work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700008#F00400","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1516188000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>One would think from listening to the Minister that there is some higher power above the Minister, Government and national Parliament forcing these schemes to operate the way they do and tying the Minister's hands.  The reality is it is within the power of the Minister, Government and Parliament to influence and mould these schemes and to shape them in a way that is appropriate.  I am very proud it was my party that established the CE schemes in the first place because of the tremendous role they have gone on to play and the people within them who contribute on a daily basis to the local communities.  We need to acknowledge how it has evolved and what is involved in it now and we need to ensure it can continue to fulfil that purpose.  That requires amending it as appropriate.  We should keep its job placement and empowerment potential while recognising it has another role to facilitate many people in the community who will not go on to other jobs and who contribute to their communities.  Many of those people are forced to leave the scheme and are then not able to contribute or get a job.  The Minister can change that and we are saying she should change it and look at it again.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister comment on the supervisors who were in full-time jobs managing these schemes over the years?

The first is a realignment.  She mentioned the difficulty of job activation versus social inclusion.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, took his first question time in seven months yesterday.  Perhaps his Department of Rural and Community Development could assist in this.  Historically, there was a cross-departmental approach to these schemes.  Maybe sometimes things moved from one Department to another.  Perhaps we could recategorise at least part of the scheme to help with that.  An assessment should be done upfront when somebody is referred to JobPath rather than a person spending 12 months going through a programme which may not be suitable for them.  It may be eminently suitable for many individuals but there are some who may not be a good match.  That should be identified in the first week or two and they should be sent back to CE or T&uacute;s if that is more appropriate.  I understand that Turas Nua and Seetec would be happy to facilitate that.  If a person is working in his or her local GAA hall as part of the CE scheme and is only required by JobPath to be available for one 30-minute session a week, for example, for interview preparation, there is no need for that person to sit at home for four and a half days of that week when he or she could be back working in the GAA hall.  Allowing people to remain on the CE scheme while in JobPath, if it does not hinder their efforts in the JobPath scheme, would be very welcome.  The rules on eligibility and continuation, especially for older people, who present greater complexities when re-entering the job market should be considered.  The rules around the barrier to re-entry if somebody comes off a JobPath should also be looked at.  People should not be prohibited from going straight back to a CE scheme if that option is open to them.  They are some immediate changes that could be made and would be welcome.  If there is an issue with categorisation I am sure it could be solved.  If they need to be called social inclusion schemes, let us call them that.  If we need to go to the Department of Rural and Community Development, let us do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700008#F00600","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1516188000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>The JobPath people, Turas Nua and Seetec, do not select their candidates.

We only send people to JobPath who are jobs ready and need help on a one-to-one basis which might aid them getting a full-time, sustainable job.

It is not the case that, for example, a host company in Donegal is doing only social inclusion and a host company in Letterkenny is doing entirely work experience and activation and, therefore, we could separate them.  That is not the reality.  The reality is that on every single scheme, we have people who are doing social inclusion measures and people who are doing employment activation and training measures.  How do we have different rules for the same people who are on the same schemes?  It is not possible.

The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, on which many pensioners were solely dependent, were maintained.  Instead, the rates for people who had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced.<\/p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are not proportionate with their level of contribution.  For example, a person with only 20 years of contributions over a 50-year working life will still get an 85% pension.  It is estimated that, to revert to the previous bands from January 2018, would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million extra in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million each year thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that, even accounting for inflation, people affected by the 2012 rate-band changes receive a higher rate of payment now in real terms than they would have at the start of 2007.<\/p>  <p>  The national pensions framework proposed that a total contribution approach should replace the yearly average approach to the calculation of the State pension (contributory) from 2020.  I hope to start a consultation process regarding this reform shortly.  Following the consultation period, a proposal to Government will be submitted seeking approval of the new approach.<\/p>  <p>  This reform will make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  It will also have significant homemaker's provisions that will assist those pensioners who spent significant periods caring for their children or adults with a caring need.<\/p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to ensure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and hold their value in the coming years.  The planned reforms will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has examined in depth various options that may provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension had the rate bands not been amended in 2012.  My officials have done extensive work and I take this opportunity to thank them for that.

The working family payment is a working support which provides an income top-up for low-earning employees with children and offers financial incentives to take up employment.  The payment benefits more than 57,000 families with almost 130,000 children through an estimated spend this year of &euro;431 million.  It is definitely working and doing exactly what it is aimed to do.  As part of the process of developing the working family payment, the Department carried out extensive analysis of the range of supports it provides to assist individuals in their attempts to take up employment and move away from welfare dependency.  The analysis showed that the existing in-work supports were actually very effective and were working well to assist individuals to make the transition from unemployment to employment, in particular work supports such as the working family payment and the back-to-work family dividend.  As I agreed during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill in 2017 which was enacted in December, I am committed to bringing forward a report reviewing the operation of working family payments to the Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That includes the requirement to work for 19 hours per week or 30 hours per fortnight to qualify for the payment.  We are working on that report currently and I will bring it to the committee as soon as it is prepared.  I expect that to be a matter of weeks or a short number of months.<\/p>  <p>  The redesignation to \"working family payment\" provided for in the 2017 Act better reflects the nature of the payments.  The Department intends to encourage families to determine whether they are eligible for the payment by carrying out a promotion and information campaign early this year.  I am sure there are still considerable numbers of people who do not know they can avail of this payment.  We will carry out a proper campaign using national and social media.  It is also intended to review continually the package of supports offered to working families to continue to ensure that payments meet the objectives of those they serve.  Budget 2018 increased the income thresholds by &euro;10 for families with up to three children, and that change will take effect from 29 March alongside the other changes we made in the Social Welfare Act.  The likely result of this increase is that additional families not currently in receipt of the working family payment will become eligible for the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700010#H01600","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1516189200,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the response.

However, the Deputy is right; the at-risk-of-poverty rate increased from 36.2% in 2015 to 40.2% in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  I hope we would all acknowledge that the best way to tackle poverty, particularly among lone parents, is helping them find a job.  The recently published Indecon report shares this view.  The report found that the changes to the one-parent family payment scheme made over the last number of years increased employment and reduced welfare dependency.  It also found that the changes increased the probability of employment and higher employment income for lone parents.  The report also concluded that assisting lone parents to enhance skills also needs to be seen as a key objective as low-paid employment, which is something none of us wants any of our people to aspire to, will not on its own ensure a reduction in the risk of poverty.  What we want for people who do not have a job is a job, a better job and then a career.  We need to ensure that the training and support services, particularly for lone parents who historically would not have been working in any real numbers, provide them with a career path so they can get decent paid employment and not just part-time minimum wage employment.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, further budget improvements were implemented and I have continued to emphasise improvements for lone parents in particular.  I hope my Department's social impact assessments of all budgets for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 are an indicator of this improvement.  These show a cumulative increase of &euro;36.75 in the average weekly household income of employed lone parents and &euro;33.60 for unemployed lone parents.  This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;34.45 for the average household.<\/p>  <p>  Budget measures recently announced which will take effect from 29 March 2018, specifically the increases to the income disregard, the primary rate and the increase for qualified child rate, will see a lone parent on the one-parent family payment or jobseeker's transitional payment who is working 15 hours a week on the national minimum wage better off by nearly &euro;1,000 per year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700011#J00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1516189800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's response.

A 4% increase in the at-risk-of-poverty rate is a huge increase and this is borne out in the Indecon report published last October so there is clearly a problem here that is not being addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I agree that the solution to this is getting people back into the workforce but there are huge barriers, particularly for lone parents.

They will read of the very hurtful manner in which this young woman was treated, causing enormous distress to her and her family.  The complete lack of empathy shown at that time by agencies of this State was shameful and is a damning indictment of the institutions of the State and of society at that time.  She was wrongly accused of murdering a baby and was put through an horrendous tribunal, which was meant to inquire into the failures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its conduct of the investigation but which essentially turned into a cross-examination of Joanne Hayes herself.  In the words of Brendan Kennelly, one of our most famous poets, the tribunal was like a \"medieval witch hunt\" with the victims burning at the stake and the crowd dancing around the fire and that just about sums it up.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting that on the release of State papers, people will often say that it was a different era and that everything is attributable to the era.  Sometimes that is true and, in this case, it partially explains some of what went on and the context.  However, even at the time the then Garda Commissioner, Larry Wren, described the performance of garda&iacute; as revealed in the State papers as \"grossly negligent\".  There are also lessons for us today.  There is no room for an absence of professionalism in agencies of the State in terms of investigations, the conduct of tribunals and so on.  Notwithstanding the culture of the era and the mores of the time, there are still very significant lessons to be learned by the agencies of the State today in terms of how we deal with citizens in our society and the moral approach we can take.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Taoiseach has issued an apology on behalf of the State to Ms Hayes and her family, which I welcome.  Deputy John Brassil has spoken to the Hayes family, who are very anxious that their privacy would be respected.  Joanne Hayes and her family do not want to relive the horrors of what happened back then again.  On their behalf, I am making a general plea that their privacy would be respected at this difficult time.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste whether the State, without any negotiation, will adequately and properly compensate Joanne Hayes for what happened.  The State should not put her under duress or force her to go through any process but should do the honourable thing by acknowledging the terrible hurt that was caused and providing adequate, appropriate and fair compensation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700012#K00800","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1516190400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin for raising this issue in a sensitive manner.

I was thinking yesterday, as I am sure others were, of where I was and what age I was at that time.  I was starting secondary school and would like to think it was a very different Ireland in terms of the approach to women and pregnancy in those days.  However, I also accept the point that real policing mistakes were made.  There were also mistakes made in the subsequent tribunal in terms of how a woman and her family were questioned.  The way in which the tribunal was conducted was described as insensitive, very, very frightening, harrowing, quite horrific and shameful by the D&aacute;il committee on women's rights subsequently.  There are lessons here for the State.  There is also a need to respond to the family's wish for privacy so that a woman who had to go through an extraordinary ordeal of accusation and blame does not have to relive that awful period in her life.  Her extended family should not have to go through that either.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to restate the Taoiseach's apology to Joanne Hayes and her family.

I join the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and others in urging anyone with information on the death of baby John to come forward in order that the other tragic element of this case can be resolved through an appropriate Garda investigation.

I express our solidarity with them.<\/p>  <p>  I raise with the T&aacute;naiste the Government's abject failure to provide essential services for children with disabilities who are in the care of the State or who are in the community at large.  I raised this matter with the Taoiseach yesterday following the Ombudsman for Children's damning report on the treatment of Molly, a teenager with Down's syndrome and severe autism.  The investigation found that the State had denied Molly the supports she needed and abdicated its responsibilities.  It found that its actions had had a negative effect on her and that she had not had an opportunity to reach her full potential.  The HSE and Tusla have accepted the recommendations set out in the Ombudsman for Children's report - they had little choice - but they have also pointed out that meeting their commitments depends on the provision of resources.  Other serious issues such as the lack of respite care services and the poor treatment of carers arise in this context.  There is a significant deficit in the resourcing and funding of child and adolescent mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, one of the privileges of being a Member of this House is that we frequently meet carers and groups in the voluntary and community sector that provide services for citizens with disabilities.  Such services should be provided by the State in the first instance.  I commend all those who are doing outstanding work in this sector.  If they were not providing these services, many more people would fall between the cracks.<\/p>  <p>  Section 39 agencies provide a range of vital care services for citizens who are living with disabilities and need hospice care, rehabilitation and various health services.  The funding for such agencies was cut by a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in 2010 and again by a Fine Gael-led Government in 2012.  Front-line staff had their pay cut in line with the cuts for public service workers.  They also lost increments.  Not only is it absolutely unfair that the restoration of pay is being refused, it also represents bad economics.  If these services are further reduced or removed, the citizens cared for will be condemned to a lesser quality of life.  If they end up in hospital or the care of some other over-stretched service provider, the State will have to pick up the tab.  The crisis in section 39 agencies has reached a tipping point.  The Government needs to put in place a pay restoration process for the staff of such agencies.  It has a responsibility to address this issue before the planned strike takes place on 14 February.  If the strike goes ahead, it will compound the crisis that is being sharply felt by vulnerable citizens.  It is not too late to act.  Will the Government sit down with the unions that represent the workers to work out a positive and fair solution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700013#L00300","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1516191000,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I am aware that the Deputy also raised the case of Molly yesterday.

The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, are taking and have taken the findings very seriously.  The Ombudsman for Children's report has been accepted in full by Tusla and the HSE which are committed to implementing the recommendations set out in it.

A joint protocol that has been agreed and is being implemented will result in structures being put in place to support better care planning and transitional arrangements between the HSE and Tusla.

Notwithstanding the new Government, Taoiseach and Minister and the various new plans, the housing crisis has worsened.  To any reasonable observer, it has become an emergency, with people dying on the streets and the number of homeless children increasing by 30% since this time last year.  Declaring a housing emergency is a prerequisite to dealing with the housing crisis in a sustainable manner and allowing the Government to pursue alternative solutions.  While the private market will have a role to play in providing these solutions, public construction of housing, the provision of affordable houses, shared ownership schemes, regulated rented markets and a much greater role for co-operatives will be vital in providing alternative solutions once the Government sees its way to declaring a housing emergency.<\/p>  <p>  Tragically, none of this is happening.  The Government's failure to learn from its mistakes and its reliance on the private market to provide housing, albeit with the full support of taxpayers' money, is worsening the crisis.  I will focus on Galway as an example of what this reliance on the free market has allowed to happen.  The beautiful city of Galway has a population of 80,000 and a housing waiting list of approximately 13,000 people dating back to 2001.  Lands in the inner city, at Ceannt Station where 14 acres of land is available and in the inner docklands area where more than 2 ha. is available, have been earmarked as key regenerative areas, but there is no master plan, area action plan or overall vision.  We are back to developer-led development.  Development in Galway, where land has been zoned and public land is available at Ceannt Station and the docks, is developer-led on the sites that have been sold.  Moreover, the authorities are in the process of selling public land at the Ceannt Station site.  There is no master plan or local area plan in a city with a development plan that demands and sets out objectives for such plans and refers to sustainable development, mixed communities and the development of communities in the city.  A regional plan was also drawn up further to a discussion document that referred to moving away from developer-led development and learning lessons.  No lessons have been learned.  Not one house has been constructed with public funds in Galway since 2009.<\/p>  <p>  At this point, all I can do in the three minutes available to me is to draw the T&aacute;naiste's attention to the crisis, ask him to use whatever legal power is available to him to intervene in Galway and listen to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government which, in its previous guise as the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, set out that, at a minimum, a local area action plan should be developed prior to any strategic zone being adopted for the lands in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700014#M00600","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1516191600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>While the Deputy and I often disagree, I agree with virtually everything she said.  We need to ensure we rebuild a housing sector that can provide social and affordable private housing in a more effective and planned manner and do not leave this task to the vagaries of the market.  This applies to Galway and many other towns and cities.  It is for this reason that the Government will introduce a new national planning framework in the next few weeks.  The purpose of the framework is to plan for 20 years ahead and for an additional 1 million people and to ensure cities such as Galway, Cork, Waterford and Limerick will plan in a sustainable way to accommodate the needs of people who need homes and housing.<\/p>  <p>  While it is true that there is a reliance on the private sector to provide social housing solutions in the absence of publicly owned and built social housing, the Government is changing this position rapidly and dramatically increasing the number of social houses being provided by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Private sector delivery of the homes people need is also being ramped up.  The figures for last year bear this out.  Just 18 months into the five-year Rebuilding Ireland plan, it is clear from the figures that the plan is working.  Last year more than 17,500 new homes commenced construction last year, an increase of 33% on the figure for the previous year, and more than 19,000 homes were connected to the ESB network, meaning that they were either newly built or had not been occupied for the previous two years.  In addition, planning permission was granted for more than 18,000 new homes.  This figure does not include planning applications made under the new fast-track planning system for large developments.  The number of new households that had their housing needs met reached 25,892 last year in terms of social housing demand.  These figures are significantly higher than those for 2016, 2015 and 2014.<\/p>  <p>  It will take time to solve the problem.

We have a housing crisis, but we also have public land in the hands of various public agencies.  When office accommodation and not one home is to be built for 2,600 people, not only do we have a scandal on our hands, but it is also clear that we have not learned anything from this debacle.  I again ask the T&aacute;naiste to listen on the issues I raise and act on them.  I am not asking that houses be constructed tomorrow but that the Government ask serious questions about why there is no interconnecting plan for lands that would solve or partly solve the housing crisis in Galway in the next few years through the building of homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700014#M01000","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1516191600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I am slow to offer too much commentary on my previous brief because the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is now responsible for this matter.<\/p><p>Anyway, I spent time with senior management in Galway City Council and Galway County Council - I imagine the Minister, Deputy Murphy, has too - as well as both together to talk about how we face the challenges that Deputy Connolly has outlined relating to the dramatic housing shortage for student accommodation and social and affordable housing.

I hope the political parties that contributed to the atmosphere of that time and to the witch-hunt of that woman will draw the necessary lesson, that is to say, women should have privacy and autonomy over their own lives.<\/p><p>Five weeks ago, an all-party Oireachtas committee voted in favour of having a referendum on a simple repeal of the eighth amendment and of providing for abortion to be legal up to 12 weeks without restriction.  This was the culmination of a process that was set up by the Government.  Yet, people are none the wiser on the simple question of whether the Government is now going to accept or set aside the recommendations of the committee.<\/p><p>Later today, many young people are expected to assemble at the D&aacute;il as part of the Strike 4 Repeal movement.  They want to listen to the debate.  The questions they want answered are simple.  These young people know nothing of the Ireland that we got a glimpse of yesterday, that is, of dead babies on beaches or Salem trials of a woman.  They believe in bodily autonomy.  They will not accept politicians procrastinating.  They are the people who will actually face crisis pregnancies in future.  We need certain questions answered.  Is it the Government's intention to honour the Taoiseach's commitment for a referendum in late May?  In order to meet that timeframe, will the Government do three necessary things?  First, will the Government move the First Stage of a repeal referendum Bill late next week?  Second, will the Government set up the referendum commission, which has asked for 16 weeks in which to operate?  Third, will the Government publish legislation that contains abortion up to 12 weeks on request?<\/p><p>Four weeks ago, the committee report was published.  Given the number of Deputies who have not had time to read it, one would think they were asked to read <i>War and Peace<\/i>rather than a short report.  As usual, when it comes to the rights and decisions of women, Deputies are wrestling with their consciences in a way they never do when it comes to cutting hospital beds or bailing out banks.  Anyway, women should be allowed to examine their consciences about this decision rather than politicians - that is the reality.  Let us worry about whether people with crisis pregnancies can sleep at night rather than the T&aacute;naiste or Deputies.<\/p><p>This really should be simple for politicians.  As Professor Aralkumaran put it at the committee, do we support legal or illegal abortion?  That is the simple question.  Do we want to force people to remain pregnant?  That is all anyone need ask themselves.  Societal attitudes have moved on considerably.  There is now a new middle ground.  Even if there was not a majority now for abortion rights &ndash; the figure was 60% in the last RED C poll &ndash; parliaments have to legislate for societal need and reality.<\/p><p>My question is for the young people who will gather at 5 p.m.  Will the Government respect the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee?  Will the T&aacute;naiste give a date for when the repeal Bill will be first moved through the House to allow the referendum commission to be established?  Will the Government ensure that legislation gives real abortion rights, regardless of the T&aacute;naiste's personal opinions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700015#N00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1516192200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Coppinger for that question.  I will address the timeline in terms of what the Government needs to do.  The Taoiseach has made it clear that the Government is committed to a referendum, but there is a procedure that needs to be followed to ensure that becomes a reality.  This is something the Government agreed as a three-step process some time ago.  We agreed to set up a Citizens' Assembly, which did a very good job.  Then we agreed that the recommendations from that process would go before an Oireachtas committee, which also did a very good job in debating, discussing and making recommendations.  There was not unanimous agreement but there was majority agreement.  The third part of the process that the Government committed to was consideration, following a debate in the Oireachtas, of the recommendations of that report and making a determination in terms of how a referendum should proceed and what question would be asked.  We are moving through that process.  We are now at the start of the third stage of it.<\/p>  <p>  The timeline for procedural steps, compiled by the Department of Health, envisages a series of memoranda being submitted to Government in the period from late January to early March.  Subject to Government approval of each memorandum in turn, it is proposed that a constitutional amendment Bill must be initiated and passed by both Houses during the period from March to mid-April.  A referendum commission must also be established, subject to Government approval.  Previous commissions have indicated that four months is required for such a commission to do its work properly.  A referendum must be held not earlier than 30 days and not later than 90 days after the constitutional amendment Bill has passed the Houses of the Oireachtas and a polling day has been agreed.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, in parallel we have committed to putting together at least the heads of legislation.  The aim is to try to set a context around answering the question people will rightly ask if they are asked to vote either to remove a section of the Constitution or to replace the existing provision with something else.  People will want to know what the reality will be after that in terms of legislative certainty.  That is a question people will want answers to.<\/p>  <p>  We are beginning a detailed debate in the House this evening.  I do not think we should be drawing conclusions before that debate even starts, as Deputy Coppinger seems to be suggesting in terms of making commitments.  The Government wants to hear what all parties and all contributors to the debate have to say.  Then, the Government will have to make decisions around the Cabinet table in terms of how we proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700015#N00300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1516192200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Obviously, it is reasonable for the Oireachtas to have a debate on this issue &ndash; I have no problem with that.  When that debate is finished, today or tomorrow, my next question arises.  It relates to meeting the timeframe of 25 May.  I imagine everyone would agree that is an optimal time to have a referendum because it would allow young people and students to vote before exams begin etc.  We need about six weeks for the repeal Bill to move through the D&aacute;il.  That was the timeframe according to advice given to the Government before the committee sat.  It seems there is new information suggesting we do not need that period.  That is why I am raising the matter now.  The hemming and hawing taking place from the Taoiseach and many others is not giving any confidence that it will actually happen.<\/p>  <p>  I agree that legislation should be published on abortion.  The reason I agree is that I have no confidence that this D&aacute;il, with its current make-up, could actually be trusted to enact the legislation unless it gets a public endorsement in this referendum.  People should know what they are voting for.  I am confident that they will accept it.  The key issue now is whether the Government will meet the timelines.  It is a matter of a simple repeal Bill.  We all know what is needed is a simple Bill of one or two lines.  I have a draft Bill along those lines before me.  If the Government does not wish to move an appropriate Bill next week, maybe Solidarity-People Before Profit will move a Bill next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700015#N00400","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1516192200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I am unsure whether it would be conducive to the House moving forward together if Opposition parties are going to start trying to force the pace on something.

These are deeply held and linked to people's personal circumstances and experience.

There can be no doubt that we are living in the middle of a housing emergency.  Rents are at record levels.  Homelessness is at record levels.  The supply of new housing is painfully slow.  It does not take a genius to work out that there is a clear connection between each of those three phenomena.<\/p><p>Many people are affected by this dreadful negative spiral but one of the groups most vulnerable to homelessness is those living in private rented accommodation.  There is growing evidence to show that since the introduction of the 4% rent cap in rent pressure zones, some landlords are seeking to avoid the limits by terminating the tenancy of their existing tenants and using some exemptions in legislation to justify large rent increases for their new tenants.  How else can one explain the 11% increase in rents in Cork, for example, or the 10% increase in Dublin?  That has put some tenants in a very precarious position, especially those who are in short-term tenancies.<\/p><p>Under current law, a landlord is required to give a minimum of just 28 days' notice of termination to his or her tenants.  The period increases the longer the tenancy is in existence, but two and a half years into the tenancy, for instance, the notice period is still only 56 days.  It is almost impossible in the current housing market for tenants, or the homeless services that support them, to find alternative accommodation with such short notice.  The short notice period is undoubtedly a factor in the surge in homelessness.  Accordingly, the first item in the Bill is to help to reduce the risk of homelessness by introducing a new minimum notice period of 90 days for all tenancies of less than one year's duration and 120 days for all tenancies between one and five years' duration.  That would bring Ireland into line with countries such as France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany where generally a minimum notice period of three months or more is required.<\/p><p>The second proposed change in the Bill is to address one of the anomalies in the legislation that set up the rent pressure zones.  At the moment, there is no way in which a new tenant can test whether the 4% cap is being applied correctly by the landlord.  Section 3 provides that new tenants would have access to details of the amount of rent paid by previous tenants.  This would ensure that there is a check available to tenants on whether the maximum rent increase charged in designated rent pressure zones is being applied correctly.<\/p><p>The third proposal is to increase the maximum penalty that applies under the Residential Tenancies Act.  Under current law, if a landlord breaches the requirements on minimum notice periods, a maximum penalty of just &euro;4,000 applies.  The Bill would raise that to &euro;15,000.<\/p><p>Overall, the Bill proposes three simple changes to legislation to strengthen the rights of tenants and to help reduce the risk of homelessness.  A wide range of additional measures are required such as a proper cap on rents, measures to prevent tenancies ending because the accommodation is being sold, proper policing of exemptions used by landlords, far stiffer penalties on rogue landlords, and clearer responsibilities for tenants.  We also need an efficient and timely dispute resolution system which is adequately resourced.  We note that the Government has promised action in some of these areas and we look forward to dealing with such legislation as soon as possible.  In the meantime, however, we strongly urge support for the measures proposed in this Bill.  They are a genuine attempt to help reduce homelessness and strengthen tenants' rights, and we urge Members on all sides of the House to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700019#R01200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1516194600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700019#R01300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1516194600,"counter":332,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700019#R01400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516194600,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1516194600,"counter":334,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700019#R01600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1516194600,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700019#R01700","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516194600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516194600,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 2.20 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1516195200,"counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700020#Y00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1516195200,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Mary Butler &ndash; the absence of psychology services for children with disabilities in Waterford; (2) Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony &ndash; the status of the flood relief scheme in Bandon; (3) Deputy Eamon Scanlon &ndash; the position on BPS payments to farmers on Killery Mountain; (4) Deputy David Cullinane &ndash; the need for an investigation into sexual abuse allegations (details supplied) in various State agencies; (5) Deputy Catherine Connolly &ndash; to discuss the response to the recent flooding in Galway; (6) Deputies Brendan Smith, Charlie McConalogue, Jackie Cahill, Dara Calleary, Timmy Dooley, Michael Moynihan, &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Eugene Murphy &ndash; to discuss the urgent need to provide a fodder aid scheme; (7) Deputy Declan Breathnach &ndash; to consider zero tolerance legislation with mandatory sentencing for violent crime; (8) Deputy Frank O'Rourke &ndash; the need to improve mental health services, especially in psychiatry in County Kildare; (9) Deputy Mattie McGrath &ndash; to consider proposals to rejuvenate the Irish sugar beet sector; (10) Deputy Stephen Donnelly &ndash; traffic congestion in north Wicklow; (11) Deputies Clare Daly and Maureen O'Sullivan &ndash; to discuss the recent fox hunt on a housing estate in Cork; (12) Deputy Mick Barry &ndash; to discuss the impact here following the liquidation of Carillion in the UK; (13) Deputy Martin Ferris &ndash; the position on radiology scans at University Hospital Kerry; (14) Deputy James Browne &ndash; the future of Rosslare Europort; (15) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett &ndash; the plans for an agency to build housing on public land; and (16) Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire &ndash; the need for public transport in Cork city.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by Deputies Butler, &Oacute; Laoghaire, Donnelly and Boyd Barrett have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700020#Y00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1516195200,"counter":340,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700020#Y00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Psychological Services","time":1516195200,"counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700020#Y00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1516195200,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, for taking this issue.  I assumed I would be speaking to Minister of State Deputy Finian McGrath, about this because I have spoken to him about it previously.<\/p>  <p>  It is with deep concern that, once again, I must raise with the Minister of State the fact that there is no psychologist providing services for children with disabilities, including autism, aged between six and 18 years in the Waterford area.  In Waterford Community Services, there are 1.6 whole-time equivalent staff providing early intervention psychological services.  An additional senior psychologist commenced towards the end of last August, which is very welcome.  This brought the figure up to 2.8 whole-time equivalent posts, but this increase has still not resulted in the targeting of the children between six and 18.<\/p>  <p>  I have had several meetings with parents, Oireachtas Members and the staff of the HSE over the past two years.  The HSE staff in Waterford have made the decision to aim all the psychological resources at those between birth and six.  As we all know, early intervention is key and the most headway is made at an early age.  I, for one, am not criticising what the staff do.  They are the experienced psychologists but I have just outlined the facts of the matter.  This is an extremely difficult decision for any team to make.  Although the section is understaffed, however, the service provided is excellent once a child can gain access to it.  I genuinely thank the team involved.  It does fantastic work with limited resources.<\/p>  <p>  When a child in Waterford reaches his or her sixth birthday, the service of a psychologist stops.  It is non-existent.  All the good work in the previous years lies dormant, with no follow-up of any substance.  The children aged six are placed on a waiting list and the average waiting period is three years.  This means the service simply ceases for a child in need of support who has just taken the first steps in formal education and who is learning how to cope in a classroom environment and learning new coping, socialising and behavioural skills, or for the parents of that child.<\/p>  <p>  Mothers have sat in front of me and cried when their children turned six, knowing the excellent support their children received previously and the improvements made through early intervention would just stop.  A mother told me yesterday that her son, who was recommended for emergency intervention 18 months ago, is still waiting.  He is aged 11.  Parents are trying to fumble their way through meeting their children's needs and demands.  They are doing their best, hoping they are proceeding correctly, and they have no guidance or input from the professionals when their child reaches the age of six.<\/p>  <p>  Just before the summer recess, Deputy Cullinane and I brought two parents from Waterford here to meet the Minister and HSE representatives.  They said they would consider the issue, but unfortunately parents have informed me nothing has changed in regard to those aged between six and 18.  How can the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE stand over a system in which a group of children with disabilities, in their formative years and who are crying out for help are unable to gain access to services when they reach the age of six?  This has been permitted to go on for too long.  It results in isolation and a sense of betrayal among parents in addition to a sense that their children are not regarded as worthy of services.  The Government, including the Minister of State, does not want to be responsible for this.  Fundamentally, it wants to ensure that all children in need of services are treated equally.  Unfortunately, because the children in question live in Waterford, this is not the case.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I draw attention to this matter today is based on an answer I received to a parliamentary question as late as last September.  The line in the response that is so damning states there is no psychologist providing services for children with disabilities, including autism, aged between six and 18 years and living in the Waterford area.  That is the fact of the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700020#Y00500","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1516195200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I am pleased to outline the position on psychological services for children with disabilities, including autism, in Waterford.  Waterford disability services provide a range of multidisciplinary supports and services for children with disability, including early intervention for those between birth and six, and school-age services for those between six and 18.  There have been significant year-on-year increases in the number of children applying for assessment, including for autism spectrum disorder, and for disability services generally, which has led to delays in timeframes.<\/p>  <p>  With reference to psychology posts, there are 3.8 whole-time equivalent psychologists providing services within Waterford early intervention services to children up to six years of age.  There is currently no psychologist providing dedicated services for children with disabilities, including autism, aged between six and 18 in the Waterford area.  This is due to a combination of factors, including increased referral rates and demand for services ,which outweigh current capacity, more complex cases presenting, and a reduction in trained paediatric staff available to address the waiting lists.  There is also a national shortage of psychologists.  However, every effort is being made in the area to examine the available resources across children's disability services as a whole and find a solution for the provision of this service to children of school age.  There is also some limited psychology service provision as part of a pilot project in Waterford city for those between six and 18 years.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE regrets the difficulties in accessing psychology services.  It is seeking to reduce the waiting times and address issues arising for all children and their families through a number of measures, including outsourcing some services for children with ASD to reduce waiting times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700020#Y00600","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1516195200,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his answer.  I acknowledge he has to read out what has been given to him but unfortunately it states once again that the service is not available for children aged between six and 18.  We are going to have to find a solution, and I believe we can.  I welcome the pilot programme, although it is phased.  It is a small step in the right direction that will deal initially with some children in Waterford city.  We need this programme rolled out across the whole city and county, however.  I definitely regard it as a step in the right direction.<\/p>  <p>  An issue arose over the posts.  There were originally 1.6, which increased to 2.8.  There are now 3.8 but the additional post is only temporary for 12 months.  Savings found in a different department were allocated to increase the number to 3.8, but the post is not permanent.  The fundamental point is that we need whole-term equivalent senior psychologists.  We need to be guaranteed at least six of them.  I acknowledge it is all down to budgets but, ultimately, when the HSE states there is no psychologist available to a child aged between six and 18 in Waterford, just because of where he or she is living, it is very damning.<\/p>  <p>  I do not wish to play one county against another but I refer to Kilkenny because it has a similar population base.  Kilkenny actually has six posts.  We have 2.8 permanent posts and the same population.  We need to find a solution and find one fast.  The only way we will find one is by having permanent posts because, unfortunately, it is very hard for any qualified psychologist to uproot himself or herself and his or her family and move to Waterford if the post there is not guaranteed and is only temporary for 12 months.  I welcome the small steps regarding the pilot programme but I believe the only way forward is to get some kind of guarantee that we will have whole-term equivalent senior psychologists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700020#Y00700","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1516195200,"counter":345,"content":"<p>The Deputy makes very fair and valid points and has always been very reasonable and particularly constructive in her approach.

They covered the provision of services to young people, in particular, and trying to deal with the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, waiting list.  These matters are all connected.  There is a shortage of psychologists.  This is difficult for me and the Department, and much more difficult for those waiting to gain access to services.  To address this, we must examine how we do what we do and start doing it in a different way.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be well aware, a consultant psychiatrist heads each CAMHS team but the reality is that we cannot have a consultant psychiatrist filling every gap that exists.  There are similar difficulties at psychologist level.  We are currently trying to recruit assistant psychologists.  Assistant psychologist is a lower grade.  \"Grade\" might be the wrong word but I refer to a lower level of intervention.  We are trying to recruit 114 assistant psychologists, which is proving challenging.  In the next year, I hope to roll out a system whereby we would operate a scheme such as CAMHS but with lower level intervention services for children across the country, thereby trying to fill in the gaps with assistant psychologists.<\/p>  <p>  This morning, I said to my officials in the Department that I would like to see tele-psych services in operation.  IT has enormous potential in the area of mental health.  It does not with physical health.

One of the core areas in the better balancing of population will be Cork, particularly the Cork metropolitan area.  I have tabled parliamentary questions before on this matter to the Minister, but I felt it was important to tease out the details with him in the Chamber.<\/p><p>The population growth targeted by Cork City Council and Cork County Council is substantial.  A target of 850,000 for the county has been set, with a population of 500,000 in the metropolitan area by 2050.  Significant road projects are planned for Cork such as the M28, the Dunkettle interchange upgrade and other similar important projects which need to be delivered.  Even when these projects are delivered, however, with such a level of growth in population predicted, if we continue to rely to the extent we do on the car as the main mode of transport in and around Cork city, the roads mentioned will be full again in ten years.<\/p><p>What is needed is a real vision for Cork.  No one in Cork expects immediate delivery of light rail or bus rapid transport schemes.  What is clear, however, is that such projects take a substantial amount of time to deliver.  We propose that the process begin now.  The Minister and the Department should express clearly that they are, in principle, in favour of the development of light rail and bus rapid transit schemes in Cork in the interim.  The process of planning these projects can then begin.  While clearly they would be complex and expensive, they are absolutely essential as the population of the city and surrounding areas will increase enormously in the coming period.  The road from Ballincollig to Carrigtwohill, along which the city is developing, is 30 km long.  It requires servicing, but to ensure we intensify development within the area, there is a need for quality public transport.  To unlock the potential of the enormous docklands area in the middle of the city, it needs to be linked.  We do not need thousands of additional cars coming into the city centre from the docklands.  We need to have as many of those people as possible coming in by public transport.<\/p><p>This development needs to be phased.  In the interim, I would be in favour of the Minister looking at schemes such as a bus rapid transit system.  Cork City Council has examined such models in Eindhoven in the Netherlands.  In the longer run that is where we need to get to.  Cork City Council included such proposals in its submission to the national planning framework process.  Cork Chamber of Commerce has also emphasised the issue.  Its chief executive, Mr. Conor Healy, recently stated:<\/p><blockquote>What we need to ensure now is that we are planning, that there is early investment going in and that the Government is recognising the need for investment in transport infrastructure in Cork outside of the traditional modes.  With the scale of Cork's growth and development, it needs a new form of public transport over the next number of years to ensure we are building properly for the future.<\/blockquote><p>It is that recognition of the need identified that is required at this stage.  The initial setting of plans and their development can then occur.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's response.  This is not just a need in Cork, as Green Party and Labour Party Deputies have also identified similar needs in other cities as part of investing in the shift nationally from the car to greater use of public transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700021#Z00400","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1516195800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to address this important issue in the House.  I certainly do not give the impression that Dublin is the only place in which there is a chronic traffic problem and public transport need.  That is not the case.  I acknowledge and recognise the needs of Cork which should be addressed.  They need to be and will be addressed, funds permitting.  My top priority in the next few years is to increase rapidly investment in public transport in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and other areas, while also increasing public transport services.  Budget 2018 provided for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment in public transport, with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion to 2021.  It will enable us to enhance the capacity and quality of the public transport network across the cities to ensure that, as far as possible and practical, increased transport demand will be met by greener public transport.<\/p>  <p>  The need for investment in public transport infrastructure and services in Cork city and the manner in which they will be provided in the coming years is being examined as part of a transport strategy being prepared for the Cork metropolitan area.  The transport strategy will address all transport modes and its objective will be to provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the integrated development of transport infrastructure and services in the Cork metropolitan area in the next two decades or so.  It will be used to inform transport investment levels and investment prioritisation in both the longer and shorter terms.  It will be able to inform sustainable integrated land use and transport policy formulation at the strategic CMA level and the local level.  The strategy which commenced in mid-2017 is being prepared for the National Transport Authority, in conjunction with Cork City Council and Cork County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  It is expected that a draft transport strategy will be published for public consultation by the end of February.  It will include a range of proposed transport interventions across all modes of transport, with complementary measures, including transport demand management, intelligent transport systems and park and ride facilities.  The strategy will be finalised in the light of the feedback received.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that between 2014 and 2017 over &euro;20 million was allocated to Cork City Council and Cork County Council under the regional cities programme which is managed on behalf of my Department by the NTA.  Further funding of &euro;130 million was provided in budget 2018 for the next four years for a sustainable urban transport programme, also to be managed by the NTA, which will build on investment to date to deliver improvements in public and sustainable transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area and the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  It includes traffic management, bus priority and other smarter travel projects.  It will provide additional sustainable travel options to complement increased capacity and faster higher quality public transport services in the main cities.  Funding is also provided for the NTA for accessibility programmes to improve access to public transport in the regional cities.  In the case of the Cork City Council area, the investment has been focused on the implementation of the city centre movement strategy and several radially based strategic transport corridors, linking the city centre with the city's suburbs and county environs.  In the case of the Cork metropolitan area, the sustainable urban transport programme will continue to be focused on the Douglas area, based on the recommendations of the Douglas land use and transportation study, DLUTS.  The principal objectives of the study are to reduce congestion, improve local connectivity by sustainable transport modes and the performance of the many bus services operating through the area, complementing the transport investment made in the city centre and strategic corridors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700021#Z00500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1516195800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I take some positives from the Minister's response.

This is crucial to ensure that we get that increase in population.  The Minister has given the current Department position and the official answers.

The National Transport Authority, NTA, has taken the lead in looking at this and the transport strategy.  These solutions are certainly not ruled out and I would agree with the Deputy that such systems are desirable.  He will be aware that the NTA has made it clear, as have I, that while BusConnects is starting in Dublin, the intention if it is successful is to expand it to other cities, which should include Cork.  I would address exactly the same principles and have the same enthusiasm for any project which is successful or necessary in Dublin or in Cork, and such projects should be promoted.

About a year ago, the N11 became a car park at about 7.30 a.m.  It is now a car park near Kilmacanogue and some of the Bray junctions by about 6.45 a.m.  It is a problem that is rapidly getting worse and thousands upon thousands of men and women, in the morning and in the evening, are stuck in this gridlock and are desperately looking for targeted investment in the N11 to alleviate the congestion.  I have written to the Minister about this many times and I have requested several meetings with him, all of which have been refused, which is why I have had to bring it to the floor of the House.  However, I have been working closely with some State agencies.  In April last year, following requests, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, completed a needs assessment of the route around north Wicklow and it concluded that there was a serious congestion problem.  It helpfully identified targeted investment that was required.  Some of it related to upgrading junctions and some related to a third lane being provided between junction 6, which is the central Bray exit, and junction 8.  The report states: \"Any further delay in investment in this section of the M11\/N11 will lead to further increases in congestion along the corridor and indeed within the wider area; and will further constrain growth in the north and east of Wicklow and the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown area, as a result of reduced competitiveness and productivity.\"<\/p>  <p>  In December, TII informed me that it is proceeding with procuring professional services to start putting documentation together for the design of the pieces of road it has identified to alleviate congestion.  It also confirmed to me that no funding has been made available from the Department to proceed with the work.  We have a major road network, the N11, the main artery for commuters from Wicklow to and from Dublin.  We have a capacity study from the State which confirms that there is a serious and growing issue; a study from the State which identifies solutions to that issue; and a report from the State confirming that failure to invest will not only make it worse but will further harm economic development in the area, but unfortunately we have no funding.  I raise the issue in light of a recent An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruling on a development for the old Fassaroe area for 3,000 houses, an active open space, hopefully a sports campus and community hub and many local jobs.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la gave three reasons for refusing it.  Two would be easily dealt with by any future development plan but the third, which can only be dealt with by this Government and the Minister, is that with the congestion, the capacity on the N11 simply does not exist to allow this to happen.  In the middle of a housing crisis, we have a development ready to go which would provide approximately 3,000 houses, local jobs and a sports campus, but lack of investment in the N11 is probably the single biggest impediment to that.  Given all that, does the Minister accept TII's findings that the congestion is serious and getting worse and that failure to invest is damaging Wicklow and will continue to damage Wicklow and parts of south Dublin?  Does he accept that failure to invest is stopping the development of 3,000 new houses in Fassaroe and everything that goes with that?  Will he commit to seeking further investment for the project to alleviate congestion on the N11?  Will he commit to seeking the funding required for this upgrade in the forthcoming capital investment plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700022#AA00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1516196400,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter of this road, which I suspect I am as familiar with as he is, and particularly the difficulty which he is encountering in representing it.  I feel that what he is saying represents me as much as anybody else and maybe with more eloquence than I have done so far when I have made representations about this myself.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for TII under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.<\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority has statutory responsibility for the implementation and development of public transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area, including Wicklow.  The NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area for 2016 to 2035 provides a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the greater Dublin area over the next two decades, including development of improved public transport links for County Wicklow.  Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  There were very large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure after the financial crisis because of the national financial position.  For this reason, the focus has had to be on maintenance and renewal rather than major new improvements in recent years and I envisage that this emphasis on maintaining the assets we have will continue into the next capital plan period.<\/p>  <p>  The Capital Plan - Building on Recovery for 2016-2021 and the capital plan review allocations mark a significant step forward to restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a steady state condition and allow for some investment in road improvement schemes.  The allocations and planned projects for the first years of the proposed ten year capital investment plan will align with the existing capital plan as supplemented as part of the capital plan review.<\/p><p>As regards the M11-N11, as the Deputy said, a strategic study of this road corridor from its junction with the M50 to junction 14 at Cullenmore was undertaken by TII, working closely with Wicklow County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and the NTA.  This study provides an overview of the measures to enhance capacity on this section of road which could be implemented on a phased basis.<\/p> <p> The additional funding being provided following the capital plan review will facilitate the start of work related to the findings of the corridor study.  In this context, I understand that it is the intention of Tll to add this scheme to the pipeline of schemes at planning stage.  In this regard, I can confirm that TII is appointing consultants to start work on the scheme appraisal and business case as required in the public spending code and the Department's capital appraisal framework.  In conjunction with this, a safety scheme to provide a parallel service road to the southbound lane in Kilmacanogue is being developed and it is hoped that this project will proceed to construction, subject to planning approval, in late 2018.  I hope the Deputy will regard those two measures as progress.<\/p> <p> As regards the timing for the implementation of measures identified in the M11-N11 corridor study, following ten years of retrenchment there are many potential projects across the country in respect of national, regional and local roads.  The scope for progressing new road improvement projects will depend on the capital funding allocated to my Department under the proposed ten-year capital investment plan.  Given the many competing demands, the appraisal and prioritisation of projects in line with the requirements of the public spending code and my Department's capital appraisal framework will be key to assessing which suitable major and minor national road projects can be advanced and the timeframe for implementation.  I will certainly keep in mind the Deputy's representations and, indeed, my own self-interest when I am making those considerations.  That last remark is frivolous just in case it is taken up the wrong way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700022#AA00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516197000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response, which he made in good faith.  Most of the answer is Civil Service boilerplate text.  It essentially says that future investments will be considered in line with the future investment strategy at some point in the future.  I acknowledge that minor work is being done to the southbound route at Kilmacanogue, which is useful.  However, much of the early morning congestion occurs around the village in the northbound route.  There is nothing in the reply that says there will be relief of the existing congestion.  It will get worse.  I appreciate there are demands for capital investment in roads all over the country but the N11 is an extreme case.  Anecdotally, every morning, given every road that could be reported on in the country by AA Roadwatch, early congestion on the N11 features.  Most roads are not car parks by 6.45 a.m.  On top of that, there is a lack of public transport.  There is over-capacity on Irish Rail heading north in the morning.  The chief executive officer of the company told me that this will worsen over the coming years because no new rolling stock will be available.  Most of County Wicklow is not well served by buses and, therefore, the only available option for many workers from the county is to use the N11.  Will the Minister request from his Department or the relevant State agency a comparative analysis to identify where the congestion is worst in the list of competing demands, which I accept?  Which roads are the first to become congested in the morning?  If the N11 is on the list, I ask that priority be given this year to the design and implementation of the works identified by TII for the road.  North Wicklow has been identified as a high growth area.  The development in Fassaroe will provide 3,000 houses in the middle of a housing crisis.  The biggest impediment to that is lack of investment in the N11.  Will the Minister factor that in?  Perhaps he will write back to me or we can meet to see if that can help expedite investment to alleviate the ongoing congestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700023#BB00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1516197000,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I may disappoint the Deputy in some ways.

The TII has acknowledged the problems he has identified in its report and it has addressed them but the problem is funding and priority.  It is something that we will undoubtedly address in the future.  The order in which projects is decided will be subject to the appraisal required under the public spending code.  My Department examines the cost and urgency of projects on a regular basis and it will decide in co-operation with the NTA, stakeholders and myself which are the priorities.  I take the points the Deputy has made.  Five phases are planned for the N11-M11.  The first phase is being addressed and if he wishes, I will meet him and discuss that with him.

For the first few years, the Government completely dismissed that warning.  Now that we have a housing crisis, which has become an emergency, the Government has finally acknowledged it but if the announcement yesterday in the newspapers is anything to go by, far from the learning the lessons of its failed policies which have produced this crisis, the Government continues to persist with its addiction to privatisation and a dependence on private developers to provide the social and affordable housing we need when they patently will not do that because they are driven by profit.  We have been calling for a new State agency that will deliver housing for six years.  We said specifically that NAMA's assets and resources should be used to deliver social and affordable housing.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach said that could be tricky because of state aid rules.  Let us be clear for the public what they are.  They are ideological, market driven rules of the EU which say the state cannot distort the market by building public housing or public infrastructure without private sector involvement.  The Taoiseach says we cannot do that but we can have an agency, which will, according to the reports, assemble the hundreds of sites that are currently owned by the public and for the purpose of delivering housing, these land banks will then be sold to private developers to construct private social and affordable homes as well are as for commercial use.  What on earth is the Government doing setting up a new public private partnership handing over public land which should be used now to provide public and affordable housing?<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>I heard the Taoiseach say we do not just need council houses, we need affordable housing.  I agree, but where is the evidence that private developers or the private sector are going to deliver either of those things?  Private developers are in it for profit.  Average house prices in south Dublin are now &euro;560,000.  What on earth makes the Government think private developers are going to make those prices affordable?<\/p> <p> With regard to the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding the Government promised would deliver some affordable housing, we discover in the case of Cherrywood that it may deliver as little as 2% of the overall development as affordable, and even that will not be affordable because it will be in the region of &euro;300,000.  What on earth is the Government doing?  It is planning to hand over 800 public sites to this new agency which, if it has to comply with state aid rules, will be majority privately owned by private developers in public private partnerships.  We look at what happened with Carillion during the week, where public private partnerships collapsed, resulting in schools in this country and across Britain being put in serious trouble because they were dependent on the private sector.<\/p> <p> I would like clarity on this plan.  I put it to the Minister of State that this is not the way forward.  What we need is public housing built on public land by a public construction company and local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700023#BB00400","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516197600,"counter":363,"content":"<p>thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it is very pertinent to the sustainable development of land in the coming years and ensuring we have the right structures and systems to deliver on our vision and ambition.  The Deputy refers to an article in today's newspaper but it actually refers to a part of our national planning framework document which has been circulating here for the last year.  I raised this issue recently at the Committee on Rural and Community Development because it is one we have flagged in Ireland 2040 as a mechanism to manage land.  That is what we are discussing here and it is what I will focus on.<\/p>  <p>  The forthcoming national planning framework, Ireland 2040 Our Plan, estimates that by 2040 our country will grow in population by 1 million people, who will need at least 500,000 new homes, half of which are likely to be in key cities.  It is vital, therefore, that we implement planning policies that achieve compact, smart growth in both our urban and rural areas.  Drawing on the positive experience and delivery achieved under the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, which incentivised Departments and agencies, in collaboration with local authorities, to pool resources in delivering a major enhancement of supply of serviced lands for housing, I expect that the new national development plan being prepared by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on behalf of the Government will deliver a number of initiatives to support sustainable growth in Ireland's five cities and other large urban centres as well as in our small towns and villages.  This will involve using existing land sites, particularly infill sites in built-up areas, which is a key element in preventing sprawl which is unsustainable and represents a backward step in proper planning.  Central to this will be a new approach to the delivery and location of the homes that society will need over the next decade and beyond.  We need an integrated approach to housing development and management of the land needed for housing, including publicly owned or local authority housing.  We also need mechanisms put in place to ensure a plan-led and delivery-focused approach to securing compact smart growth in line with the national planning framework principles and priorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also recognises that to ensure that plans get implemented and that housing is built in a more affordable way, both by the State and by wider housing providers, as well as being more affordable to buy and rent for our citizens and households, the State must take a stronger role and lead in managing its own lands for strategic Government policy purposes.  Again, we discussed at the Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and at the Committee on Rural and Community Development the need for local authorities to be in a position of strength to manage land and to be able to dictate what happens on that land.  We must not just zone it and walk away, but actually make it happen in places where we want it to happen.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising this public policy need and the need for cross-Government work, the Government is considering the establishment of a new public development and renewal agency under the national planning framework that will work with local authorities and that will have the power and capacity either to use public lands or buy other lands in the right locations for future public and private housing provision that will be affordable for housing providers to develop and for people to buy or rent.  It is not about selling off State land.  It is about combining landbanks in order that housing is built in a sustainable way and in the right place according to the timelines we want and at an affordable price, which is exactly what the Deputy has wanted for years.  He should not try to scaremonger and say it is about selling off State lands because it is not.  It is about trying to manage lands.  Whether we take this route, we have flagged it in the national planning framework and it is something we will tease out over the months ahead.<\/p>  <p>  It is the intention that such an agency would work with local authorities in assembling and releasing key and strategic areas for renewal and revitalisation, and it will have access to publicly owned but redundant or underutilised lands suitable for redevelopment designated by the Government.  Such an agency would also help to create a national centre of expertise in development and renewal to ensure that existing lands are utilised to their fullest and best extent, and in a manner which complements the sustainable planning and development of our urban and rural areas.  The Government will be considering these issues fully in the context of the finalisation of the national planning framework and the national development plan in the coming weeks.  It is to achieve proper land use and land management in order that we can achieve affordable housing, not just for the next two or three years, but for the next 25, 30 and 40 years.  That is what we are about - looking ahead and putting the State in a position, with local authorities, to be able to manage land and deliver housing.  We do not want just to talk about it but to make it happen.  That is what we are considering here and it has been flagged in the national planning framework for the past year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700024#CC00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1516197600,"counter":364,"content":"<p>With all due respect, I will acquaint the Minister of State with reality.  There are 96,000 families who are waiting up to 15 years on housing lists because they cannot afford the prices in the market, either for rental or purchase.  There are 8,000 people, including 3,000 children, in emergency accommodation.  There are 70,000 people in mortgage arrears, many of whom face the possible repossession of their homes.  There are tens of thousands of people who are being evicted or face potential eviction because of rent increases by the private sector which wants to make more profit from the current crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Against that background, the Minister of State is talking about an agency which is going to hand over, partially or fully, public land to private developers who in turn, supposedly, are going to give us social and affordable housing when there is no evidence whatsoever they will do that.  In Cherrywood, as I pointed out, a new town of 8,000 houses is being built.  While the State has put a lot of money into that, and although it was on NAMA land that it sold to a private developer for a song, it appears we will only get 2% affordable housing for the money we put in.  That is not going to deal with the crisis.  There is no point in them building houses for &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000 if the vast majority of people who work in this country or who are dependent on social welfare cannot afford them.  In fact, that is what led to the last crisis, given we had houses being built in their tens of thousands that nobody could afford.  What we need to do is build public and affordable housing on the public land we have and use the resources and cash of NAMA to build public and affordable housing that is not built for profit.  Instead, what the Government is proposing is more privatisation.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example.  Apollo House was sold to private developers and there is no residential or affordable housing there.  What is going to happen to Hawkins House, the Department of Health building, which is another site that could be used for public housing?  What about the motor taxation office?

Section 39 organisations are those bodies funded by the HSE that provide a range of vital health and disability services across the country.  They include some of our local hospices, national organisations such as Rehab and the Irish Wheelchair Association, and local organisations like the Western Care Association in my constituency of County Mayo.  I welcome to the Public Gallery representatives, including unions, of workers in section 39 organisations.  Others are watching in because they could not travel to Dublin, unable to take time away from their important jobs.<\/p><p>Could the Minister of State imagine being the person with ministerial responsibility for disability services without section 39 organisations and their workers?  His job is already difficult, but could he imagine how much more difficult it would be without the work they do?  If he can imagine that, why can the D&aacute;il not give them their proper funding?  They provide essential services on a daily basis, including training and support to families in respite and to people with disabilities.  They make life-ending illnesses a little easier on the patient and the patient's family.  Just as the T&aacute;naiste did this morning, the Government keeps insisting that workers in section 39 organisations are not public servants, but no one can deny that they and these organisations provide an essential public service.<\/p><p>There has long been a link between the pay of those employed directly by the Government via the HSE and so-called section 38 organisations and those who work in the independent section 39 organisations.  That link has been confirmed by the Labour Court many times.  It was confirmed by the Taoiseach to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin in this Chamber on 8 November.  It was reiterated in the manner in which the HSE implemented wage cuts under the Haddington Road agreement in 2014 and previous arrangements.<\/p><p>I have a letter written by a HSE area manager to a section 39 organisation in 2013.  Among other points, it reads:<\/p><blockquote>The clear intention is that all agencies including section 39 agencies are to make an appropriate and proportionate contribution to the implementation of payroll and related cost reduction measures, in line with other publicly funded bodies... The intention is that the menu of options and the underlying principles encompassed in the [Haddington Road agreement] will also be applied in respect of section 39 funded agencies and other voluntary providers and that their grants from the HSE will be adjusted accordingly... It is our intention [that is, the HSE's] to include in service agreements with all agencies, including those funded under section 39 the condition that staff should not be remunerated at levels above the statutory pay scales.<\/blockquote><p>This letter was written on 7 October 2013.  As such, it was clear in 2013 that the HSE was cutting its workers' salaries and that it considered that section 39 workers had to take the same reductions.  They took them, as they also did in 2010.<\/p><p>If it was good enough then to apply reductions, why is the Minister of State now putting his head in the sand and not providing the HSE with the resources necessary to give increases in line with the pay restoration that the House discussed immediately prior to Christmas?  It suited the Government at the time to say that reductions had to be applied, but it is now saying that section 39 workers are not public servants and, therefore, not entitled to pay restoration.  The Government hammered them with the same cuts.<\/p><p>If someone is a home help worker, a palliative care nurse, a worker in disability services or working overnight in a respite house and employed by a section 38 organisation or the HSE, that person is on the pay restoration path.  If someone is doing all those vital jobs under a section 39 organisation, that organisation will not have the resources to give him or her the same increase because the Government or the HSE has not provided the appropriate resources.<\/p><p>This situation cannot continue.  These organisations are losing workers to the HSE and section 38 organisations.  Vital skills and professionals are being taken from them because of the pay apartheid.  Their capacity to provide essential services is being compromised on a daily basis.  As some of them are not in a position to commit contractually under part 2 of the services schedule to a specific range of service provision, given that they cannot guarantee the availability of staff over this issue, the HSE is withholding further funding.  That is a double whammy for some of these essential organisations.<\/p><p>This cannot continue.  Members of the D&aacute;il need to combine.  On behalf of section 39 organisations, those who work in them and those who receive their services, it is time to say &quot;Stop&quot;.  It is time to put a process in place that will allow these workers to share in the pay restoration that their equivalents in HSE organisations are receiving.  It is time to stop passing the parcel from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the Department of Health and the HSE.  When that parcel is opened in the end, there is nothing in it for workers who are providing essential services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700025#DD00500","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1516198200,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this issue, which we have been raising consistently for a number of months.  From meeting with section 39 organisations as our spokesperson on health and a constituency Deputy, it is evident that these bodies, which provide wonderful health care and disability services, will be incapable of functioning if this situation continues.  We cannot have dedicated people who are providing essential services to those who need them being unappreciated in terms of pay restoration.  While we welcome the unwinding of the pay cuts that were implemented in recent years, the idea that we would not address the rights and entitlements of section 39 workers is not acceptable.  It is essential that we address them.<\/p>  <p>  I am primarily making this contribution because of the services that these workers deliver.  From travelling the country in his role as the Minster of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Finian McGrath, knows well the importance of section 39 organisations and what they do.  Across the country, oversight, fiduciary duties, fundraising and capital investment are provided voluntarily.  We are simply asking that the State makes its contribution through pay restoration for the workers providing these essential services.  We are not asking for anything beyond that.<\/p>  <p>  It is incumbent on the Minister of State and the Government to at least put a process in place between now and March to address these issues.  The Government must determine how many section 39 organisations there are and budget for their cost implications.  All this must be done soon.  The matter must be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Public Service Pay Commission, PSPC, if we are to start unwinding the pay cuts and ensure parity between section 38s and section 39s.  If the Government does not do this, there will be a continual downgrading of essential services in communities across the country.  Organisations will not be able to guarantee services because they will not be able to retain or recruit staff.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is getting exceptional value for money.  The many audits of section 39 bodies that were conducted during the downturn showed the majority to be exemplary in their financial prudence and efficiencies.<\/p><p>In my constituency there are many such examples.  It is evident across the county of Cork and the country and every Deputy is aware of it.  We need to ensure the Government acknowledges the importance of the role they play and is upfront on the issue of pay restoration in order that the workers will have their basic rights and entitlements restored, just like workers in section 38 organisations and the rest of the public service.  The Government must also ensure those who depend on the services provided will have an opportunity to avail of them from workers who have parity of esteem with those in section 38 organisations and the broader public service.

I know that the Minister of State met representatives of St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville on 12 January 2017 when they outlined to him the issues involved in pay restoration.  I will speak specifically about how the issue is affecting St. Joseph's Foundation and the deficit in funding.  Everyone must accept that section 39 organisations are doing absolutely massive work.  St Joseph's Foundation has been a service provider for 50 years.  It has been expanding the services it provides.  It is looking at new therapies and better ways to help young people with disabilities.  It provides care from the cradle to the grave.  Its interaction with the local community and the way in which it supports it through fund raising are second to none.  However, organisations such as St. Joseph's Foundation are at a crucial juncture and what happens in 2018 will define them.<\/p>  <p>  We are calling on the Government to ensure flexibility on the block grant section 39 organisations must negotiate every year with the HSE.  There is no give or encouragement from the HSE which is constantly looking for cutbacks, value for money audits and so forth.  There is no doubt that funding for the organisations has been pared back to the bone in the past ten years and what happens in 2018 will tell a lot in how they move forward in recruiting and retaining staff if they do not receive adequate funding from the HSE.  The staff and boards of organisations such as St. Joseph's Foundation work so hard to comply with HSE regulations and budgets.  We are at a critical point and it will be a crying shame if critical services for clients of all ages are cut back because of staff shortages.  We were told back in November that there was reason to be hopeful with regard to pay restoration, but we are now in January and the issue is nowhere near to being resolved.  Pay restoration must be top of the agenda.  I appeal to the Minister of State to take this on board.  This is not just another Private Member's motion; it deals with a very serious issue that is affecting people at all levels and we need action to deal with it.  <\/p>  <p>  There are many other issues facing disability services.  This morning I raised the issue of insurance costs.  There are also issues for service providers in complying with HIQA regulations without the provision of additional funding.  One arm of the HSE is stating the service providers must comply with regulation A, B and C, while another is refusing to provide additional funding to enable them to do so.  This will cost services for people who badly need them unless the Government agrees to increase the block grants to section 39 organisations.  It will not be enough to increase the grant in 2019 or 2020; this is a critical year for the organisations.  I am grateful to have had the opportunity to contribute to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700026#EE00200","speaker":"1283"},{"type":"speech","time":1516198800,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in favour of pay restoration for employees of section 39 organisations.  I commend Deputy Dara Calleary and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for tabling the motion.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 39 organisations operate on a voluntary basis and provide a wide range of vital services such as hospice care, disability support services and home help services.  They do amazing work that, to all intents and purposes, the State should be doing.  They provide exceptional value for money and release the State from significant levels of expenditure.  In my constituency of Wexford there are numerous section 39 organisations which are doing commendable work for local communities.  They include St. Aidan's Day Centre in Gorey, New Ross Community Hospital, the Ardao&iacute;bh&iacute;nn community initiative in Wexford town and the County Wexford Community Workshop in Enniscorthy.  Pay restoration for section 39 organisations should not require a Private Members' Bill.  It is wholly inadequate that the Government is continuing to turn a blind eye to the unfairness for employees of section 39 organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I tabled a parliamentary question on this issue in October 2017 and was disappointed with the reply from the Minister for Health.  In his reply he pointed to the responsibility of those working in section 39 organisations to negotiate their own salaries.  However, he conveniently ignored the fact that the HSE was the body that provided the funding to deliver agreed services which required an appropriate level of staffing to do so.  In many ways, the answer reflected the Government's ambivalence, inaction and detachment on the issue.  When the last Government cut funding to the organisations, front-line staff suffered significant pay reductions.  They suffered significant pay cuts as part of the wider public sector pay reductions imposed by the last Government.  However, staff in the organisations have not been given a pathway to pay restoration in line with their colleagues in the public sector.  Historically, there was a link between public sector workers and section 39 staff and now that the State's finances are in a healthier position, funding for section 39 organisations should be increased to allow for pay restoration in the same manner as it has occurred for public sector staff.  The organisations are losing essential staff to the HSE and section 38 organisations and their vital work is being undermined.  It is vital that the Minister seek additional funding from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to increase the annual funding for section 39 organisations, with the express intention of bringing about pay restoration.  Leaving it up to the management of the organisations to choose between restoring pay and maintaining services for the most vulnerable in society is an abdication of responsibility by the Minister and the HSE.  The staff do work that is on a par with that done by their public sector colleagues and they are entitled to pay parity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700026#EE00300","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1516198800,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I welcome and support the motion tabled by my Fianna F&aacute;il colleague Deputy Dara Calleary to highlight the issue of pay restoration in section 39 organisations which must happen immediately if we are to have equal pay for equal work in the public service.  Wicklow Community Services and the Ardeen Cheshire Home in Shillelagh are excellent examples of organisations that provide much needed support for vulnerable people and families in County Wicklow.  These support services are excellent, with dedicated and hard-working staff.  The Government has consistently washed its hands of the issue and dismissed this unjustifiable inequality for far too long.  This has caused even more stress and frustration for section 39 organisation workers in County Wicklow.  Staff feel undervalued and under-appreciated because of the dismissive attitude taken by the Government.  This means that section 39 organisations are struggling to retain and recruit staff.  Pay disparity is affecting the provision of vital services in County Wicklow, on which many people rely.  It is also placing section 39 organisations under huge financial and service pressures and industrial action may occur in March unless there is a resolution.  It is important to recognise that if section 39 organisations were to stop providing services, it would cost the State far more to provide them in County Wicklow and elsewhere and, in many cases, they would not be provided at all.

We have been listening in recent months.  That is why we have met those I have mentioned.  We know this issue needs to be addressed.  It is a complex matter that needs careful thought and consideration if a solution is to be reached.  Under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE funds organisations by means of a grant.  The service level agreements that the HSE has in place with voluntary providers set out the level of service that is to be provided through those grants to individual organisations.  The value of these grants can range from millions of euro to just a few thousand euro.  I will put the scale of what is involved here into context.  In 2016, the HSE provided over &euro;874 million in grants to 2,240 organisations under section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  The motion we are debating calls for FEMPI cuts to be reimbursed \"as was expected\".  As employees of section 39 organisations are not public servants, however, they are not covered by public service stability agreements.  This crucial point is accepted by people on all sides of the argument.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to be aware that there are many organisations involved in the community and voluntary sector.  We need to bear in mind the number of people involved.  This goes beyond the health sector.  In a response to a oral parliamentary question on this matter in December, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform estimated that as non-public servants, the number of staff working in these organisations could exceed 100,000.  Approximately 300,000 people are working directly for the State.  The State cannot afford to increase the number of public service workers by approximately one third, and it does not want to do so.  The staff of these organisations were not subject to the FEMPI legislation which imposed pay reductions.  Section 39 organisations are not obliged to pass on any pay reductions to their staff members, and nor are they obliged to provide for any pay restoration that may be negotiated as part of public service agreements.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for each section 39 organisation, as the employer, to negotiate salaries with its staff as part of the employment relationship and within the overall funding available for the delivery of agreed services.  All agencies had their budgets cut during the financial crisis and were expected to make savings.  As a large part of the budget of each organisation is spent on pay, the pay budget was the logical place to start.  It is understood that pay cuts were imposed on section 39 employees, but it is not clear how these cuts were applied.  We have heard that different organisations did different things.  There may have been increment freezes.  All recruitment may have been stopped.  The number of staff working in the agency may have been reduced over time.  They needed to do more with less, and this is what they did.  An exercise needs to be carried out to establish the true extent of the pay cuts that may have been applied.  This gives rise to other questions.  If the HSE funds just 70% of the budget of an organisation, such as a hospice, and it is found that the staff were subject to pay cuts, how is restoration to be applied?  Should the HSE fund restoration to all staff in that organisation, but just to the value of 70% of the cut?  Should it fund restoration of the full value of the cut to just 70% of staff?  If an organisation receives a grant of just a few thousand euro from the HSE under section 39 of the 2004 Act, should the HSE be responsible for restoring pay cuts which the management of that organisation applied to staff?<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that this complex issue needs to be carefully managed.  It has been the subject of discussion between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Health and their officials for some time.  I do not accept the claim in this motion of \"passing the buck\" or of \"ongoing inertia\" on the part of the Department or its officials.  Along with my Independent Alliance colleagues, I have been raising this issue at Cabinet level.  There is heightened urgency with regard to this issue because industrial action in a number of these organisations is threatened for 14 February.  The Minister for Health and I are committed to doing all we can to ensure there is no disruption to the delivery of services.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has instructed the HSE to enter into a process of engagement with section 39 agencies in the health sector to establish the factual position regarding pay reductions and pay restoration.  It is anticipated that this process will bring about the necessary clarity and transparency and will ultimately lead to an agreed way forward for all the parties involved.  My Independent Alliance colleagues and I strongly support this move.  We hope it will lead to a resolution and avoid the negative impacts of industrial action.<\/p>  <p>  I have devoted my time as Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities to working on developing better services and increasing investment.  I have had some success, given that almost &euro;1.8 billion has been allocated for disability services in 2018, which is almost &euro;92 million more than was available in 2017.  The Independent Alliance got this over the line when the programme for Government was being drawn up.  I am aware of how hard-fought it was to get this additional funding.  The Independent Alliance is very strong on this issue.  We want to ensure the staff on the ground receive part of this funding.  I am happy that a process of engagement will be undertaken with the section 39 bodies.  We cannot allow some sort of blanket restoration to all these agencies.  It would not be right and it would not be proper.  Taxpayers' money needs to be used in the best and most efficient way.  We should not have it any other way.  We need to proceed with caution.  The Independent Alliance will do its best in the interests of the people who use these services.  We have a plan and a vision for the disability sector.  We want to invest in and reform these services.  We want to ensure people with disabilities and ill people who are receiving services from section 39 organisations are at the centre of those services.  That is why the Independent Alliance will be pushing very hard on this issue.  I strongly commend and thank all those who work in these services.  I want to ensure those staff want to work in these services, are well-paid and are looked after in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700027#FF00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1516199400,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputies Pearse Doherty, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, David Cullinane and Louise O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700027#FF00400","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1516199400,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It is not very often that I disagree with him, but I have to say that his contribution to this debate was quite insulting to many of the section 39 workers, to be honest.  I refer to his statement that these \"organisations are not obliged to pass on any pay reductions to their staff members\".  It is very clear that the pay of such staff has been reduced.<\/p><p>If, the Minister of State asked, the Health Service Executive is only funding 70% of an organisation's budget, should only 70% of the pay that was cut be restored.  It would be insulting to do so considering that the affected front-line workers save the State a fortune by doing jobs the Government, through the Department of Health, should be doing in many areas.  All the pay cuts were applied to them over the years and the unfairness that applies in respect of pay restoration must be addressed.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State indicated he had great sympathy with the workers in question.  They do not want sympathy.  They want their pay restored as quickly as possible and to the same extent as it is being restored for all other public sector workers.  When the pay of these workers was being cut, they were treated as public sector workers.  Now that pay is being restored, we are being told they are outside the relevant agreements and the matter is one for the organisations in question to address.  This is a load of codswallop.  The Government must step up to the plate and recognise the value these workers are delivering to citizens, whether terminally ill patients, people receiving hospice care or disabled persons.

They are people who face all the same demands and responsibilities in life as everyone else.  They are not different, and in a recovering economy they must not be left behind.  That, however, is what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  They had their pay rates cut at the insistence of the Health Service Executive in line with their public service counterparts under the so-called financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts.  The Government, in its various guises, namely, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health and its agents, the HSE, is refusing to restore the block grants to the section 39 agencies to allow these organisations to restore pay rates to their employees in line with what is happening across the public service.  How can the Government insist that the wages of the workers in question be cut in line with those of another set of employees, while refusing to restore the pay of the workers in question in line with pay restoration for their public service counterparts?  It cannot sustain this argument because unless the block grants are increased appropriately, the section 39 agencies will not be able to restore their employees' pay.  The alternative would be further service reduction to those most in need.  That option cannot be contemplated.  There must be no service cuts.  There can only be restored provision to allow for restored parity of pay.<\/p>  <p>  There are some heavy hitters among the list of section 39 agencies.  One could argue that a small number of them may have independent capacity to address the need to restore pay rates.  The Minister of State should make no mistake about this, however, because the overwhelming number of section 39 agencies have no such wherewithal and are wholly reliant on State support through the HSE to sustain and develop the much-needed services and supports they provide.<\/p>  <p>  Section 39 agencies have service level agreements with the HSE to provide services at a community level in the areas of intellectual disability, learning disabilities and sensory needs.  While section 39 agency employees are not public servants, they had their pay rates cut in line with public servants on the instruction of the HSE.  There is no doubt that there is a direct link between the pay rates of these two sets of workers.  This link cannot operate only in one direction.  If a linkage is made when cuts are implemented, a linkage must also be made when pay restoration takes place.<\/p>  <p>  Since the commencement of pay restoration to public servants through the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements, section 39 agencies have sought the restoration of their block grants to allow for the reversal of the pay cuts imposed on their employees.  The HSE has thus far not moved, however.  The Taoiseach confirmed the pay linkage in the D&aacute;il before Christmas.  It is now past time that he translated his words into actions by having this glaring anomaly and injustice addressed by his Ministers and their Departments.  I urge unanimous support for the motion before the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700028#GG00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1516200000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>After reading the Minister of State's speech, I agree with an Teachta Jonathan O'Brien that it is an insult to workers in section 39 organisations.

This is a complete abdication of responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State does not have a plan and he and the Government are behaving like headless chickens.  They do not know what to do because they do not want to do the right thing.  Despite knowing that cutting the funding of section 39 organisations would reduce the funding available for staff pay, the then Government, which included the Labour Party, proceeded to do so.  It now does not have a plan to support the affected workers and ensure they get their money back.  Rather than making a speech in which he says nothing, the Minister of State should have outlined a plan in order that the workers present in the Public Gallery and those protesting for their just entitlements outside the D&aacute;il, which they should not have to do, get what they deserve.

It may be a case of the federation versus the alliance.  I have before me a letter from the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies.  The view of the federation is clear.  The letter was written on behalf of section 39 member organisations that have fully complied with FEMPI legislation as well as the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements in the period since 2010.  Pay cuts in respect of staff employed by these organisations were implemented to ensure compliance with the then revised Department of Health consolidated salary scales.<\/p>  <p>  In 2010, when Fianna F&aacute;il cut the grant, I represented those workers.  We were under no illusions where the instructions were coming from: they were coming from Government.<\/p>  <p>  What did the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, do when he came to power?  He picked it up and ran with it.  He instructed those agencies to cut the pay of their workers.  Now, he is saying they were only subject to a 70% cut or that they were only 70% funded.  They had a 100% pay cut.  They deserve 100% pay restoration and nothing less.  It is an insult to those people for the Minister of State to come to the House and read out what he read.  Day in, day out they work hard.  They do not have public service pensions or job security.  They are entirely dependent on the block grant, as the Minister of State knows.  The block grant funds everything they do.  Caring for people, minding them and looking after them is labour-intensive.  Labour costs represent the biggest chunk of the money they spend.  Of course wages were cut and the Minister of State knows it.  They were cut 100% in many instances, exactly in line with the FEMPI legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing forward the motion.

I am keen to set the record straight on that point.<\/p><p>I welcome to the Gallery my colleagues from the various unions, including my union, SIPTU, as well as all the workers who I have met on numerous occasions.<\/p><p>I listened to the speech of the Minister of State and I have a copy of it before me.  I had a flashback to some years ago when I served in government and sat where the Minister of State is sitting.  I remember when the Minister of State was in opposition.  If he was in opposition now while this debate was under way I can imagine how he would perform.  The Minister of State has certainly done a <i>volta face<\/i>and changed totally in the meantime.  The Minister of State says he knows the issue needs to be addressed.  He said it is complex and needs careful thought and consideration to reach a solution.  Can the Minister of State imagine if it was three years ago and he was sitting in another seat?  Can he imagine what he would have said?  He would not have accepted the speech he has just given.  He would not have accepted the speech put before him which he read with passion.  I have no doubt the Minister of State has passion for the disability sector.  I genuinely know that for many reasons, as the Minister of State is aware.<\/p><p>This is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable that we are even discussing and debating the matter tonight.  At the core of this is the fact that workers who are side by side are being paid two different wages through no fault of their own.  We know there are up to 12,000 of them.  We all know them.  They are in all our constituencies.  I have many relations and friends who work in section 39 organisations.  The fact is these people, who have to be as qualified as their HSE counterparts, are being paid a different wage.  That is unacceptable from a labour point of view and from the point of view of the health service they provide.<\/p><p>This is a point I am keen to explore.  The services are being depleted.  The service being delivered is being impacted by the fact that these people are leaving.  I know this directly from highly qualified people working in the sector.  In one case, a person spent six years in college.  These people are leaving the service even though they have a vocation for the work they do in intellectual disabilities.  They are leaving because they cannot live on the wages they are being paid - it is as simple as that.  They cannot live or hope to prosper or move on in life and do the normal things that everyone does.  This has to be addressed as a priority.  This should be the number one priority for the Minister of State.  He should deal with this as quickly as possible.  This must be dealt with; it is not simply an anomaly.<\/p><p>It is not only about workers, although they are at the core of it.  It is also about the service users.  They are being badly affected.  People will down tools.  There will be a strike if the matter is not dealt with or if a pathway towards dealing with it is not found.  These are reasonable people.  They have been very patient but they have been left behind.  They are going to have to take action.  Is that what it is going to take?  Is it going to have to get up to that stage for the Minister of State to do his job and actually stand over what he believes in?  Do the Minister of State and the Independent Alliance have the capacity, despite all the talk, to deliver this in government?  That is the core issue.  Does the Minister of State have the capacity to deliver something so fundamental and something that he believes in for these workers and the service users?  Service users are being affected because the workers cannot stay on the wages they are being paid.  That is the key question for the Minister of State.  I hope he will be able to answer it in the coming months for all concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700029#HH00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1516200600,"counter":400,"content":"<p>We are supporting the Fianna F&aacute;il motion.  I support some of the points made by members of Fianna F&aacute;il, especially the Cork members and Deputy Michael Moynihan in particular.  Deputy Moynihan referred to one of the organisations in Cork.  Most Oireachtas Members from Cork met the organisation in the past week or so.  Those involved articulated to us that they are in a position where they received approximately &euro;17 million from the HSE.  The overall turnover of the organisation is &euro;20 million.  The organisation gets additional moneys through various other subscriptions.  Already, employers' liability insurance costs &euro;500,000.  The organisation is already down &euro;500,000 on the &euro;20 million before it opens its doors on 1 January.<\/p>  <p>  I support the point made by Deputy Moynihan.  We are hitting an inflexion point where the very existence of the section 39 organisations is being threatened by virtue of the fact that their overall costs are increasing exponentially such that their ability to deliver the essential services is being impeded and impinged in a major way.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The motion before us seeks to address the inequality that exists between workers who are doing the same job on the same shop floor but getting different rates of pay.  It needs to be supported and I was hoping the Minister's response would contain a more thoughtful exposition of how difficult it is for section 39 workers who are seeking to have their rights vindicated.  If there is a possibility of industrial action, it is not sufficient for the Minister to say it has been the subject of discussion between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Health, or between their officials, for some time.  He said the Minister for Health had instructed the HSE to enter into a process of engagement with section 39 agencies in the health sector to establish the factual position regarding pay reductions and restoration.  Am I to interpret the Minister as saying there will be a move by Government to equalise the situation?  The Minister is nodding but is he saying there will be a restoration of pay for section 39 workers?  The Minister has stopped nodding but he is still smiling.  I am hopeful there is something in the Minister's language that gives some comfort to those workers in advance of 14 February.  I was hopeful there would be more clarity from the Minister because despite the fact that, as he stated, there was an extra &euro;92 million spend on disability services in 2017, for which I give credit to him and his colleagues in the Independent Alliance, we are not seeing any evidence of it in the section 39 organisations which Oireachtas Members from Cork met last week.  We need the Government to articulate how that extra spend is translating into real benefits for these organisations because they are still put to the pin of their collar and their future sustainability is still at risk.<\/p> <p> We support the motion and I hope the engagement with the HSE leads ultimately to the restoration of pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700029#HH00500","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516201200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;notes that:&mdash; there are many Section 39 organisations that receive funding from the Health Service Executive (HSE), though the true figure is unknown even by the HSE;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; these include hospices, disability organisations and other agencies that play a vital role in providing key services for communities across the country;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Section 39 agencies had pay linkages, for many years, with the public service apart from pensions and received correspondence from the HSE directing them to apply the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) cuts;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Labour Court has made recommendations on this long-standing and accepted linkage and employers in the sector have conceded on the arguments from the union side on restoration but cite the absence of funding from the Government to meet their obligations;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; hospices receive up to 70 per cent of their funding from the State and are now facing service cuts;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Section 39 employees work as hard and as diligently as those working in the public service and face the same recruitment challenges;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; current pay reductions will have a negative impact on the ability to recruit;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; there was an expectation that pay cuts in Section 39 organisations would replicate the FEMPI cuts made in the public service and, therefore, an expectation that FEMPI pay corrections would also apply;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the HSE are saying they need extra funding to correct the anomalies;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is expecting the funding to be found without acknowledging that this will have a significant impact on services;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; this current position is fundamentally unfair to Section 39 employers and staff; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government&rsquo;s response to the valid concerns raised by Section 39 organisations has been dismissive and has added to the feeling of frustration and anxiety felt by the employees of Section 39 organisations;welcomes and supports the action of workers affected due to take place on 14th February and urges all workers in Section 39 workplaces, and across the health service, to support this campaign for pay restoration;<br \/><br \/>further notes that workers will demonstrate outside the Department of Health on 14th February and urges public support for that demonstration in the absence of clear Government intervention and a commitment to adequately fund these organisations to provide for pay restoration for these workers; and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to:&mdash; address the anomalies and reimburse the FEMPI cuts as was expected;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; recognise that both the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health need to take responsibility for this issue, primarily in order to prevent services being cut as a result of their ongoing inertia;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; cease passing the buck between departments and prevent cuts being applied to services in order to allow staff to have their FEMPI cuts restored;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; undertake a detailed analysis and commit to a process to reimburse the Section 39 employees who have been paid public service rates and who had the FEMPI cuts applied to them;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; fully implement the Finance Reform programme in the HSE so that Section 39 and Section 38 organisations can be easily identified; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; integrate all Section 39 workers fully into the public sector and bestow upon them the same rights and entitlements, including pension rights, as their public service comparators.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><p>Solidarity stands four square behind the thousands of section 39 workers who are fighting for pay justice and preparing, if necessary, for industrial action next month.  The Government and the HSE must see sense before the deadline for the action.  If they do not, the responsibility for any ensuing disruption and stress will be entirely on their shoulders, including those of the Minister.<\/p><p>We have submitted an amended version of the motion for a number of reasons.  The employers in the section 39 sector have conceded the argument in the Labour Court that their employees should receive pay restoration in line with their public sector comparators but cited an ability to pay, passing the buck to the Government which funds the wages of their employees.  The Government's responsibility is correctly the main focus of this debate.  That said, we should keep some of the spotlight on the employers too.  The State provides funds to more than 1,300 section 39, section 38 and private companies for salaries and public services delivered on behalf of the State.  Many of these organisations have a salaried chief executive, and we all recall the scandal of chief executive pay at Rehab, and their own boards of management.  This, ultimately, is no way to run public services, nor is it a way of ensuring people across the State receive the care they need at various stages of their life.  Many of these organisations, with origins in the religious orders, have a record of hostility to or non-recognition of unions and have historically sought to take advantage of the commitment of their employees by regarding their jobs as vocations rather than careers which should be properly rewarded.<\/p><p>There is an element of piety in the Fianna F&aacute;il motion which gives the incorrect impression that the interests of workers and employers in the sector are one and the same.  They are not.  Our amended version of the motion seeks to delete two clauses which call for the strike action to be deferred, as we do not agree with that.  Beside the SIPTU membership in the sector, other unions, including F&oacute;rsa, Unite and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, organise in this sector and the action on 14 February would be much more effective if they were to join the action.<\/p><p>Our amended version of the motion also mentions that section 39 workers never enjoyed all the conditions of the public service in respect of pensions.  I have no confidence at all that the 1,300 or more organisations are capable of administering a defined benefit pension fund for their employees.  For this and other reasons, these workers should ultimately be fully integrated into the public service.  Our support for the restoration of the link, in so far as there was a pay link between section 39 workers and their public service comparators, should not be interpreted as acceptance of the remaining legacy of attacks on public service pay and conditions.  Two-tier pay and other cuts to allowances and premia need to be addressed, as do the issues of the pension levy and real pay rises, reflecting the cost of living increases coinciding with the last decade of pay stagnation.<\/p><p>The current set-up of section 39 organisations is a vestige of our past dependence on the church, church institutions and charities plugging a gap in health care, hospices and care of the disabled.  In the 21st century, this method of public service delivery should be redundant.

Standing up for oneself is crucial in this day and age and it is fundamental to getting change.<\/p>  <p>  Workers have been left behind to a huge degree in this so-called recovery.  In the recovery, we have seen profits, economic growth and property prices rising but the share of the national wealth that was taken from workers and given over to employers and profits has not been restored to those workers, in particular in the case of public sector workers.  Further down the pecking order, the section 39 workers are those who have been penalised the most.  It is no accident that we have seen an extraordinary increase in precarious contracts in all of the sectors, with zero hours, low hours and minimum pay rates being applied.  There is a war on workers in this country and a war on wages, and in this war the Government has supported the employers and the wealthy.  I am shocked to hear the Minister, a former trade union activist, say it is too complicated to restore the pay of these workers.  If it was too complicated to restore it, how come it was not complicated to cut it in the first place?  I do not believe his priority should be getting profits back to where they were in 2008.  It should be rather about getting services and workers' rights back and restoring pay levels these workers absolutely need.  This injustice will lead to industrial action in which we will fully support the workers.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure the irony of those on all sides of this House, including those in power at the moment and those who were in power in the previous Government, who brought in the FEMPI legislation, falling over themselves to support section 39 workers will not be lost on those workers.  The workers can only rely on themselves to get change.<\/p><p>If I were them, I would not be trusting any element of the political class to deliver on their behalf.  There is a force they can rely on, namely, the force of their own power and their own ability to make the Government listen to them and ensure that the restoration happens.  It will not happen by platitudes from the Minister of State's side of the House.<\/p> <p> There is a connection between the crisis in our health services and the fact that we have section 38 and section 39 workers, who provide vital public services in disability, mental health and cancer treatment.  These vital services are, in the main, provided by charitable organisations stemming from the legacy of Catholic charities dominating the health service.  The last section of our amendment calls for all section 39 workers to be fully integrated into the public service and to have the same rights and entitlements bestowed on them, including pension rights, public service comparators and the full restoration of FEMPI cuts.  We cannot continue to deliver services in a society that treats these workers differently and in which these services are delivered differently and largely depend on charity for their funding.<\/p> <p> I know people in the community sector, as I am sure does the Minister of State, who are told that although they should restore the FEMPI pay cuts to themselves as has been directed by the Minister for Finance, they will not be getting the money to do it and will have to cut some of their services.  We cannot continue to allow that happen, nor can we continue to allow the workers be penalised.  The workers do not accept the argument that it is complicated to restore their pay or that there are all sorts of machinations that have to be considered.  We commend our amendment to the House and fully support the action the workers are about to take.  It can only be avoided if their pay is fully restored by the Government between now and the date of strike action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700030#JJ00300","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516201800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is sharing time with Deputies Tommy Broughan and Michael Fitzmaurice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700031#KK00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1516201800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I will take two minutes, Deputy Broughan five and Deputy Fitzmaurice two.<\/p>  <p>  We have a long way to go before people with a disability, their carers and those who work with them feel they are getting the same respect as others in society.  We take very easily to cutting funding for people with a disability, yet even a slight suggestion that we would increase corporation tax is treated with derision.<\/p>  <p>  Almost a year ago, there was a meeting between the Minister for Health, Department officials and the Irish Wheelchair Association.  Certain actions were agreed to try to bring about a quick resolution to this matter.  Obviously, there has not been a resolution.  We know the background, namely, the cut to the funding that was made in 2009.  In the public pay sector, funding is now being restored.  However, it is only available to section 38 workers and not section 39 organisations.  Historically, these workers were linked to the HSE pay scales.  It is unjust that among workers who are providing disability services for the State and are employed by the HSE, those working for a section 38 agency are on one salary while those doing the exact same work under a section 39 agency are on a different pay scale.<\/p>  <p>  The section 39 agencies are, as we know, under obligation to award the restored pay scales as per the various Lansdowne Road and public pay agreements.  Where is the funding going to come from so that they can honour those agreements?  The danger is that the impact will be on services and that there will be an impact on section 39 agencies retaining staff.  This is a matter of justice for section 39 workers.  They were public servants when it came to taking the pay cut but suddenly they are not public servants when it comes to pay restoration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700031#KK00300","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1516201800,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly on this very important motion on reimbursing staff of section 39 agencies.  I raised the issue several times in this House during 2017 and, in particular, in support of the claims of the workers of the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I made several representations to the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform and, indeed, to the Taoiseach during Leaders&rsquo; Questions on 21 June last year.  The Taoiseach, of course, gave the usual disingenuous answer by saying he would take a dim view of any organisation that used its block grant to give the proper increases to its workforce.  I also wrote to the Taoiseach and to the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Harris, on 19 December asking that they intervene and provide the requisite additional funding to the HSE urgently.  I also raised the matter at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in the context of budget 2018.<\/p><p>The additional funding is long overdue following the Labour Court recommendation of 20 November, which found that pay scales between staff of section 39 organisations and public servants in the same roles in section 38 organisations and the HSE generally are indeed aligned and therefore must be restored.  At the end of March last year, the Not for Profit Association, of which the Irish Wheelchair Association is a member, met the HSE to discuss the matter of pay restoration for member organisations and their staff.  While the staff of section 39 organisations are not technically State employees, their pay scales had been historically aligned and during the crash the same pay cuts were imposed on section 39 staff.  The HSE&rsquo;s and the State&rsquo;s refusal to provide additional funding to realign these pay scales has put these vital agencies and organisations under great strain, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has just described.<\/p><p>The HSE directed that the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, would have to go through the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery to determine whether the pay scales were aligned and pay restoration due.  The IWA and SIPTU took part in a conciliation conference which was unsuccessful because of the obduracy of the HSE and the State.<\/p><p>On 4 September, the matter was referred to the Labour Court.  The Irish Wheelchair Association has never denied that pay restoration is due to its hard-working and dedicated staff, who are completing the same work as diligently as their counterparts in section 38 organisations but for less money.  It has merely said that additional funding would be required from the HSE to meet those pay demands.  The IWA was unable to meet pay restoration demands from 1 April last year.  The Labour Court hearing was held on 31 October 2017 and provided its recommendations exactly in line with what we had expected.  It recommended that the pay scales are indeed aligned and therefore pay restoration is due.  I thank Mr. Paul Bell of SIPTU for giving us information around that process.<\/p><p>Before Christmas, a copy of the Labour Court recommendation LCR21609 was forwarded to the Taoiseach and the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Harris.  It makes for very interesting reading, especially given the consistent statements in this House by those Ministers that pay was not linked between section 38 and section 39 organisations.  We knew, of course, that this would be the outcome of the Labour Court recommendation and that those pay scales were indeed linked.  During the crash, when pay cuts were imposed the recommendation was that if workers had benefited from pay linkages when salaries increased then they could not seek to break from those linkages when salaries went down.  Of course, SIPTU put forward this same argument once pay restoration for public servants began under the Lansdowne Road agreement.<\/p><p>The Labour Court recommendation of 20 November stated: &ldquo;The Court has given careful consideration to the submissions of both parties and is clear that the worker&rsquo;s pay is clearly aligned with the HSE pay scales.&rdquo;  The last paragraph of the recommendation is of utmost importance.  Many trade union representatives and leaders of these organisations fear that the current impasse is a delaying tactic by the Government and the HSE and that every section 39 organisation will have to go through the same long drawn-out industrial relations process.  The Labour Court recommendation states: <\/p><blockquote>It appears to the Court that one of the reasons that this matter is before it, is because the Employer feels obliged to do so, in order to satisfy an administrative requirement of the HSE, which is its main funder, rather than to seek a resolution.  It is not a function of the Labour Court to provide an administrative endorsement to meet the requirements of a third party who is external to the case at hand and any process requiring such an endorsement could be considered, [<i>sic<\/i>] to be an abuse of the Industrial Relations process.<\/blockquote><p>This is very clear, yet the additional funding has still not been forthcoming.  The IWA wrote to the HSE on 24 November to seek confirmation of when the additional funding would be provided.  Almost a month later, just before Christmas, the IWA had only received an acknowledgement of the letter.  SIPTU has therefore advised the IWA that members will be balloted for strike action, set for 14<sup><\/sup>February 2018.  The case has been very strongly made that these workers' pay scales should be restored.  They were cut during the height of the bank bailout.  I welcome the motion before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700031#KK00400","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1516201800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Calleary on this motion, which I fully support.  When the country hit a wall in 2009 and 2010, these workers were told they were the same as the HSE and that they had to take the cuts.  They took them, like most people in middle Ireland, while at the same time the Government decided to put &euro;65 billion into banks to make sure they were okay.  Ordinary people right around the country struggled.  Now that things are improving, the same workers under section 39 have been told they are different.

They need to ramp up their campaign if they are not being listened to.  There is a duty on us, as politician, to act.

Section 39 agencies include our local hospices, community and disability organisations and other health care providers who offer vital services to our communities.  Groups like the Marymount hospice do incredible work for our sick family members and friends around Cork.  Community and voluntary groups, such as meals on wheels, the Goleen community council or the Schull community care association, provide social services to the elderly under section 39 funding.  Most section 39 agencies save the State tens of thousands of euro weekly and work hard throughout the year, including during the Christmas period - some organisations in west Cork worked on Christmas Day.<\/p>  <p>  Employees of section 39 agencies experienced the same cuts as all public sector employees did under the FEMPI legislation over the past number of years, although they are only partially funded by the HSE.  Including section 39 employees in FEMPI cuts seemed like a harsh measure at the time.  However, this has now been amplified by the notice that section 39 employees are now not entitled to the same pay restoration as a other public service employees who were originally hit by the FEMPI cuts.  This is not the first time that I have raised the issue of FEMPI pay restoration for public services, in particular our GPs and the detrimental effect FEMPI has had on their local surgeries.<\/p>  <p>  Section 39 agencies provide necessary services to our elderly and sick people and take huge pressure off part-time care givers and family members.  The threat of industrial action by these agencies is a cause of great stress and anxiety to service users, and the Government, along with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, must act immediately to rectify the pay differences in order to deter any possible strike action.  The cost of industrial action to the State is far greater than the cost of restoring these anomalies.<\/p>  <p>  It is simply not good enough that certain groups can be excluded from the Government finance reform programme, and the fact that the Government and HSE has treated section 39 employees with such contempt is disgraceful.  This is similar to other wrongdoings on the part of the Government.  The west Cork development partnership delivered a Government Leader programme for up to 20 years.  When the previous Government kicked it out, it did not have the decency to give the staff their statutory notice or their proper redundancy entitlements.  Instead, people were only offered advice.  The remainder of the company was under charitable organisation status.  We have turned into a great country.  Section 39 employees got up early in the morning and delivered a top-class Leader programme for over 20 years in west Cork, but were treated disgracefully by the Government, just like it treated the issue of women's pension.<\/p>  <p>  All our health care workers, whether in fully funded or partially funded HSE roles, are worked to the bone.  This issue was highlighted most recently in the horrific trolley crisis over the Christmas period.  I plead with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Government to examine these anomalies and restore pay to section 39 employees without further delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700032#LL00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1516202400,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I wish to concentrate on two issues in respect of section 39 organisations.  One is the financial sustainability, viability and quality of care section 39 organisations provide.  Pay is an issue, but the provision of quality care to patients is paramount.  Section 39 organisations supply essential services to patients, which are not provided by the HSE.  They provide those services on behalf of the HSE.  There is an expectation that they will provide the same quality of service as section 38 organisation organisations which are completely funded through the public service.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is the training of staff.  Quite often, section 39 organisations are training grounds for other organisations.  When staff have completed their training, they are poached by section 38 organisations or the HSE, because they have been trained to a very high standard, at a cost to the section 39 organisation.  Section 39 organisations are suffering from a lack of continuity of care and professionals who are providing that care.  Paradoxically, staff are being poached by the HSE, a Government-funded organisation which has reduced funding to section 39 organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Section 39 organisations strive to supply the same level of care and service which is provided through publicly-funded services such as section 38 organisations, yet they have great difficulty in doing so.  There is an imbalance between section 38 and section 39 organisations.  Quite often, section 38 and 39 organisations are working side-by-side and are supplying the same service.  Service users do not care how an organisation which is supplying a service to them is funded; they just want the same quality of service.  When the Minister of State said section 39 organisations were not obliged to pass on pay cuts, that is not quite correct.  They were advised that they should take into account what was happening in the public service and observe the pay reductions which were being inflicted on the public service.  While organisations were not told they had reduce pay, they were certainly given a very strong indication that they should do so.  There is no rhyme or reason for having a discrepancy between section 38 and section 39 organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Collins referred to FEMPI.  It is not just section 39 organisations which were subject to FEMPI.  Self-employed people such as GPs were also subjected to it, and they are expected to provide a level of service as they did prior to FEMPI, despite having had substantial reductions made to their resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700032#LL00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1516202400,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I too compliment Deputy Calleary for putting down the motion.  The nice flowery language from the Ministers of State, Deputies Finian McGrath and Jim Daly, will not help the people in the Gallery and those who protested outside.

They were also exonerated from having to pay the pension levy.<\/p>  <p>  Section 39 organisations are invaluable.  Section 38 organisations also do valuable work, but section 39 organisations employees are being discriminated against.  Many of us have had our loved ones looked after in day in, day out in hospices.  Meals on wheels operate in every town in Tipperary, from Carrick-on-Suir to Clonmel, Cahir, Cashel, Tipperary town, north Tipperary, Thurles and everywhere else.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State might say that organisations were not told to impose cuts, but they were expected to do so and it was demanded of them.  Voluntary boards run many section 39 organisations.  The Irish Wheelchair Association runs on a voluntary basis and has to do significant fundraising to keep afloat.  Such organisations have to pay for insurance and everything else.  We have the dreaded HIQA imposing guidelines on organisations.  One section of the HSE is telling another to do something, but the HSE will not pay for it.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is not stepping up to the plate and paying people.  The Government and the Department should remunerate employees appropriately.  We discussed equality in many areas.  Where is the equality in this?  These people give sterling service.<\/p><p>As Deputy Harty said, many of them are poached, and rightly so, because they are good workers.  They are keen, trained and up for it.  They want to work and play a valuable part in society.  All they want is a modicum of respect.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, might think the Department will get their services on the cheap but it will not because that destroys the community spirit and ethos of the organisations.<\/p> <p> There have been hints that the situation might be sorted out.  The Department should carry out a proper audit of how many section 39 organisations exist.  It has not done this.  We also need to know how many employees they have and the costs involved.  The Department must make a reasonable effort to look at the situation holistically and fairly and provide a roadmap as to how it will sort out the matter.  Fair play is fine play but this stinks.  We have money to bail out the bankers and for many other areas as well.  Let us take, for example, the money the HSE spends on legal bills, PR, and reports that are gathering dust on shelves every day of the week.  The Department should pay the people a fair day&rsquo;s pay for a fair day&rsquo;s work.  All people want is equality with the section 38 organisations and other organisations.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, must act up.

Following that, I moved to a leather factory where I became a member of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, now Unite.  Since then I have been a member of the Irish Local Government Officials' Union, which became the Local Government and Public Services Union, which then became IMPACT and in recent weeks F&oacute;rsa.  I have also been president of Clonmel Trades and Labour Council.<\/p>  <p>  I support the workers in the section 39 organisations who are faced with having to withdraw their labour on 14 February because the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform simply will not face up to their responsibilities and pay them the correct rates of pay and ensure pay restoration for them.  I hope they are not forced onto the streets by the Government and by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who as another speaker said, would be singing a very different tune if he were on this side of the House.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt the work being done by the section 39 organisations extends right across the country and is essential for all kinds of work in the health and community areas.  I support the motion, especially the amendment tabled by Solidarity-PBP.  It is worth referring to what the motion outlines.  The amendment calls on the Government to address the anomalies and reimburse the FEMPI cuts as was expected; to recognise that both the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health need to take responsibility for this issue, primarily in order to prevent services being cut as a result of their ongoing inertia; to cease passing the buck between Departments and prevent cuts being applied to services in order to allow staff to have their FEMPI cuts restored; to undertake a detailed analysis and commit to a process to reimburse the section 39 employees who have been paid public service rates and who had the FEMPI cuts applied to them; to fully implement the finance reform programme in the HSE so that section 39 and section 38 organisations can be easily identified; and to integrate all section 39 workers fully into the public sector and bestow upon them the same rights and entitlements, including pension rights, as their public service comparators.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lot in the amendment but it is essential that what is sought would be done from the point of view of fairness to the employees, the organisations involved and the services they provide.  If the Department refuses to come up with the money, there is a strong possibility that services being provided by the organisations will be badly affected and there will be a knock-on effect on service users.  This is a very black and white situation.  The workers in question have been always paid the same rate as public service employees.  They took the cuts when public service employees took the cuts.  They were told they simply had no choice but to do that.  However, now they are being told that although they took the cuts they will not get the restoration.  That is simply not good enough.  The situation must change.  The workers in question must be supported.  I commend Paul Bell, the official responsible for dealing with the matter, who sent us some information.<\/p>  <p>  Numerous organisations have been mentioned that would be affected by the situation.  I wish to refer briefly to an organisation with which I have been involved from the day of its foundation, namely, Cuan Saor or Safe Haven, a women's refuge.  It is a section 39 organisation that was established in 1994.  I have been involved with it since then and I am currently a member of the board and have been for many years.  The organisation provides a range of services for women affected by domestic violence.  Information, advice and refuge are provided.  Accommodation is also provided as a building was sourced in 2000 and the refuge currently has four units available for women and children who are in difficulty.  There is also a 24-hour helpline.  Support and information is provided on a drop-in basis and by appointment.  Counselling is also provided.  Outreach services are provided in all the towns throughout south Tipperary, in Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary town, Killenaule and Ballingarry.  A very important court accompaniment service is also provided by staff of Cuan Saor.  This domestic violence support organisation that is based in Clonmel and which covers all of south Tipperary also provides an aftercare service, in addition to training and awareness raising and child and family support.  That is the type of organisation whose staff is affected by the refusal of the Department to ensure pay restoration.  It is unacceptable that the services of such organisations, including hospice groups and many others, would be affected.  I support the motion, in particular the Solidarity-PBP amendment, and call on the Government to deal with this matter urgently and to agree to the pay restoration for staff in the section 39 organisations.  Otherwise, there will be very serious difficulties for the organisations, their staff and the services they provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700033#MM00200","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1516203000,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Calleary, on bringing forward this critical motion.

If the Minister of State believes that, no wonder we cannot go about resolving the issue.<\/p>  <p>  Around the time the Rehab group had a number of issues, at the request of the Minister for Health, the HSE wrote to the CEOs of al section 39 agencies outlining health sector pay policy and requesting each of them to have due regard to it, particularly in the case of senior management.  On 7 October 2013 a letter was written by the HSE to a particular organisation which referred specifically to section 39 agencies.  It stated that while the immediate focus on the implementation of the Haddington Road agreement within the health service had centred on public bodies and public servants, that is, the HSE and section 38 bodies, the clear intention was that all agencies, including section 39 agencies, were to make an appropriate and proportionate contribution to the implementation of payroll and related cost-reduction measures in line with other publicly funded bodies.  The intention was very clear.  There was a very direct link.  As staff in other organisations are receiving pay restoration, the employees of section 39 organisations have every entitlement to receive an increase and in a timely fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700034#NN00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1516203600,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I too compliment Deputy Dara Calleary on introducing this important motion.

We have seen that, in government since 2011, fairness has been sacrificed in search of financial savings.

Employees in section 38 organisations are public sector workers and thus subject to pay restoration.  Section 39 employees technically are not public sector workers.  Traditionally, however, pay levels in section 39 organisations shadowed pay levels in section 38 organisations and the public sector as a whole.  This meant that in 2009 and 2010 the HSE reduced the grants paid to section 39 organisations.

This has an effect on a section 39 organisation's ability to retain or recruit staff.  The disparity is affecting the provision of vital services, on which people rely.  I plead with the Government to recognise the unfairness in that regard and ensure pay restoration in section 39 organisations happens immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700034#NN00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1516203600,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I too welcome the opportunity to add my few words of support in order to have this Private Members' motion to restore the pay of section 39 employees carried.

There is blatant pay discrimination against the staff of section 39 organisations who effectively carry out the same duties, engage in the same practices and deliver the same services as staff in section 38 organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Section 39 organisations, like their sister institutions, accepted severe cuts in funding during the economic downturn.  The majority of the cuts were to the pay package of the employees and management who, it must be acknowledged, did well to deliver their services during the recession-hit days.  As stated in a letter received from SIPTU, their members' pay was reduced in 2010 and 2012 directly in line with the reductions affecting their public service equivalents as a direct consequence of an historical pay link.  The historical pay link is the issue.<\/p>  <p>  On 8 November 2017 the Taoiseach confirmed to my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, that there was an established pay link between section 39 agencies and the public service.  The Government and the HSE have been hiding behind the bloc grant allocation mechanism, which is like throwing sheep to wolves.  It was a matter of making the management of section 39 organisations make the hard call on how to divide their spend.<\/p>  <p>  We must also acknowledge that many section 39 organisations have gone above and beyond the call of duty in facilitating the provision of extra services with no extra financial resources.  An example is St. Joseph's Foundation in Charlevill, which came to the aid of the HSE when Grove House in Cork was closed.  While the foundation took in some residents, the appropriate budgetary funding did not follow.

It was communicated that the cut in funding was to be applied to the organisations' payroll to ensure the salaries paid to those in section 39 agencies would be the same as those in section 38 agencies.  That was fair enough, but the Minister cannot have it both ways.  When pay restoration began to happen in the public sector, it was not reflected in the grants paid to section 39 organisations.  Their workers are already disadvantaged because they do not have access to public service pensions.  At this point, they are trebly disadvantaged, with no access to public service pensions, no increments and no pay restoration.  Accordingly, section 39 organisations are struggling to retain and recruit staff.  This disparity is impacting on and affecting the provision of vital services, on which we all rely.  This is creating a two-tier system, similar to what is happening in the case of teachers which is equally wrong.  However, that argument is for another day.  We are pitting section 38 and section 39 organisations against each other.  If section 39 organisations were to stop doing what they do, it would cost the State far more to provide these vital services.  In many cases, they would simply not be provided.  <\/p> <p> This is all about the service users and what they should have.

It is clear from the contributions made in the House that we are all agreed that there is an issue which needs to be addressed.  However, it is a complex one which will need careful thought and consideration to reach a solution.  Like my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, I have sympathy for the workers employed in section 39 organisations who find themselves affected by this issue.  The motion refers to feelings of frustration and anxiety.  I fully appreciate that the situation must be difficult and frustrating.  I represent older people who benefit from the services provided by section 39 agencies.  I must stress that the work and contribution of the staff in these agencies are highly valued and appreciated.  The successful development of palliative care services has been based on a long-standing tradition of positive engagement between the voluntary and statutory sectors.  It is the Government's desire that everyone be provided with the type of palliative care service he or she needs, regardless of his or her diagnosis, age or where he or she will die.<\/p>  <p>  Government funding for palliative care services has increased steadily in the past five budgets to &euro;78.2 million in 2017.  We now have 223 specialist palliative care beds at 11 locations countrywide.  The majority of these beds, 143, are located in section 39 hospices.  We plan to open a further 110 beds in the next five years.  All HSE areas have community specialist palliative home care teams which play a vital role in enabling people to die at home.  Specialist palliative day care is provided at seven locations.<\/p>  <p>  We have achieved much in a few short years, but there is no room for complacency.  Many challenges remain, particularly the need to ensure geographical equity of access to specialist palliative care.  In budget 2018, in recognition of the work undertaken by the charity sector, the Government introduced a VAT compensation refund scheme to compensate charities for the VAT they incurred on their inputs.  The scheme took effect from 1 January and will refunds be made one year in arrears.  This commitment will assist to reduce the burden on charities.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to working in co-operation with voluntary sector organisations, including section 39 providers, to continue to ensure Ireland will have a palliative care service which is recognised as one of the best in the world.  That is one of the reasons the Government is not opposing the Fianna F&aacute;il motion.  We know that there is an issue which needs to be addressed.  As stated, however, it is a complex one which will need careful thought and consideration before agreeing a solution that will be acceptable to all.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE funds organisations by means of grants.  It has in place service level agreements with voluntary providers which set out the level of service to be provided for the grant paid to the individual organisation.  The grants can range from a high value in the millions of euro to a low value of just a few thousand euro.  On the scale involved, in 2016 the HSE provided over &euro;874 million in grants for 2,240 organisations under section 39 of the Health Act 2004.<\/p>  <p>  The motion calls for the FEMPI, financial emergency measures in the public interest, cuts to be reversed, as was expected.  However, employees of section 39 organisations are not public servants and, therefore, not covered by the public service stability agreements.

They need our support.  I think the Minister of State is being disingenuous, or at least his Department is when it tries to suggest that the motivation behind this motion is to somehow make public servants out of these staff.  We are trying to get a correlation between the wages paid to people who do exactly the same work.  The Minister of State and the Department know that the directive issued was issued to ensure that the staff in section 39 organisations had their pay cut to the same level as public servants.  All we are asking is for parity of esteem and that, as the economy has improved, for people to be treated in the same manner.  The work that these people do is extraordinary.  It is done in difficult circumstances and is emotionally draining.  They are under pressure and need to believe that the State is treating them adequately and fairly.  There is an opportunity to do that now.  The Minister of State does not need to kick it to touch.  He can accept that these people are not trying to get all the benefits associated with being public servants but they expect to be paid equally for equal work.

We know there were significant cutbacks across all public services as a result of the economic downturn.  As the economy has improved in recent years, many sections of our public services have seen restoration of pay and conditions.  However, our section 39 agencies are being largely ignored and as a result they are now facing serious dilemmas on the ground.  In my county, Kilkenny, I receive regular contact from section 39 agencies on this matter.  One such agency, SOS Kilkenny, which I welcome to the Public Gallery, provides a vital life service to people in need of service for disabilities and of palliative care and greatly enhances the quality of life through opportunities of social inclusion for their service users.  This is very important work.  It has endured an annual financial deficit of &euro;100,000 for some time and has begged, borrowed and stolen to hang on to its very talented and passionate staff and keep the show on the road.  That has been happening for four or five years.  This position is simply not sustainable and such problems are being echoed all across the section 39 sector.  We must enable section 39 agencies to be able to pay and look after their staff.  These workers are very well trained and have a genuine vocation for the important work they do and we must keep them and pay them what they are worth.  We cannot afford to lose them because they cannot afford to live on what they are being paid.  It is an unthinkable situation in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  We must also remember the service users all across the country whose lives are greatly improved as a result of the crucial work done by our section 39 agencies and workers.  They are the ones who will ultimately suffer a downgrade or interruption in services and a lowering of general standards if we cannot hang on to the great staff we have in this sector.  They are well-educated, well-trained passionate people who do crucial work.  We are reliably informed that section 39 workers are being headhunted and pinched from the agencies they work for because the agencies cannot afford to offer them the same level of pay and benefits that are offered elsewhere.  That includes the HSE, which is pilfering employees from section 39 agencies because it is able to pay more money since its increments were improved.  It is important to point out that if we end up in a situation in which services are interrupted or removed, it will become the responsibility of the State to care for the service users which will ultimately cost more than pay restoration and equality.  I hope the Minister of State will take these concerns into consideration.  If we lose these services, they will come back on to the State and cost the taxpayer more in the long run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700036#PP00300","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1516204800,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues for speaking in this debate on all sides.

They think that they are not the Ministers of State in charge of the Department, that one is not the Minister of State with responsibility for older persons and the other is not the Minister of State with responsibility for disability services, based on the response the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, gave this evening.  He repeated the line that section 39 organisations are not obliged to pass on any pay reductions to their staff members, absolutely ignoring the instruction from the HSE to organisations in 2013 to apply reductions directly to staff costs.  The Minister of State spoke about complexity and how we would recompense staff.  I suggest that he recompenses them in line with the comment that section 39 organisations are to make an appropriate, proportionate contribution to the implementation of payroll and related cost reduction measures.<\/p>  <p>  May I suggest that the Government make an appropriate and proportionate contribution to the implementation of pay restoration measures in the same fashion that it instructed organisations to in 2013?  That would solve that conundrum.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, was slightly detached from the notion that the industrial action pending on 14 February has something to do with him.  He made the plaintive cry that we should try to resolve that.  He is the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and Deputy Daly is the Minister of State with responsibility for older persons' services.  They can do something about it and actually take action on this motion this evening.  They should not treat it like they treat all other Private Members' motions where they know that they will lose it so they will let it through and do nothing about it.  They should do something about this one.  I will hold the Ministers of State to do something about this.  If those workers who work so hard in section 39 organisations decide they have no other option on 14 February, Valentine's Day, but to go to the picket lines, on the Ministers' watch be it.  On their watch be it where families and services will be impacted and where communities will have their services impacted.  The Ministers of State keep parroting the line that these staff are not public servants and have nothing to do with financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI.  That is the evidence that they have.  They were good enough to be instructed to take a pay cut but the Minister of State does not want to hear about them when it concerns pay restoration.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister of State's sentiments about palliative care.  We acknowledge the enormous improvements that have happened in palliative care but tonight there will be palliative care nurses in the last minutes and last hours of patients' lives.  They will be there with distraught families.  When they go and get their pay cheque tomorrow or tomorrow week, it will be less than what they would have got had they been employed by the HSE.  They do amazing work and the Minister of State is right to point to the development but if he is that committed to and that passionate about palliative care, then pay the nurses properly.  Pay the disability workers properly and the people who will spend nine or ten hours tonight in a respite house with people with a disability.  Respect them not with just words or platitudes, but in their pay cheque.  Respect their qualifications as professionals.  They get up early in the morning.  The Minister of State's leader is fond of that phrase.  They go to bed late at night.  The difference for them is that while they have the Government's platitudes, they do not have its money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700036#PP00400","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516204800,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516204800,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Report of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution: Statements","time":1516205400,"counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700037#QQ00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1516205400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Every now and then an issue comes before us which challenges us to think about what kind of a country we want to be and what kind of a society we are; an issue that we struggle with, that may be difficult to talk about, but that is not going to go away.  Today is a moment where we, the Members of the 32nd D&aacute;il, come face to face again with such an issue.  In doing so, we come face to face with our history - a history that continues to unfold and continues to hold up a mirror in which we sometimes do not like what we see, whether it is the damp cold of the Magdalen laundries creeping into our bones, or the sundered silence of mother and baby homes being broken, or the glimpses of what was an all too acceptable culture exposed by the Kerry babies case.  All these are connected by the way we as a country have treated women, and particularly the way we have treated pregnant women.<\/p>  <p>  I think of another cold January like this one in 1984 when the 15 year-old Ann Lovett gave birth alone to her son beneath a statue of Our Lady.  The death of Ann and her baby son in these stark and lonely circumstances is a memory that chills us still and one we should not forget.  We now arrive at another moment on a long journey, starting with the insertion of the eighth amendment of the Constitution in 1983 through the court cases that made us think about the pregnant victims of rape and incest, through the bravery of families faced with fatal foetal abnormalities who made us think about the particular cruelties we add to their tragedies, and, after all this, perhaps arriving at the realisation that each crisis pregnancy is different and each involves a real woman facing a very difficult and very personal decision.<\/p>  <p>  These are real women such as the 36 from County Carlow who travelled to the UK for an abortion in 2016, or the 38 from Mayo, the 69 from Tipperary, the 85 from Wicklow, the 241 from Cork and the 1,175 women from Dublin.  Women from every county in the Republic travelled to the UK in 2016 and we need to acknowledge them all, including the 49 from Kerry; 130 from Kildare; 21 from Leitrim; 20 from Roscommon; 69 from Wexford; 39 from Cavan; 15 from Monaghan; 99 from Limerick; 53 from Clare; 38 from Westmeath; 63 from Donegal; 113 from Galway; 44 from Kilkenny; 42 from Laois; 83 from Louth; 100 from Meath; 28 from Offaly; 29 from Sligo; 16 from Longford; and 56 from Waterford.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, 3,265 Irish women travelled to the UK alone and we know that Irish women travel to other countries such as the Netherlands as well.  More than 1,200 of the women who went to the UK were aged between 30 and 39; more than 1,500 were aged between 20 and 29; 255 were aged 40 or over; ten were girls under the age of 16; and 230 were teenagers.  More than half of the women who travelled were married, in a civil partnership, or in a relationship while 85% of them were between three and 12 weeks' pregnant.  It is estimated that at least 170,000 Irish women have travelled to other countries for abortions since 1980.<\/p>  <p>  These are not faceless women.  It might be convenient for us sometimes to think that they are.  They are our friends, neighbours, sisters, cousins, mothers, aunts, and wives.  Each woman is dealing with her own personal situation and making what is a deeply difficult decision because this time around - let us be honest about this &ndash; this is not a decision or a procedure that anyone undertakes lightly.  Women agonise about it and consider every possibility for dealing with the particular crisis facing them, and sometimes they arrive at the conclusion that there is no other option for them but to terminate their pregnancy.  When they arrive at that difficult decision, the country we live in, which we hope has come a long way from the dark events that continue to haunt this Chamber, tells them to go and get their care elsewhere - go to another country or head off somewhere else.<\/p>  <p>  In 1992, we formalised the right of Irish women to travel for an abortion and to obtain information about it, but we have been temporarily exporting women in crisis for an awful lot longer than that.  I cannot help but wonder what we would have done if we did not have a neighbouring island to help us turn a blind eye.  Sometimes turning a blind eye is the same as turning your back.  We need now to seek to build a society which accepts our own challenges and addresses them honestly, maturely and openly, which does not seek to deny reality or to outsource it to another country, and which does not reject women at the most vulnerable moments in their lives.<\/p>  <p>  As I stand before this House at the commencement of what I genuinely believe in time could be seen as an historic debate, I am fully aware of the sensitivities and complexities of this issue.  I want to acknowledge the deeply held, genuine views on all sides of the House and throughout the country.  No matter what may divide us, I accept that all of us are trying to do what is right.  All of us are guided by our own conscience and our own sense of humanity.  Some of us have changed our views over the years.  My own views have changed and been formed by listening to women and doctors, and coming to recognise some hard realities.  Some of us bear the scars of past debates and fear what is to come.  However, this time, I firmly believe that it is possible for us to have a respectful debate on the issue.  Please do not call that na&iuml;ve and do not dismiss the idea that we can maturely recognise that each of us has deeply personal and genuinely held views, all of which deserve to be heard, understood and respected.  It is an issue that troubles most of us as individuals.  For some of us, it challenges us to hold what appear to be conflicting views simultaneously.  Which of us does not value and love human life, and which of us does not want to see that protected?  No one has a monopoly on that.  The tactics name-calling, pigeon-holing, and stereotyping need to be consigned to history because they have only led to paralysis, fear and division.<\/p>  <p>  It will require effort and attention from all of us, regardless of our views, but it is so important that everyone has the chance to hear clearly in order that when, as a nation, we come to make the next decision on this issue, it is informed.<\/p><p>We do so as a country with a particularly complex past which, in fact, dates back to 1861, when abortion was a felony under the Offences against the Person Act, a felony with a sentence of penal servitude for life.  In more recent decades, it has been an issue dominated by referendums and court cases.  As Members know, 1983 saw the first referendum.  In 1992 there was another with three questions.  Legislation followed in 1995.  A third referendum on abortion was held in 2002 seeking to overturn the X case but it was defeated.  In 2014 the issue came before this House again when we passed the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.<br\/><br\/>I remember vividly that debate and some of the offensive comments about floodgates opening.  I remember the language used, which seemed to suggest women would even fake a threat to their own lives to obtain a termination - quite unbelievable really, when we look back only those few short years.  Obviously, none of this has come to pass and the reports laid before this House each year bear that out.<br\/><br\/>Since the passing of that law there has been a clear legal basis for abortion in Ireland but it has become clear that the Oireachtas can go no further without constitutional change.  Other Members have tried to bring forward thoughtful legislation to assist families with a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality, for example.  I have been the Minister to respond to these Private Members' Bills but on each occasion the legal advice has been clear that without the repeal of the eighth amendment, we, as an Oireachtas, could not address these issues.<br\/><br\/>Abortion is a reality for women living in Ireland but not just women in the limited circumstances in which it is legal under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, nor for the many women who travel to other countries, as I have outlined.  There are now new realities on top of that.  The Oireachtas committee heard evidence of abortion pills being bought on the Internet and used by women in this country without any medical supervision.  Research from the <i>British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology<\/i>shows a 62% increase in the number of women from Ireland contacting one online provider over a five-year period, up from 548 women in 2010 to 1,438 in 2015, and that is just one provider.<br\/><br\/>Can we pause and picture what this is telling us, because we can get lost in numbers and years?  Is it acceptable to any of us that women are once again left in a lonely and scary place, sending off for a pill to be sent through the post instead of being able to access the medical advice and support they need?  This is happening in Ireland today.  It is a fact.  How can we ignore it?  How can we consider it to be all right?  If it is the sad reality that we have been exporting this issue for many decades, are we now accepting that, on top of exporting it, women must import their own solutions?<br\/><br\/>I want to turn now to the substance of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  I commend all the members for their work and thank them for the contributions they made.  They have served the Oireachtas well.  I wish to thank Senator Catherine Noone, in particular, for her calm and balanced handling of the issue as Chair.  We, as an Oireachtas, asked these colleagues, on a cross-party basis, to do a very important body of work: to listen to experts, to hear evidence and to report back to us.  We owe them a debt of gratitude for the time and dedication they applied to their task.  I would also like to commend the chair of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, and its members for their careful deliberations and to acknowledge their valuable contribution.<br\/><br\/>The Citizens' Assembly and the committee have given us a model for addressing this issue in a rational and measured way, and I believe it is one we should follow.  I want to recognise that the recommendations contained in the committee&rsquo;s report represent the views of the majority of members but there was not unanimous agreement on them.  I respect the views of those who dissented from the recommendations but I believe the recommendations are the basis on which we must proceed on this issue.  The main conclusion of the committee&rsquo;s work is that change is needed to extend the grounds for lawful termination of pregnancy in the State.  In order to effect that change, the committee recommended that Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>should be removed from the Constitution.  The committee then went on to make recommendations on the grounds on which termination of pregnancy should be permitted in Ireland, if Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>is repealed by the Irish people.  It recommended extending the law on abortion to cover cases where the health of a woman is concerned, cases of fatal foetal abnormalities and a broader legal regime that allows abortions where the woman seeks it from her medical practitioner if her pregnancy is under 12 weeks gestation.<br\/><br\/>I am working with my chief medical officer and officials of my Department, and the Attorney General, to consider how best to translate these recommendations into legislation, should that be the wish of the Irish people.  It is my intention that, in the event of a referendum, as much information as possible would be available to people so they can make an informed decision.<br\/><br\/>While it is understandable the focus so far has been on the committee&rsquo;s recommendations regarding the eighth amendment, it is important to put on the record of the House that the committee did not only make recommendations on termination of pregnancy, but also on the services and supports that should be available to women.  I am fully committed to ensuring that all women accessing maternity services in our country should receive the same standard of safe, high quality care.  Every woman, from any corner of Ireland, should expect and be able to access the maternity services she needs.  I am confident that, through the implementation of the first-ever national maternity strategy, Creating a Better Future Together, the quality outcomes envisaged by the committee will be realised.  In some ways, it is incredible it is the first-ever national maternity strategy.  Officials in my Department, under the chairmanship of the chief medical officer, have now established a group to address and formulate an effective and comprehensive response to the issues raised by the committee in its ancillary recommendations.<br\/><br\/>We have made other progress which provides the base for delivering the kind of integrated care women and their babies deserve.  We have established the national women and infants health programme.  We now have HIQA&rsquo;s standards for safer better maternity services and new HSE national standards for bereavement care to ensure clinical and counselling services are in place to support all women and families in all pregnancy loss situations.  The HSE&rsquo;s Positive Options crisis pregnancy counselling service is also available in 50 centres nationwide.<br\/><br\/>As someone born three years after the 1983 referendum on the eighth amendment, I never imagined I might one day be the Minister for Health responsible for a referendum on its repeal.  I come at it from a perspective that I think was sadly absent in 1983, that is, from the perspective of women&rsquo;s health care.  In the Ministry I have the honour to hold, it is my duty to work to ensure that people in this country receive the highest possible standards of care, and to protect and promote the health of our people under the laws of our land.<br\/><br\/>I realise the issue before us challenges us - it challenges me.  It causes us to ask difficult questions of ourselves.  It makes us uncomfortable at times as we collectively wrestle with what is, at its core, a very personal and private matter.  Women become pregnant and it is a joyous thing for so many, but it is a terrifying thing for some and a tragic thing for others.  Irish women are driven today to find their own solutions.  Sometimes they put themselves at risk in doing so.  As things stand, they are often left without help, advice or support at one of the most vulnerable times in their lives.  I hope that, as a country, we can no longer tolerate a law which denies care and understanding to women who are our friends, our sisters, our mothers, our daughters, our wives.  Ultimately, there is always a deeply personal, private story behind each individual case, which I believe is a matter best served by women and their doctors.  I believe the people in this country trust women and trust their doctors to make these difficult decisions.<br\/><br\/>I look forward to what I hope will be a constructive debate on the issues raised by the committee here and in the Seanad.  I hope we can show here that this debate can take place in an atmosphere of respect for each other's views so that the same is possible in the context of a referendum campaign.  After this debate concludes, I expect to return to Government in the coming weeks with a series of proposals which I believe can deliver a referendum by the end of May or very early June, should the will of the Oireachtas be to facilitate that.  I do not doubt that, as long as I remain a Member of this House, I will continue to witness moments in this Chamber that remind us of darker times in our history, but let this be a different type of moment.  Let this be a moment people will look back on as one where their representatives confronted one of the most complex issues we have faced as a country with clarity, with compassion and with care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700037#QQ00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516206600,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this divisive issue, which has been at the heart of debate since 1983 and the insertion of Article 40.3.3&deg; into the Constitution.

All of this indicates that there is a large swathe of people who have never had an opportunity to cast an opinion on this issue.  It should be borne in mind that it is primarily women of childbearing age who are most affected, yet they have never had an opportunity to cast their view.<\/p><p>Since being appointed Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on health, I have been grappling with this issue.  We debated it in the context of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  I sat on the committee chaired by now Senator Buttimer that formulated that debate.  It was insightful because that was the first time that we as an Oireachtas tried to deal with the issue in a non-political way, recognising that it was socially divisive and people had strong feelings on it.<\/p><p>My leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, subsequently allowed us a free vote - a vote of conscience.  Some parties have followed us in that while others have not.  That is entirely their entitlement.  It is not for me to say whether they should or should not.  Since being appointed health spokesperson, I have tried to take the political element out of this issue, given that it has been charged for a long time and has occasionally been used by political parties of all persuasions and none.  We have gone beyond that now.  Our society is mature enough to have a respectful, incisive and decisive debate on this issue, with the people ultimately deciding.<\/p><p>I also sat on the joint Oireachtas committee.  I pay tribute to the Citizens' Assembly, chaired by Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, who outlined the assembly's workings and the reasoning behind its conclusions and recommendations.  Our committee was charged by the Oireachtas to examine those recommendations and reach our own determinations.<\/p><p>The committee did not reach a unanimous view.  Rather, there was a majority view and a dissenting view, with varying views even within those.  I respect every one of those views.  If we are to allow the people the space to grapple with this issue, we in this Chamber must equally acknowledge that people have deeply held views - morally, ethically and even religiously.<\/p><p>That aside, my personal or political discomfort is nothing compared with the discomfort caused to women every day of the week who are grappling with crisis or unwanted pregnancies or the devastating news of fatal foetal abnormalities.  We must be conscious of that.<\/p><p>The Minister outlined that 170,000 plus women had left this State for terminations.  We have been exporting our problem for a long time.  It is our duty to address this issue.  With the best will in the world, and although people have varying opinions on this, we cannot do anything other than what we have legislated for already unless we repeal, amend or replace Article 40.3.3&deg;.  We have to change what is in our Constitution.  That will be the first step towards addressing this issue.<\/p><p>It would be easy for me and others contributing in this debate to keep our heads down and hope that the issue goes away but, as a generation of politicians, we have to deal with it.  We have to give the people an opportunity to express their opinion in light of the fact that the last time they had such an opportunity was in 1983.  Ireland has fundamentally changed in many respects since then, as outlined by the Minister.  It has changed most in how women have become more assertive.  They now have an opportunity to put themselves at the heart of this debate, which is primarily about women's rights and health care and about giving them equal opportunity in the Republic.  We cannot have a situation in which a woman becomes a second-class citizen upon becoming pregnant.  We must understand that that is no longer acceptable.<\/p><p>People have asked me how the committee arrived at our recommendations.  The Citizens' Assembly made 13 recommendations, the most fundamental one being that there should be a change to Article 40.3.3&deg;.  The assembly outlined three options.  The committee's majority recommendation was for a repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>, that is, the article should just be removed from the Constitution, and for the Houses of the Oireachtas to be allowed to legislate for what was primarily a health care issue for women.  There were varying views on that in the legal advice that the committee sought and was given.  I am sure that different advice may even be given to the Government by the Attorney General.  What I do know, however, is that if we continue allowing Article 40.3.3&deg; to be the bulwark for dealing with this issue, the <i>status quo<\/i>will prevail.  Every night, four or five women will self-administer abortion pills at home and ten women will get on planes every day to fly abroad.  We as a Parliament will have to live with that if we fail to grasp this issue.<\/p><p>We must show political leadership by having a debate that is respectful of every view that will be expressed in this Chamber and then allowing the people to make their decision based on the full information.  I urge everyone involved not only to respect one another's views, but to engage in the debate so that the question can be decided one way or the other.<\/p><p>I have expressed my view that there must be a repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>or a variation of same that removes Article 40.3.3&deg; from the Constitution.  I am open to a new constitutional article giving the Oireachtas the supreme authority to legislate on this issue.  I would take on board the Attorney General's opinion and that of others.  However, we must be honest with people.  If Article 40.3.3&deg; is replaced or repealed, the Legislature will govern from then on, but we cannot guarantee anything.  We could publish legislation in advance of this referendum campaign that would give people guidance as to what the likely outcome would be, but if the Oireachtas is to legislate in the event of a repeal, then it will be the Oireachtas that will decide, not necessarily this one either, but possibly a changed Oireachtas following a general election.  All we can do is be honest with people about what we believe the Oireachtas in its current composition would pass in the event of a repeal.<\/p><p>I urge people to examine the committee's recommendations and consider why we came to those determinations.  They are more conservative than the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  For example, the assembly referred to a 22 week gestational period whereas we are calling for a 12 week period in the majority of cases.  It would be a matter for the clinicians and the woman with a view to her health and life.<\/p><p>Many people have stated their desire to address the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities.  I have a friend whose wife received a diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality.  They wanted to have this child.  They kicked the sand up and down Garryvoe beach for weeks on end because of that diagnosis wondering what they would do.  Would she continue with the pregnancy or would she have it terminated?  They spent weeks deciding.  If they decided to terminate the pregnancy, given that there could have been no survival outside of the womb, the only difficulty would have been that they would have had to go abroad.  They made the decision to go abroad.  It was inhumane that our country could force this on our citizens.  They decided to terminate the pregnancy because they felt that they could not go through with it in light of the prognosis of certain death <i>ex utero<\/i>, so the idea that we would ask people like them to FedEx their little baby back home to Ireland is inhumane.  For that reason, the recommendations in the report are critical to this debate.<\/p><p>The issue of rape and incest is one about which a lot of people speak.  Even people with quite conservative views in this area will say the issue of incest and rape should be addressed.  All the empirical legal evidence we have shows that it would be impossible for us to legislate on the ground of rape.  We have to trust the integrity and honesty of women.  Are we to put people who have been subjected to a vile act through another inquisition to find out and determine whether they have been raped in advance of having a termination?  If we are to have restrictions in this area, these are the things that will actually have to happen.  That is why, in the context of the recommendations of the committee, we also looked at the 12-week limit and decided that it should be a matter for the woman and her clinician to determine the reasons for a termination within that period.  That would also address the issue of incest and rape in the vast majority of cases in that we would not need to have an inquisition of women to establish whether they were telling the truth.  I firmly believe we should trust women in this context and that we have a duty to ensure they have the space, with their clinicians, to make the best decision for themselves and the lives they are living.<br\/><br\/>The Minister spoke about the age profile of those travelling abroad for a termination.  I have received several emails from people which, to say the least, I find quite alarming.  I am alarmed that there are people in our society who think this way because in their emails they are effectively saying the women who travel abroad are just using abortion as another form of contraception.  I find that grossly offensive.  I do not know of any woman who will get onto an aeroplane lightly and head to Liverpool, Birmingham or Holland for a termination of a pregnancy.  I know women who have had terminations, an issue with which they grappled before they made their final decision.  That it is just another form of contraception is a grotesque, offensive view of women.<br\/><br\/>As my party has allowed members a free vote, I am speaking in a personal capacity.  I am speaking as a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy but in a personal capacity and as a representative of the people of Cork North Central.  I leave my personal and political views outside the door when I speak about these issues because I have listened to the evidence given at the committee, heard the personal testimonies about what people had to endure and spoken to individual constituents who brought to my attention the challenges they faced when they received the devastating news of a fatal foetal abnormality or, in some cases, a foetal abnormality and the decisions they had to make.  Space should be given in this debate.  If we expect the people to behave in a manner that allows respect for varying views, the very least we should do is expect the same from each other in this House.  If we are to lead by example in any way, we must allow space for varying views to be expressed.<br\/><br\/>Committee members held varying views on the issues before it, but majority views were expressed in a number of areas.  The Citizens' Assembly made recommendations to allow a termination for various reasons, the first of which was a real and substantial physical risk to the life of the woman.  Reason No. 2 was a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman by suicide.  Reason No. 3 was a serious risk to the health of the woman.  Reason No. 4 was a serious risk to the mental health of the woman.  Reason No. 5 was a serious risk to the health of the woman.  Reason No. 6 was a risk to the physical health of the woman.  Reason No. 7 was a risk to the mental health of the woman.  Reason No. 8 was a risk to the health of the woman.  Reason No. 9 was pregnancy as a result of rape.  <br\/><br\/>As a committee, we concurred, by and large, with the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  However, we deviated from some of its recommendations, primarily in the area of disability.  We were very clear that disability should not be a ground for a termination.  Let us be honest - people make decisions and choices.  Are we to adjudicate on and be judgmental about the decisions they make?  Who are we to judge a person who has just received the most devastating news that the baby she is carrying has a profound disability or will die <i>ex-utero<\/i>?  The committee stated, however, that after a period of 12 weeks, disability would not be a ground for a legal termination.  That was the strongly held view of a lot of committee members, even those who had quite open views on this issue.  It was not the case that the committee was a slave to the Citizens' Assembly.  It deliberated on every one of the recommendations and came to its own conclusions and diverged in certain areas.  <br\/><br\/>I fervently hope the Government can keep to its timetable and that we can have the substantive issue of the repeal of Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>dealt with by the summer.  Publishing the scheme of a Bill in that timeframe will require a lot of resources.  We must be honest when we are talking about legislation, people having concerns about a 12-week limit, foetal anomalies, fatal foetal anomalies, incest and rape and so forth and point out that nothing can be done unless we remove Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>from the Constitution.  All the talk about what might or could happen is only relevant in the event that Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>is removed and the only ones who can remove it are the people.  My vote has the same value as that of any person outside the House.  It will be the citizens who will decide.  Our duty, first and foremost, is to facilitate the holding of a referendum and establish the commission to observe that it is fair and impartial.  Political parties and individuals must ensure, at the very least, that they are honest and upfront, whatever view they hold, and that we will all be respectful of each other.  As someone who will be 50 years old next Saturday, I do not want to preside over the continuation of the current situation, knowing that next year, the year after and the year after thousands of Irish girls and women will board aeroplanes to seek health care in other countries or climb the stairs to their bedroom with an abortion pill because the State has failed them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700039#SS00300","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516207200,"counter":442,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach seo at&aacute; roimh an D&aacute;il um thr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.  I am also grateful to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  I commend its members, including, in particular, its Chairman, Senator Catherine Noone, and the three Sinn F&eacute;in representatives, Deputies Louise O'Reilly and Jonathan O'Brien and Senator Paul Gavan.  I also thank the Citizens' Assembly and its chairman, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy.  I commend the Minister for Health for his very compassionate remarks.  I also commend the thoughtful remarks made by Teachta Billy Kelleher.<\/p>  <p>  One hundred years ago this year Countess Markievicz was elected to the first D&aacute;il.  She went on to become the first female Cabinet Minister in Europe.  She was part of a revolutionary strand of the national movement that included women such as Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, Kathleen Lynn and Elizabeth O'Farrell.  They were fine women who serve as role models for many of us to this day.  They led the struggle for women's rights in extraordinary times, buoyed by the freedom charter that was the 1916 Proclamation which addressed itself equally to Irish men and Irish women.  They must have felt betrayed after the counter revolutionary period which resulted in the development of two conservative, narrow-minded states that championed public policy that was anti-women, chauvinistic, cruel and intolerant.<\/p><p>Women were written out of history.  Their status in this State was confirmed in the 1937 Constitution,\u00a0which provided that the place of women is \"in the home\".  Women who strayed beyond the so-called norms were sent to\u00a0Magdalen laundries or mother and baby homes, where they endured unbelievable hardship and were denied everything\u00a0by a State that condemned them for no reason other than the fact that\u00a0they were women.  Such attitudes permeated every facet of Irish life.  The architecture of the State ensured women were consigned to\u00a0a lesser status.  The employment marriage bar remained in force until 1973.  Domestic violence was not recognised as an issue during this era.  It was not\u00a0until 1976 that a wife could seek a barring order against her husband.  Criminal conversation, which enshrined in law that a wife was the\u00a0property of her husband, remained on the Statute Book until 1981.  Contraception was not available without a prescription until 1985, and\u00a0even then only in chemists until 1991.  Simple things like the purchase of a television or a radio on\u00a0hire purchase were not possible without a husband's signature at this time.<\/p> <p> While strides have been made in addressing some of the historic\u00a0injustices forced on women by this State, the legacy of that treatment\u00a0remains with us in respect of issues like pay equality, or the lack of it.  It can be seen in the scarcity of women from many aspects of public life, politics and leadership positions in commerce, academia and other sectors.  This injustice is evident in the continued existence of the 1983 amendment to the Constitution, which was already out of touch at that time.  This amendment prohibits access to what is considered, and was considered even at that time, to be basic medical treatment in any\u00a0developed society.  That is not right.  It is wrong.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to end that\u00a0injustice.  The business of the State should be to ensure women have access\u00a0to proper health care services if they need them and choose to avail of them.  The State has a responsibility to support women.\u00a0 We should not fool ourselves.  Abortion is a reality in Ireland.  Abortion pills are available here.  They can be ordered online and\u00a0taken by women without medical supervision.  Women in distress can go to England, which is an English solution to an Irish problem.<\/p> <p> I have my own position on abortion.  As a legislator, I have no right\u00a0to impose that view on anyone.  It is not for any of us here to cast judgment on anybody for doing\u00a0what they feel they need to do.  It is for women to make that judgment.  I believe they are fully capable of doing so and are entitled to do so.  Those who are opposed to abortion are entitled to their opinions.  They are equally and fully entitled not to have terminations.  Everyone has the right to choose.  Those who subscribe to a particular faith can heed the\u00a0guidance of their religious leaders if they so choose.  My strongly held opinion is that it is not appropriate for anyone to foist their views on anyone else.  Some of those who will oppose that analysis are friends of mine.  They are good people whose sincerely held views I respect.  Tolerance has to be the hallmark of our discourse.<\/p> <p> Ireland has changed.  That change has been spearheaded by women in the first case.  Mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann are not going to accept as dogma the continued guidance, mar dhea, of a Constitution that was written\u00a0when they were second-class citizens and was\u00a0revised in 1983 under false pretences.  Women do not need moral diktats and certainly do not need condemnation.  They need and deserve respect.\u00a0 They need the right to make decisions about their own health\u00a0and their own lives.  Repealing the eighth amendment is the right thing to do.\u00a0 It will correct an historic wrong.  I hope a referendum to give the people the right to repeal the eighth amendment happens as soon as possible.  I hope the people will support that proposition.  Thereafter, we can debate the merits or otherwise of the legislation that will follow.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in accepts the need for abortion to be available\u00a0where a woman&rsquo;s life, health or mental health is at serious risk or in danger and in cases of rape or sexual abuse.  This has been our policy for a long time.  We recently dealt with the issue of fatal foetal abnormality at an Ard-Fheis.  I never knew there was such a condition.  We listened to compassionate people explaining how they or their partners, sisters or friends decided to carry a fatal foetal abnormality to full term while others could not do so.  We changed our position accordingly.  I think that is what we have to do.  The first step we need to take is to allow women the right to make a choice on these\u00a0deeply distressing matters.  It is their business, it is their right and it is their choice.  Sinn F&eacute;in will fully support the repeal of the eighth amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700040#TT00200","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516207800,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I would like to add my voice to those who have commended the work of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  I particularly commend my colleagues, Teachta&iacute; Louise O'Reilly and Jonathan O'Brien and Seanad&oacute;ir Paul Gavan.  I also commend the Chairman of the committee, Senator Catherine Noone, who did a very fine job.  As an Oireachtas, we made a big ask of our peers and colleagues on the committee.  I believe they conducted themselves with great dignity, compassion, intelligence and thoughtfulness throughout the hearings.  I commend them on that.  I was disappointed that some members of the committee tried unsuccessfully to thwart its work.  I do not say that to sound a note of rancour, but because it is important that the disrespectful commentary which featured in the course of the committee's work is not allowed to set the tone for the public debate.  As we move to repeal the eighth amendment of the Constitution and agree a new legislative and regulatory framework, I hope and believe it will be an historic and momentous journey for all of us.  I hope all of this work can be done in a respectful, well-informed, calm and fair atmosphere.<\/p>  <p>  The harrowing experiences of Joanne Hayes, and all the horrific events surrounding what became known as the Kerry babies scandal of more than 33 years ago, have played themselves out again in heartbreaking detail in the past 24 hours.  The scale of the abuse Joanne endured at the hands of the State was unprecedented and horribly and agonisingly public.  I welcome yesterday's apology from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and today's apology from the Taoiseach.  Such statements are most welcome.  The Taoiseach must now move to make good today's statement on compensation for Joanne Hayes.  She is entitled to a full and formal apology from the State for its persecution and vilification of her and her family.  She also deserves compensation and redress.  Back then, having failed Joanne and having pursued her case in the most corrupt manner, the Garda went viciously for a second bite at the tribunal of inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  I remember hearing Joanne Hayes's name when I was a girl.  I remember the Kerry babies being spoken of.  I also recall the incredible atmosphere of hostility directed at women and girls in 1983.  I can still feel the very toxic atmosphere in which the eighth amendment was conceived, debated and inserted into the Constitution.  I do not think there is a woman of my age in Ireland who cannot still feel how that atmosphere felt.  After all, this was the Ireland of the mother and baby homes and the Magdalen laundries.  It was an Ireland where women were to be subjugated and kept quiet inside the home to accept their fate.  This obsessive control of women did not happen by accident.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>It was very much intended by a powerful conservative cohort across society - in government and the churches, across the highest ranks of the public and Civil Service and among the professional elites.  Women's subjugation was part of a carving up of power and influence in the public and private spheres, which did not happen by accident.<br\/><br\/>The then journalist and current European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, wrote the following in 1992:<\/p><blockquote>The widespread passive acceptance of the patriarchal nature of Irish society also enabled the conservative lobby to hold sway.  Nothing threatens the system more than when women are enabled to take control of every aspect of their lives, public and private.  And there is nothing more critical to the exercise of that control than the ability to decide how many children to have, if any, and when to have them.<\/blockquote><p>The eighth amendment was in effect a constitutional coup and the reactionary codification of the suppression of women.  That is what happened in 1983.  In the decades since, women in Ireland have had to live with the abusive outworkings of the eighth amendment.  The X case, in particular, brought into sharp focus the worst expression of the conservative coup.  A child who was pregnant as a result of rape was dragged through the courts by the State, whose sole and stated intent was to force her to continue with the pregnancy from rape to full term.  I still struggle to fully comprehend the callousness of the State in so aggressively and cruelly forcing a child victim of rape to continue with pregnancy.  It is hard to fathom that any individual or agency could heap more abuse and trauma on a child who had already been violated.  Even after the Supreme Court judgment, the public outcry and the horrors endured by Miss X and her family, successive Governments refused for more than two decades to legislate for the X case.  It is important to record that this is a source of shame for successive Oireachtais.  It took the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar and the alphabetical array of cases taken by incredibly brave women to shame government into finally enacting in law the Supreme Court decisions in the X case.<br\/><br\/>There is now broad acceptance across the Oireachtas and in wider society that the eighth amendment must be repealed from the Constitution.  I passionately believe that now is the time for leadership and in that regard, I commend the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, on his words this evening.  Leadership must come from the front.<br\/><br\/>Abortion is a divisive issue.  That statement echoes throughout this debate.  While that may be the case, the abuse of women and indifference to our health and bodily integrity are not divisive issues but unacceptable positions to take in public life.  Some people argue that because abortion is a divisive issue, votes of conscience must, therefore, be allowed.  I do not share that view and I say this as someone who is deeply respectful of diverse views and fully understands that some people will struggle with this issue.  However, in the final analysis, this debate is a matter of public health, women's health, our right to decide and our right to respect for our conscience as we decide on matters for ourselves.  The clinicians and doctors, not least in the hearings of the joint committee, made clear that the eighth amendment casts a long shadow over their practice and relationships with their patients and jeopardises women's health and their lives.<br\/><br\/>The first issue for the Oireachtas to address is the nature of the question to be put for repeal.  A simple repeal of the eighth amendment of the Constitution, as recommended by the joint committee, must be delivered.  There can be no equivocation on this by anyone.  If legal advice that takes a contrary view is offered, for instance, if it is suggested that instead of repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>, an enabling clause should be inserted in the Constitution, the Government must share this advice with all Oireachtas Members because we need transparency and informed debate above all.<br\/><br\/>I agree with Deputy Billy Kelleher and my party colleague, Deputy Gerry Adams, that the first order of business is the repeal of the eighth amendment.  Thereafter, we must debate and acquire an understanding of the legislative framework.  The first task and duty of the Oireachtas at this time is to remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution.  It is time to right a fundamental wrong that occurred in 1983.  As legislators, we cannot accept the terrible impact of the eighth amendment on women's health, their obstetric care and well-being, and their and our fundamental rights.  We must state loud and clear that we trust and respect women and that there is no place for the cruelty of the eighth amendment in a modern and diverse Ireland.<br\/><br\/>There can be no place for unnecessary dogma or doctrinaire positions in the coming months.  I accept, however, that we must listen to, acknowledge and engage with people's concerns.  It is, after all, our shared responsibility to protect women's rights and health now and into the future by engaging in a respectful debate and delivering a successful referendum result, which means the repeal of the eighth amendment. <br\/><br\/>As we are all being confessional and owning up to our ages, I was 14 years old when the eighth amendment to the Constitution was made.  As I was reflecting on this debate and listening to Joanne Hayes, I wondered how I would explain to my 14 year old daughter what Ireland was like then and what the hostility experienced by women and girls felt like at the time.  I am very happy to say I could not begin to explain to my 14 year old daughter what that was like.  That is a great thing.  It is now time for the law, politics and every Member of the Oireachtas to catch up with public opinion and the new Ireland, the country in which my 14 year old daughter and all our daughters and granddaughters - and our boys and men - live and give us and them a decent, human rights-based and respectful Constitution that acknowledges women as full and equal people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700041#UU00200","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516208400,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I, too, am pleased to make a contribution to this important and perhaps historic debate.  I do so as leader of the Labour Party and the first speaker in this debate who was a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1983.  At that time, I was a newly appointed Member of the other House and I was present in the Seanad on Wednesday, 4 May 1983 when the then Senator Mary Robinson moved an amendment on behalf of the Labour Party group.  The amendment stated that Seanad &Eacute;ireann refused to give a Second Reading to the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution Bill on the grounds that the legislation was so unclear and ambiguous that it was not a proper subject for a proposal to be submitted to the people in a referendum.<\/p><p>That was the unanimous view of Labour Party Senators, of which I was one.  The Taoiseach at the time, Garret FitzGerald, described the constitutional amendment Bill as dangerous and unacceptable.  At the same time, he urged Fine Gael Senators to abstain on the Labour Party amendment.  The amendment to refuse the passage of the eighth amendment Bill in Seanad &Eacute;ireann was lost by 18 votes to 15, with Fine Gael Senators abstaining and all Fianna F&aacute;il Senators opposing the Labour Party amendment.  At the time there were three Northern Irish Members of the Seanad, all of whom supported the Labour Party position.<\/p> <p> I believed then, as I do now, that the Constitution is not the place to determine our laws on abortion.  Others have said that Ireland has changed radically in the past 35 years, and so it has.  The issue of abortion, throughout this period, has been divisive and challenging.  Unlike any other issue of social policy, it has not been those most directly affected who have been involved in the debate - it has not been the women.  We have heard how at least 170,000 women since 1980 have availed of abortion services outside the State.  For the most part, they have been silent and unseen.  Their voices and experiences have gone largely unheard.  Often, they have been unable to discuss their choices or health needs with friends, relatives or even medical practitioners.  Instead, by and large, the debate 35 years ago and since has been led by individuals and groups who come to the issue with moral certainty and crusading zeal.  In that context, I commend the work undertaken with care and openness by the Citizens' Assembly and the all-party Oireachtas committee.  In particular, I commend the work of the chairperson of the committee, Senator Catherine Noone.<\/p> <p> The report of the committee is clear and thorough.  The committee addressed two fundamental issues.  First, it examined the requirement or otherwise for constitutional reform.  The eighth amendment of the Constitution was passed on 7 September 1983 after what the report characterised as a bitterly contested referendum.  I believe that characterisation is accurate, indeed understated.  I remember it.  I was going to include some of my memories of that time but I decided that would only contribute to further divisiveness.  Anyway, the experience of that campaign impacted on all political discussion of the issue subsequently.  I welcome the change in atmosphere thus far, although judging from some e-mails and letters already received, I doubt if that will continue.<\/p> <p> The recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly was to replace Article 40.3.3o with a provision that explicitly authorises the Oireachtas to legislate to address termination of pregnancy, any rights of the unborn and any rights of pregnant women.  I strongly agree with the view taken by the Oireachtas committee regarding the effect this proposal would have on the separation of powers.  The recommended approach of the committee, that is, to simply repeal Article 40.3.3o is, I believe, a better and safer course of action.<\/p> <p> The first and fundamental issue is that the Constitution is not the appropriate place to deal with an issue as complicated as abortion, impacting as it does on evolving medical practice and technology.  I believe this view is widely supported.  In many ways, therefore, it is not what will replace Article 40.3.3o by way of legislative provision in the event that the Oireachtas was free to legislate in this matter that has been the greater focus of the Oireachtas committee.  The first issue must be to allow the Oireachtas to make those decisions and to remove Article 40.3.3o from the Constitution.<\/p> <p> Whatever proposals we determine &ndash; I intend to deal with them in some detail &ndash; will evolve over time in any event.  Many have argued prior to 1983 and since that a constitutional provision is required because neither the Oireachtas nor the Judiciary can be trusted on this issue.  The original objective was to tie the hands of elected Deputies and Senators to prevent change in our abortion laws, regardless of changes in medical practice, knowledge or understanding as well as changes in drugs and general access to drugs.<\/p> <p> The constitutional provision of 35 years ago remains unaltered.  Given all the experience of the past three decades, it is surely now time for change.  The Oireachtas must be given scope to address these critical issues in an evolving world.  The members of the Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas Committee showed how these matters can be addressed calmly and thoroughly having regard to the complexity surrounding abortion and maternal health.  They provided proof, if proof were needed, that the Oireachtas can be trusted and, equally important, should be trusted to act in the best interests of all the people.<\/p> <p> The legislation that should be enacted in the event of Article 40.3.3o being deleted from the Constitution was a significant focus of the committee.  A total of 13 recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly relating to the grounds on which termination of pregnancy might be lawful were considered in turn.  The committee also examined the operation of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  In general terms, I believe it is fair to say that the Oireachtas committee did not recommend change as far-reaching as that recommended by the Citizens' Assembly, a point made by Deputy Kelleher.  Clearly, the Citizens' Assembly recommendation that abortion should be lawful up to 22 weeks' gestation on socioeconomic grounds was not supported by the Oireachtas committee.  Instead, the committee recommended that the law should be amended to permit termination of pregnancy with no restriction as to the reason, provided that it is availed of through a GP-led service delivered in a clinical context as determined by law and licensing practice in Ireland with a gestational limit of 12 weeks.  Although this recommendation is, as I said, far more restrictive than that proposed by the Citizens' Assembly, it is still likely to be the most controversial of the committee recommendations.  For that reason, I believe it deserves most careful consideration and an examination of the reasoning that brought the majority of the committee members to this conclusion.<\/p> <p> In truth, to fully understand the development of thought it is necessary to have listened to or read the submissions and presentations to the committee.  The report condenses this important and vital work into a few short paragraphs, but it is clear from the work of the committee that, in the context of any move from general declarations of principle to actual practical law, the committee recommendation makes sense.  How can we achieve the objective to allow for abortion in the case of rape or incest in any other way?  It cannot be that we need a police investigation and court prosecution to have concluded before determining that an abortion can be lawful.<\/p><p>God protect us from going down that route again.  To attempt to legislate for rape or incest on a stand-alone basis would open a nightmare world for already traumatised women.  It would involve garda&iacute; and lawyers when what is needed is medical and psychological support.  The reopening of the appalling circumstances surrounding the Kerry babies case should be evidence enough of that.  Our laws have to be practical, enforceable and humane.  The committee&rsquo;s recommendation in this regard is, therefore, I believe, the correct one.  That view is immeasurably strengthened by the fact of life of the broad availability today of abortion pills.  Unless it is our intention to arrest and prosecute every woman who imports or takes such pills, we need to face up to that reality.  While there may be some who would advocate such arrests and prosecutions, I have no doubt that such action would be repudiated by the majority of our people, not to mention the implication for women&rsquo;s rights in international law.  When the matter is carefully examined, it is clear how and why the committee came to make this recommendation.<\/p> <p> Another area where the Oireachtas committee differed with the Citizens' Assembly was in the assembly's recommendation allowing for abortion up to 22 weeks' gestation in the case of foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth.  The committee&rsquo;s view, with which I agree, was not to accept this recommendation.  The committee recommended that provisions in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 needed to be amended.  That Act was drafted under the constraints of Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.  Many of us, including Members such as myself who were in government when the Act was enacted, will be very happy to see the Act amended in the event of constitutional change allowing us to do that.<\/p> <p> There is much more in the report dealing with sex education, obstetric care and counselling, and contraception.  It is a very important and welcome body of work.  It is now time for the rest of us in the Oireachtas, those who were not members of the committee, to do our bit.  We need to address, without delay, the steps to be taken to allow the people to have their say before the end of May.  Talk of slipping into June is not acceptable and we have already received large volumes of correspondence from young people who will be out of the country in June, having finished their studies.  Students start their leaving certificate on 6 June and it would be perverse if the very people who will be most affected are excluded from having their say, for the first time, on this truly important issue.<\/p> <p> We need to address the steps to be taken to allow this to happen before the end of May.  The T&aacute;naiste today set out the path before us.  The Minister for Health is to bring memoranda before Cabinet between now and March.  We need to pass the referendum Bill.  We need to establish a referendum commission and allow it adequate time to do its important work.  Equally important, in my opinion, is to ensure that all of this is done in time for a May referendum.  Members have commented favourably on the Minister's speech on this issue and I thought it was a very thoughtful speech.  However, it was a speech that said we needed to bring about change, not a speech that said, \"I am the Minister and this is what I intend to do.  Having considered the report, this is what I am going to recommend to colleagues.\"  We need to get to this point.  We have had decades of debate and there has been concentrated debate in the Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas committee in the past year.  It is now time to set out the timelines for achieving this objective and to allow the people to have their say.<\/p> <p> I began by reflecting on the debates in these Chambers in 1983.  Seared by the campaign that followed, I express the hope that we can do things differently and more respectfully now.  In the intervening years, as Minister for Health I had my office and home picketed.  Children&rsquo;s coffins were brought to my Wexford office and things that I will not mention were posted in my home town.  I hope that the past is another country and that it is possible for all of us to listen as well as speak and to acknowledge difference without vile attack.  For my party, that is what I pledge.  The Labour Party accepts the Oireachtas committee report and its recommendations.  We will campaign for change with vigour but with respect.<\/p> <p> My party has been at the forefront of social change for as long as I can remember, in campaigns that look amazing in retrospect such as to provide for legal contraception, to allow for divorce and, most recently, to provide for marriage equality.  All, in their time, were strongly resisted.  All, in their time, came to pass.  Often we discover that the people&rsquo;s thinking on social policy is more advanced than that of the elected Members of these Houses.  Let the people decide this matter.  Let us also work to ensure that they can do so in an atmosphere of reason and without interference from groups or elements outside our State.  No doubt many groups will engage in this campaign and some will seek to characterise it as something which it is not.  What is in question here is an important matter of social policy for our people, not the contest of State and church or the defeat of anyone.  Simply and importantly, it is a matter of supreme importance to thousands of our citizens, as families and individual women try to make the best possible decision for themselves and their loved ones.  After decades of fear, the people in 2015 overwhelmingly passed a constitutional amendment to allow same-sex marriage.  For many who voted yes, that was a journey of self-discovery and tolerance.  Perhaps it is not too much to hope for something similar on this issue too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700042#VV00200","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516209600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  I welcome the people who are in the Gallery for the debate but there are hundreds of people outside, members of the Strike 4 Repeal movement, in freezing cold temperatures, listening to the debate.  Young people in this country are watching this issue like no other political issue and it will be the biggest political and social issue in 2018 and for many years to come.  The people outside are waiting to hear the response of the D&aacute;il to the all-party committee report and the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, and an action plan from Government outlining what will happen and when it will be implemented.<\/p>  <p>  The nub of the issue is that people want a simple repeal referendum by late May because that is the optimal time for the maximum participation of young people.  Lest anybody be under any illusion, young people are the people most affected by this decision.  This D&aacute;il is not made up of young people but of a very unrepresentative sample of society in many ways.  They want a referendum that will lead to change and real abortion legislation.<\/p><p>At the very minimum, that legislation must provide for unrestricted access to abortion up to 12 weeks.  If anybody thinks that repeal can be avoided or that we can put it off until the autumn or until next year, if that was even contemplated, there would be a revolt among young people.  If anyone thinks we can have a repeal referendum with very little change following it, that would also lead to a huge reaction.  The tide cannot be held back on this issue any longer.<\/p> <p> I have spoken on the issue of abortion a lot.  I am tired of listening to myself, never mind what other people are tired of listening to.  This is for a reason.  It is because the idea of bodily autonomy is an absolute for young people.  Abortion rights are what people want - not on this or that ground, not a \"deserving\" abortion.  The concept of abortion rights is what most young people and a growing section of the population now believe in.  Political parties cannot just hide behind repeal and think they can sail through the referendum without saying what will follow it.  They cannot try to pretend they stand for things that they may not stand for.  They can cut that out as well because-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700044#XX00200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516210200,"counter":451,"content":"<p>We are not doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700045#YY00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1516210200,"counter":452,"content":"<p>We are not doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700045#YY00300","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1516210200,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I am talking to the whole D&aacute;il.  In effect, this will be a referendum on abortion rights.  In a sense, that is only natural.  I do not think that this D&aacute;il has the guts or the composition to bring in abortion legislation without a massive public endorsement and a push to do so.  The concept of 12 weeks will be key in the referendum.<\/p><p>Solidarity-PBP is obviously pro-choice.  It was the only fully pro-choice formation in the D&aacute;il up until recent times.  Hopefully, that will change.  We have played a lead role in arguing this case and in the active movement for repeal.  Solidarity-PBP recognises that these are historic recommendations.  It is only four short years since the very same parties, arguing for change, voted in a 14-year jail sentence for women.  That is a fact.  What has brought this change about?  We have heard many on the committee and others saying they were on a journey.  The phrase has become very well worn and they have decontextualised it from the actual reality.  People may have been on a journey but they were pushed to go on it, in many cases kicking and screaming.  Change has been forced from outside.  The evidence that was heard at the committee was very important.  I played a role in arguing and advancing some of that evidence, very importantly in the case of the abortion pills, which are a crucial factor in the decision that has been reached and which have been cited by many people.  The civil disobedience that was undertaken with regard to the abortion pills was also hugely important.  The use of the abortion pill tripled in about three years, since particular actions were taken by organisations like ROSA and others.  We need to be honest about where the change has come from.<\/p><p>We also need to be honest that this D&aacute;il set up the Citizens' Assembly in an outsourcing fashion and assumed it would come back with a much more minimal recommendation.  There is always a danger when we entrust ordinary people with important decisions.  They might actually listen, engage and fact-check the evidence they hear.  They might come up with essentially compassionate and pro-choice recommendations.  The recommendation of 12 weeks on request came from the Citizens' Assembly.  I also want to put on record that socioeconomic reasons up to 22 weeks unfortunately was not agreed by a majority of parties and groups but it was advanced by a strong minority.  It was a bit of a cop-out, to be honest.  Many women will not be able to fall in to a 12-week timeframe for many reasons and usually they will be the most vulnerable, the poorest and the youngest.  All we are doing is continuing travel outside the State.<\/p><p>The other question I want to address is disability and severe abnormality.  It is quite clear that people who are anti-abortion are going to use very emotive arguments about disability, Down's Syndrome, etc.  We have heard them already throughout this campaign.  It is the case that the committee did not take a majority position of support in respect of severe abnormality.  I take no moral lectures from anybody about a woman who would make a decision on those grounds.  It is not a cake-walk bringing up a child with a severe disability.  I refer particularly to parties and individuals who have done nothing to make their lives better and who have voted for cuts in disability services, etc.<\/p><p>The response of a huge number of Deputies has so far been to run for cover.  A huge number have still not declared where they stand on this.  If examining one's conscience was an Olympic sport, numbers of Irish Deputies would be winning gold medals.  There was a great play made around the time of the marriage equality referendum that everyone held hands in the D&aacute;il and walked out and won the referendum.  That was not the case and it will not be the case here because parties will not be united.  There is not a party whip.  The winning of the referendum will be down to huge numbers of active people, young people, women and communities.<\/p><p>For politicians who are feeling troubled, it is very simple.  The two questions they need to ask and answer are these: first, whether they support abortion being legal or illegal, because it will continue regardless and, second, whether they actually support forcing people to remain pregnant who do not want to be pregnant.  That is the logic of supporting a ban on abortion.  People say there are extreme views on both sides.  I do not think I have an extreme view.  My view is that the person involved ultimately should make the decision.  I think that is a humane view.<\/p><p>We need to give huge credit to the active campaigns like those from the people who are outside the House this evening.  The protests have mushroomed in the last years, with the repeal jumpers being worn, people taking part in repeal protests and the strike for repeal.  Women have themselves defied the unjust ban by ordering abortion pills online and we have seen events like the abortion pill train, bus, etc. that I mentioned.  The recommendations of the committee arise from those social movements that have taken place on the ground.<\/p><p>Many people have invoked 1983 and 1984, the year that followed the eighth amendment, the crass hypocrisy around Ann Lovett, the Kerry babies, etc.  There is now a growing movement for gender equality.  We have seen it with Trump and with the #metoo movement.  The movement taking place outside on repeal is the exact same.  It is a movement for bodily autonomy and for abortion rights.  The time is up now for politicians to be hiding on this issue.  There is no hiding place left.  Young people will not accept any further procrastination or restrictions.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to state the date of the referendum.  It has not been set.  That is a key demand and question in the minds of people outside.  The information we got from the T&aacute;naiste earlier that the Government is not going to move a repeal Bill until early March is leaving it extremely tight.  We need at least six weeks plus 30 days' grace before the referendum can be called.  Maybe the Minister would clarify that.  To be clear, it has to be repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>.  This was debated by the committee.  I do not have time to go into it.

Only that I am a Deputy and the garda&iacute; recognised me, I would not have been able to move.  Why is there such paranoia about this subject and women?  Why is society so terrified to allow women to have a voice on an issue that has everything to do with their bodies?  The vast majority of people out there are ordinary young women.<\/p><p>They were not going to storm the gates of Leinster House and come in with submachine guns to mow us all down.  They are out there to plead with us for God's sake to get on with it. <\/p> <p> This D&aacute;il has a shameful history of dealing with this issue.  I saw that with my own eyes long before I came in here.  It used to crease me to see that for 21 years after the Supreme Court ruled on the X case, there was cowardice played out in this House.  No party had the guts to move on this issue until Deputy Clare Daly brought in the first Bill in, I understand, April 2012.  That was the first time anybody had the guts to say this was an issue and we have to confront it.<\/p> <p> There was a campaign in 1983 for the eighth amendment, and I am acutely aware of Joanne Hayes, the Kerry babies and all of the statistics.  I am also acutely aware that anybody under the age of 45 years, not just Deputy McDonald's daughter, is horrified today having read the details of what happened to Joanne Hayes all those years ago.  We are not just talking about the darkness of the 1980s.<\/p> <p> In 2017, a young woman was sectioned under the Mental Health Act because she said she was suicidal and wanted to have an abortion.  In 2014, we kept a clinically dead woman alive for several weeks against the wishes of her family because the foetus inside her had a heartbeat.  In 2014, a raped asylum seeker was forced against her will to continue with a pregnancy.  In 2012, Savita Halappanavar died, having requested an abortion in a hospital in Galway.  We have the alphabet soup of Miss X, Miss C and Miss D.  I could go on and on.  We have the condemnation by the UN Human Rights Commission that what happened to Amanda Mellet was inhumane, degrading and cruel.  What does that say about this country and the political representatives who have run it for the past decades?  It says a lot and we are indeed living in the dark ages.  We do not have to think about the Kerry babies.<\/p> <p> I know there are genuine people who do not want to see this happen again and are ashamed of that shameful dark history.  They are worried when they hear that the floodgates will open and that women will want to have abortions every other day of the week because it is a great way not to get pregnant or that women will get pregnant just to get rid of it and will get pills and swallow them.  If people do not want to see any of these incidents repeated, they need to vote to repeal the eighth amendment.  The obstetricians and gynaecologists who came to the committee gave evidence that the eighth amendment creates a chill factor for the medical profession when it comes to dealing with women.  They are afraid of their lives to intervene when there is a heartbeat because of the eighth amendment.<\/p> <p> To those who are middle of the road, I ask them to vote to get rid of the amendment.  Until they do, we will have a repetition of the X, Y and C cases, Amanda Mellet and others.  That has to be stated clearly.  The vast majority of people in this country do not wish to see that sort of the society, even though there is an extreme atmosphere around this issue, in particular in the corridors of religion and sometimes in the corridors of power.<\/p> <p> I wish to speak to those who want to stop women having bodily autonomy.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, made a very good speech.  It was very conciliatory but there were some gaping holes in it because he referred to the 1861 Act, which subjected women to penal servitude for life.  I understand a life sentence is about seven years.  We have an Act which subjects women to a 14 year sentence, but the he forgot to mention it.  He also said that he wanted to give out as much information as possible during the course of the referendum.  Can we please ensure that all Deputies have a sense of responsibility?  If they give out information, they should make sure it is accurate so that we are not told by a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy that the floodgates will open for abortion on the grounds of Down's syndrome.  One cannot get a test for Down's syndrome prior to 12 weeks' gestation without paying &euro;400.<\/p> <p> Deputy Coppinger referred to socio-economics.  A woman could always have an abortion in this country if she could afford it, by getting on a plane, going away and paying for it.  When a woman is poor, an asylum seeker, living direct provision or a worker who cannot take time off and has to scrape pennies together to pay up to &euro;2,000 for an abortion, that is when she is discriminated against.  That is one good reason to remove discrimination on the basis of class and discrimination against a cohort of women who do not have the right to enter and leave this country freely.<\/p> <p> We also have to have respect for doctors and the medical profession and give them the space to work with women to make decisions about their health.  It is the only time in the maternity care system when an individual does not have the right to say what happens to her body.  I know many women who go through miscarriages are forced to wait for 20 or 25 hours because a doctor is not allowed to induce them.  They have to wait in terrible pain until the miscarriage is seen through to the end.  That has left many women I know of, who are my age, distressed for their entire lives and has had an impact on their families.<\/p> <p> I wish to make a strong appeal to those who think that protecting the eighth amendment means they are protecting something precious.  They are not.  All they are protecting is the dark history of this country.  They are not going to protect any unborn foetus or potential child by protecting the eighth amendment.  We cannot force women to be pregnant when they do not want to be.  They will find a way out of it.  As has already been said, it is a case of supporting legal abortion or supporting illegal abortion, or supporting the extradition and enforced exile of women from this country to Liverpool, London, Holland and elsewhere.  It is forcing young women, in particular, to have abortions on their own, in their own beds, by taking the pill without any medical supervision, and because of the chill factor of the 14 year sentence, they are afraid to tell their parents.<\/p> <p> In Northern Ireland three women have been arrested and charged for using or procuring the abortion pill.  One was a mother who procured it for her child and the other two women procured it for themselves.  That also has to change.  I hope that if we get the eighth amendment out of the Constitution and begin to establish legal safe abortion for women in this country, it will cross the Border and the Brexit factor will not stop it from happening.  It should have had it long before us under the 1968 Abortion Act in Britain.<\/p> <p> I want to say to those who think they are protecting precious life to think about it in this way.  There are children living in this country who have been born in this country.  One fifth of them live in poverty.  Approximately 3,000 are in homeless accommodation today.  Molly, who we heard about during the week, is an example of one of the hundreds of children who have not had their rights met.  They are born, they are human flesh and they are living.  We have not endorsed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We continue to force children into homeless accommodation.  If people feel so passionately about life, join us in fighting to change that, get the rights of people with disabilities acknowledged and end homelessness and poverty among lone parents, which is at the highest ever rate.<\/p> <p> There are many ways to skin a cat and protect human life.  That is what I would like to say to those who think I am some kind of terrorist.  I am sure many others have received the literature which called us terrorists for supporting a woman's right to choose.  The right to choose, by the way, is to be able to choose to have a child as well.  How can a woman choose to have a child with dignity and respect if she has no home, proper health service or job, or no access to IVF treatment when she is finding it difficult to get pregnant?  Choice work both ways.  Women should be able to choose to control pregnancies and have a child.  That is the sort of future society we want to live in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700045#YY00700","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516210800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  I thank Senator Catherine Noone and all of the members of the committee and the Citizens' Assembly.  I also thank the Minister for his speech, its content and the way he delivered it.  However, I have two reservations which have already been mentioned.  One is that he gave no timeline and the second is the failure to mention the draconian 2013 legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the various recommendations of the committee.  The Constitution was amended in the 1980s.  The 1980s gave us the case of Sheila Hodgers who died on 19 March, prior to the referendum.  We knew exactly what we were doing in the country when we passed the referendum.<\/p><p>She died two days after delivering her baby prematurely.  Her cancer treatment had been stopped by the hospital which claimed it would harm her pregnancy.  She was also denied X-rays and pain relief.  That was prior to the amendment.  When we passed the amendment it was a time in Ireland when we had the Kerry babies tribunal and when Ann Lovett died, 33 years ago at the end of this month, on 31 January.  It was an Ireland that sent Eileen Flynn from her position in a school in Wexford simply because she loved a man whom she subsequently married, with whom she had a child and whose children she raised.  It was the 1980s of the moving statues, limited contraceptives and when marital rape was not recognised.  It was a time when we had no divorce and many other things were absent.<\/p> <p> As somebody who lived through that time as a young woman it was the Ireland of secrets, shame and mass emigration.  It was an Ireland that told us that if we stepped out of line and did something we would be punished severely one way or another.  Those secrets and that shame came to light and they were overseen by the pillars of society at the time both in the church and outside it.  Subsequently, we saw those pillars fall to the ground.  I am not here to mention names but one has to mention some names such as those of Fr. Cleary and Bishop Casey, and the subsequent exposure of horrific abuse.  We had different types of inquiry, for example, into clerical abuse in Ferns, Cloyne and Dublin.  Institutional abuse was examined in the Ryan report.  The abuse in families was exposed by numerous inquiries such as those in Kilkenny and Roscommon.  The report into the abuse in the Kilkenny incest case was subsequently published in the 1990s.  We had the 1980s of secrets, which followed on from previous decades of secrets, and that has continued as previous speakers said right up to today as we grapple with the mother and baby home in Tuam.  We still have not learnt to be honest, straight and direct.  I am pleased the Minister is nodding his head in relation to that.<\/p> <p> I have thanked the Minister and the committee but I wish in particular to thank the courageous women who have brought the inadequacy of the eighth amendment to our attention repeatedly in the most appalling of circumstances.  I refer, for example, to the 17-year old who refused to allow herself to be classified as suicidal ten years ago, back in 2007.  She was being pushed to say she was suicidal when she simply wanted a termination because she had discovered that she had an anencephalic pregnancy.  She was adamant that she was not suicidal and she was forced to go to the High Court.  Many cases have arisen since the introduction of the eighth amendment which I do not have time to go into.  It was quite clear at the time to me and to other people that it was an appalling amendment to the Constitution.  Even as young women we knew there were going to be problems.<\/p> <p> In 1992 there was the case which famously became known as the X case.  It involved a 14-year old girl who was raped by a family friend.  She had to go through absolute torture to get a termination.  In 1997 a 13-year old girl was raped and became pregnant.  Again, the circumstances were appalling and there was an appalling process involved for her to try to get a termination.  The D case took place in 2006.  A fatal foetal abnormality was diagnosed and again it was a difficult process to get a termination.  I mentioned the 17-year old Miss D case in 2007.  In 2010 there was the A, B and C cases.  Miss C was pregnant and suffering from cancer.  In 2012 in my own city we had Savita's case.  Again, there was an absolutely appalling lack of basic treatment but the fact is that more emphasis was put on a foetal heartbeat than on the treatment of obvious sepsis and that should not have happened.  In 2016 there was the Amanda Mellet case and in 2017 there was the Whelan case.  Over that period we have been forced to confront this issue by very brave women whose health has suffered, some of whom have died.  We have also been forced to do so by European court judgments, and a United Nations committee which has clearly told us that what we are doing to our women is inhuman, degrading and amounts to certain torture.<\/p> <p> I am here tonight to proudly add my voice to say the amendment simply has to go.  It is time to trust women to make decisions.  I make my comments in the context of the centenary celebration of women getting the right to vote, albeit a limited right, and 70 years after No&euml;l Browne bravely tried to introduce his comprehensive mother and child scheme.  That was not successful.  Seventy years later we have a very welcome report from the Oireachtas committee with its ancillary recommendations telling us that in the 21st century, in 2018, we have significant gaps in the provision of maternity services.  The Minister clarified that this is the first maternal strategy.  We are excluding women from the health service in the 21st century, 70 years after Noel Browne's gallant attempt.  Women are excluded from the health service in terms of getting a termination and they are going abroad in their thousands.  The figure of 3,265 was mentioned.  Those women come back bleeding, having travelled through airports, and we stand over that and exclude them from any follow-up treatment.  We should cringe, collectively, that it has taken us this much time and effort from vulnerable women who have had the courage in the most appalling circumstances to stand up, and also our colleagues such as Deputies Clare Daly, Br&iacute;d Smith and Mick Wallace, and all the other people who have tried to raise the issue.  If I mention names I might forget somebody so I pay tribute to all the Deputies who have brought or attempted to bring Bills before the D&aacute;il to deal with the matter in a humane way.  It is time to treat this society as a secular society.  Ironically, for those who are totally against abortion, whose opinion I fully respect, the best way to reduce the rate of abortion is to look at those countries which have liberal regimes as they have a very low rate of abortion.  For me, that is the most ironic fact in all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700046#ZZ00200","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516211400,"counter":460,"content":"<p>First, I acknowledge the hard work and informed research carried out by the members and the Chair of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution over the course of four arduous months.  It could not have been easy and the burden was huge but we are grateful that the committee members have done the groundwork to enable a constructive, respectful debate on the issue of abortion in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The outcome of the Citizens' Assembly and committee prove that once armed with informed research and information and personal accounts of people's experiences, the compassionate support for the right of women to access abortion reveals itself overwhelmingly.  I also believe that people are ready to engage on this issue and I am hopeful that the majority of the public will support a repeal.<\/p>  <p>  There is a narrative in the media that this committee report is extreme in its liberalisation of abortion provision in this country.  While I am supportive of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations, I believe they do not go far enough and I am disappointed that unrestricted abortion provision only goes to 12 weeks.  Legislation should provide for access to abortion after 12 weeks on broader grounds.  My reason for this is that once we start introducing restrictions, inevitably someone will fall through the cracks and term limits inevitably become political and moral barriers which end up affecting the most vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  We need to acknowledge that every situation is unique and that we should support women no matter what choice they make about their bodies.  For me, it is a fundamental human right for someone to enjoy bodily autonomy but right now in this country only men can enjoy that right.<\/p>  <p>  I remind the House that the effects of the eighth amendment are all pervasive.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The amendment restricts women on a number of fronts, including in regard to access to sexual health information owing to the Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 and the issue of consent throughout the provision of maternity care, not to mention the fact that the amendment has accounted for one of the strictest abortion regimes in the world.<\/p> <p> The committee is strong in emphasising that all women should have equal access to improved health care services, including basic services such as scanning and testing, and that these should be made available irrespective of geographic location or socioeconomic circumstances.  All these services help to inform women to make the best choice for them, and this can be only a positive step for society.  It will, however, be a resources issue.  I encourage the Government to devise a national strategy that would see improved access to reproductive services for all women and girls, including better sexual health and relationship education, family planning services, contraception - including free contraception for medical card holders - perinatal hospice care, counselling and support services, and termination of pregnancy, if required.  All are vital in every part of this country.<\/p> <p> Not only have we denied women the right to health care in this country but we have also denied the existence of abortion.  Abortion is a fact of life, and it will be always a fact of life.  We have only to look at the statistics.  Between January 1980 and December 2016, at least 170,000 women and girls travelled from the Republic of Ireland to access abortion services in another country.  In 2016, 3,265 women and girls gave Irish addresses at UK abortion services.  A 2016 report shows that 1,642 abortion pill packages were sent to Ireland in the three-year period between 2010 and 2012, and that was just by a single provider.  These are the facts.  We all know of people who supported women to get on planes to avail of services that should have been available in this country.<\/p> <p> An interesting fact, which struck a chord with me, was that 70% of Irish women who seek an abortion in the UK are in a relationship while over half of them already have children.  This statistic is from the advocacy group One Day More in the UK.  We have to accept that life is complex and we need to face that complexity by supporting people making difficult life choices.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the committee's comment that the State should provide specific resources so that there would be social supports for carers and better facilities for people whose children have specific needs.  People with disabilities should be supported so they can lead a life of dignity and respect.  It is not a fair argument to equate abortion provision and disability-selective abortions because, again, each case is unique.  I, for one, support women irrespective of the choice they make.  Women's bodies should not be used to address the stigma around disability; rather, it is the job of the Government to make sure that society treats all its people equally regardless of disability.  A separate debate on this is much needed but it does not belong here.  One should not forget that people with disabilities are also affected by the eighth amendment, which restricts their rights to bodily autonomy and family planning.<\/p> <p> Ultimately, the constitutional provision makes no legal sense and was inserted as a political weapon at the time of the referendum.  For 34 years, the eighth amendment has been inherently ambiguous in its meaning and scope and the courts have not been able to fully clarify its content.<\/p> <p> I want to end with a quote from the National Women's Council of Ireland which states, \"...the person who can best protect and nurture a developing life is of course the pregnant woman herself.  Not lawyers.  Not judges.  Certainly not the Constitution.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700047#AAA00200","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516212000,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister on his speech.  I commend the work of the committee and the Citizens' Assembly.  I was critical of the Government's decision to delegate these deliberations to the Citizens' Assembly.  While I believe that any Government worth its salt should have taken responsibility itself for ending Ireland's cruel and degrading treatment of women, I respect the work done and sacrifices made by the members of the Citizens' Assembly and the committee.<\/p>  <p>  It is important for us to understand how the committee arrived at its recommendations.  By this, I mean that if Members of the House or members of the public have a conscientious objection to, or are wary of, the recommendations, I urge them to try to understand the building blocks and logic of the committee's deliberations.  In this respect, I first want to address the issues of a threat to the life of the mother and a threat to the health of a mother.<\/p>  <p>  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act permits abortion only where there is a risk to the life of a pregnant woman.  While I fundamentally opposed the introduction of this incredibly restrictive Act, and still do, I believe most people would agree, even if they described themselves as pro-life, that where there is a threat to the life of a mother, access to abortion should be permitted.  It would be perverse to think otherwise.  While I have been always in favour of access to abortion when there was a threat to the health of the woman, there are those who see the life of the foetus as being more important than the health of the woman.  Obviously, I do not agree with this view, but there are others who do.  As I said, however, we need to understand how the committee arrived at its recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  Fundamental and crucial to the decision of the committee is the timing of critical clinical decision-making in saving a woman's life.  Maternity medical professionals say it is dangerous and unworkable to leave or ignore a threat to a woman's health until a clear threat to her life is identified.  That transition between a threat to the health of the woman and a threat to her life can, and does, happen extremely quickly and it can quickly become too late.  Medical practice requires flexibility, which the current law does not permit.  Doctors cannot adequately measure or grade risk.  Medical risk, especially medical risk during pregnancy, is just too unpredictable.  It is also too personal to be divided into low or high risk.  I am referring here to the doctors' definition of risk but also, of course, to the woman's definition of risk or, indeed, to a father's or partner's definition of risk.<\/p>  <p>  Some women may have a high tolerance for risk and may be even willing to let that risk shift - it can shift very rapidly until it is too late - from a risk to her health to a risk to her life.  That, of course, would be her decision and she would be free to make it, but no woman should be forced to put her life at risk.  We should not define risk in the Constitution or legislation.  Surely that is self-evident.  Medical risk should be considered in a clinical setting, in real time, by medical specialists.<\/p>  <p>  The crucial building block in the committee arriving specifically at its \"12 weeks and without reason\" decision was the issue of pregnancy as a result of rape or other sexual assault.  Opinion polls indicate that the majority of Irish people do not think it is humane to force a woman to carry to term a pregnancy that is the result of rape or incest.  Irish people are not that cruel.  While people may accept this, they may have issues with the 12-week period and the recommendation that no reason for a termination should be specified.  I urge people to remain open-minded in terms of understanding the logic of this recommendation.  The expert legal advice given at the committee established what is essentially the impossibility of legislating for rape.  This impossibility relates to the burden of proof that would be required in such cases.  The precedent of an adjudication process has been already established by the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and would see a raped woman questioned, put on trial and forced to relive the worst experiences of her life.<\/p>  <p>  It is an accepted fact that rape is considerably under-reported.  Rape victims have incredible difficulty reporting rape to anyone, never mind the Garda or an adjudication panel wishing to determine whether they are deserving of a termination.  Four hundred silent calls were received by the Rape Crisis Centre last year.  That is absolutely heartbreaking.  Imagine being a victim of rape, picking up the phone and not being able to get the words out - not a single syllable.  Some people will take a long time to report their rape and others never will, for a variety of complex reasons.<\/p>  <p>  Rape removes power and autonomy from victims.  Every single rape involves non-consensual sex and, therefore, involves an abuse of power.  The inclusion of an adjudication process for rape cases in legislation would remove even more power from raped women.  They would be judged before being allowed to access medical services.<\/p>  <p>  If rape is a specific basis for abortion, then someone will have to decide whether this basis has been satisfied.  The \"up to 12 weeks without reason\" is specifically a way to deal with this problem and to avoid retraumatising rape victims.  This is why the committee has recommended access to termination of pregnancy with no restriction as to reason.  This recommendation needs to be understood in this context.  It is not the result of some big liberalising agenda; instead, it is an act of compassion for the victims of rape.<\/p>  <p>  Abortion is already a reality in Ireland and has been for a very long time.  We just outsource the services to the UK.  Some 170,000 women that we know of have travelled for abortions since the eighth amendment was introduced.  We know that, in 2016 alone, there were approximately 3,000 requests from Ireland for abortion pills online.  One may not agree with abortion in certain or any circumstances but it is already a reality, and we owe it to women to legislate for it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700048#BBB00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1516212000,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I have to admit I am nervous this evening.

Members opposite can call it whatever they like.  I believe, however, that from the moment of conception, the person is a baby, a child to be protected in the same way we would protect a child in a pram on the street if we thought something was going to happen to that child.  I just do not agree with abortion.  I just do not think it is right.  Nothing will ever change me from that point of view.<br\/><br\/>I have given a lot of time over the years to debating this issue.  I knew eventually we would come to the stage where we are at now.

Nobody wants an Ireland like that.  Nobody wants an Ireland where, if a young lady becomes pregnant, it is as if there is something wrong with her because she became pregnant.  That is a total abomination to me.  Many young girls who became pregnant  in the past were locked up in mental institutions.  There were 1,200 or 1,300 people in mental institutions when there might not have been 50 of them who actually had a mental health problem.  They were perfectly sound, sensible people.  Many of them were young girls who became pregnant.  It was a case of shunning them away.<br\/><br\/>That is not the Ireland of today.  If a person becomes pregnant today, there are back-up services, support and family support.  There is no shame in being pregnant.  If one is married or not, that does not matter a God damn to anybody.  Nobody is judging anybody like they did in the past.  The past was a horrible time.  What happened to Joanne Hayes and other young girls who had to have their babies in private and who died while giving birth to their children, as did the children, was awful, dark and horrible.  It was described by Brinsley MacNamara in his novel, <i>The Valley of the Squinting Windows<\/i>.  We are gone from that, thanks be to God.<br\/><br\/>We are at a stage now where if a person becomes pregnant and they want to have the child, all the supports are there.  If they cannot see their own way to keeping the child, there are so many parents and young people in this country who would give anything, even the last euro in their pockets, to have a child of their own.  They might not be able to have a baby for one reason or the other but they would love to bring up a child.  Like the friend who sent me the text to which I referred earlier, they had the best of adoptive parents, highly respectable working people who gave them a great start in life.<br\/><br\/>If my viewpoint turns people against me and costs me my seat and the right to be here in this Chamber, I would gladly lose it.  All politicians are entitled to believe in what they believe - they are 100% entitled to their view - I am also entitled to my view.  A politician who will not stand for something will fall for everything.  I believe in what I believe in.  If tonight were to be my last night in the Chamber, saying these words, I mean it from the bottom of my heart that I want to stand up for the unborn children of the future.  Who am I to deny them the right to life?  Who am I to deny them the opportunity that I had to come into the world, lead a life and do everything to the best of my ability?<br\/><br\/>The recommendations that came forward from the committee were wrong.  I studied the evidence that was given.  At the time I apologised I could not attend the committee because I was chairing another committee, as Deputy Mattie McGrath knows, which was sitting at same time.  We have to be fair about the evidence given.  It was the same as the Kerry babies case and the tribunal held at the time.  When people look back at the transcript of eighth amendment committee, they will have to admit it was weighted one way and not the other.  That is the truth.  I compliment Deputies Mattie McGrath and Fitzpatrick and Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen on the sterling work they did because they were up against it.  They were unfairly outweighed and the evidence given was biased, in my humble opinion.<br\/><br\/>If we go back, people voted for the eighth amendment in huge numbers.  It has saved many lives.  It could be 100,000 lives, 50,000 lives or it could be 5,000 lives.  Thanks to that amendment, there are thousands of people living in this world today and walking the streets today who otherwise may not be here.  Now we are talking about repealing it.  This House cannot deny that the eighth amendment has saved lives.  However, the Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas committee did not hear from even one person representing those lives and those who know their child is alive today because of the eighth amendment.  How can that be fair?  How can that be democratic?  How can that be in the best interests of the people, if we gloss over such an incredible story?<\/p><p>People are alive today because of that amendment.  They have been given the right to life because of it.<\/p> <p> Buried beneath all the spin against the eighth amendment is something very positive.  It is a story of hope against the odds.  There has been a deliberate attempt to look the other way and pretend that no good has come from the eighth amendment and to keep referring to it as controversial as if it is no good and to never talk about it in a positive way.  The eighth amendment is an excellent lesson in how we can debate things today.  The lesson is that we do not debate things at all.  Too many people in this House and the media simply attack what they do not like.  Everybody in politics and the media knows that the pro-life side has been largely shut out from the process.  We were fortunate enough to have a number of strong representatives, who I have named already, on the committee.  If those three people were taken out of it, it would have been a completely weighted in one direction and it would have been a one-sided debate.  There would have been no debate except for those Members being there.<\/p> <p> I have become familiar with many stories in recent times from talking to people about this issue.  I think about the story of one woman who has spoken out about how she contemplated abortion, only to change her mind.  She talks about how grateful she is for the eighth amendment.  She says the time it took her to book an abortion and get ready to travel to England was the time she needed to change her mind.  These are very powerful stories.  That was a child, a human being, and an adult today.  At present, some pretend that when we talk about introducing abortion, it is not really going to end the lives of many babies, specifically babies with disabilities.  We hear stories and sad statistics about all the babies aborted in countries such as England or Denmark simply for having a disability.  They are truly shocking stories.  The reason over 90% of babies in these countries are aborted is for having Down's syndrome.  We really have to think about that.  I have had the privilege in my lifetime of befriending children of friends and neighbours who have Down's syndrome.  They are a joy and pleasure to know.  They have their own ways, friendly personalities and they make a contribution to life.  If we go down this road, will we have a situation in the future where people will play God with these people's lives and a person will not be born if he or she is imperfect?  I do not agree with that.  I believe that there is only one God, who is not here in this Chamber.  It is the right of these people to be born as much as anybody else.  If one is not perfect and is inside the womb, one has the same right to come into this world as the person who is perfect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700048#BBB00300","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516213200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700050#DDD00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1516213200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I passionately believe that.

At the same time, if abortion was freely and readily available in this country, they might not have had the right to come into this world because they might have been taken out of it before they had the opportunity to be born.  I do not agree with that.  I could never vote for or support that.  Who am I to come along and say that if a person is not perfect, he or she does not have the right to come into this world?  I think it is so wrong.  I will quote a couple of recommendations from the minority report, the joint assessment by Deputies Peter Fitzpatrick and Mattie McGrath and Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen.<\/p><blockquote>We reject, with particular emphasis, any attempt to provide for abortion on any particular ground of disability.  We believe that the disability ground for abortion, so prevalent in the Western World, makes a mockery of nations&rsquo; aspirations to champion the rights of people with disability.<br \/><br \/>Although Ireland has some way to travel in the championing of the rights of persons with disabilities, it can be said that Article 40.3.3., in this way also, has been a shining light.<\/blockquote><p>Think about what we are doing.  In this Chamber, we have a Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities, Deputy Finian McGrath, a person who I am great friends with.  I admire him very much.  He is an excellent Minister of State.  We have appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities while, at the same time, what we are proposing here could actively discriminate against and deny people with disabilities the right to even be born.  It is an absolute contradiction.  It does not make sense and it will never make sense.  If I am saying anything wrong or offending anybody with what I am saying, I am sorry but it is what I believe in my heart and my soul.  If I was not honest enough to stand up tonight and say what I have had to say, I should not be here at all.  I should never have been elected if I had not come in here tonight to tell the truth.  I am only saying what I am saying because I believe in it.  If I see something wrong, I say it straight.  I will not mince my words.  The recommendation states: &quot;We recommend the retention of the Eighth Amendment on the grounds that it protects both mother and unborn child, does not endanger top quality medical care for women and unborn children in pregnancy and is consistent with the best standards in the protection of human rights and human dignity.&quot;  Go back to where we are coming from.  We do not need to repeal the eighth amendment.  The <i>status quo<\/i>is acceptable and protects the mother and child.<\/p><p>We can study the values of Ireland over the years.  We and the State have made mistakes, as I have already highlighted - I quoted the Kerry babies case - and we all loathe the horrible events that have taken place in institutions of the State, such as the Magdalen laundries, and we know the mistakes we have made in the past.  At the same time, Ireland is a special place and the church in Ireland has done great things.  We can be critical and say it has done things wrong, which have to be recognised, but at the same time we have to admit and acknowledge that our church did great things in the past.  Ireland is special and I do not want to see us go down the road of England, America or other countries in Europe where human life can be so disregarded and people do not value human life or babies.  I do not agree with that.<\/p><p>When I was a young councillor and I knew abortion would be an issue at council level and in the Oireachtas, where my father was, I wanted to understand what it was all about.  I studied exactly what an abortion was.  When I saw it, it horrified me.  It made me sick, and I am tough.  It takes a lot to rattle me and anybody who really knows me knows I am not in my comfort zone talking tonight.  If I was talking about bridges or roads, I would be fighting, be on my game and be myself.  I am not myself because I am outside of my comfort zone in talking about this because I am so nervous about it due to feeling inadequate.  When I studied what an abortion was and the enormity of it hit me, I thought that if I ever had a say in it, I would always stand up for the life of the unborn child.  It is what I believe in and the way I was brought up.  I know, God be good to him, if my father and Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's father was here, exactly what he would say.<\/p><p>He would be standing up for the rights of the unborn child because he was like us.  He was an ordinary person who believed in, and cherished, life.  I have my own children who will have their own grandchildren and I have nieces and nephews.  I could never imagine a situation where a person would not want to have them.  They are the future and they will be there when we will not be here.  I want to ensure that will continue in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700050#DDD00600","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516213800,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I had the privilege of being one of the members of the joint committee.  I compliment the members of the committee and, in particular, the chairperson, who has gained a great deal of respect.  People see her as somebody with a great deal of patience and professionalism.  We spent a solid three months in public session listening to evidence.  It was a two-phase process.  The first phase was the Citizens' Assembly, which comprised many people on either side of the debate.  A significant volume of material is available which people can read or listen to as a consequence of that phase.<\/p><p>I would like to challenge something that has been said about the process.  A total of 33 witnesses appeared before the committee comprising: two from the World Health Organization; two from the GPs' association; a retired Supreme Court judge; a senior counsel who had direct experience of the X case; the obstetrician who wrote the report into the death of Savita Halappanavar; the masters of the three largest maternity hospitals in the State; the chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; a representative of the HSE; and academics and people with scientific and administrative backgrounds.  The list was balanced.  It is the kind of list that one would invite to speak if one wanted to hear evidence and that is what we did.  We decided we would not repeat the work of the Citizens' Assembly but add to the expertise that it brought forward.<\/p><p>Dr. Peter Boylan stated:<\/p><blockquote>Article 40.3.3&deg; gives rise to significant difficulties for doctors practising in Ireland and has caused grave harm to women, including death. The two outstanding examples of which I have direct personal experience are the death of Savita Halappanavar in 2012 and the case of Miss P in December 2014.  These are only two examples of cases where doctors in Ireland continue to be put in the inappropriate position of having to interpret the Constitution in the course of caring for sick women.<\/blockquote><p>It is significant that a former master of a maternity hospital would say that.<\/p><p>When we go to hospital when we are ill, irrespective of the illness, we sign a form to give consent to treatment if we face a medical procedure.  However, that does not happen when a woman is pregnant.  She cannot sign a consent form as she has no right to consent or no right to health.  Ms Mary O'Toole, who was the senior counsel on the X case, told us that the Supreme Court has the firm view that the right one has is an equal right to life and one does not have a right to health.  I addressed the issue with Professor William Binchy who was very much part of the 1983 process.  I am pleased he appeared before the committee, given others did not.  I asked him whether health is a fundamental right and he replied that it is.  However, it cannot be a fundamental right, except when a woman is pregnant.  Women are not something separate.  They are wives, partners, sisters, daughters and mothers.<\/p><p>Dr. Boylan said:<\/p><blockquote>A major difficulty with the Act is that it is entirely the responsibility of doctors to determine how close to death or how sick a woman must be before legal termination can be performed.  The woman herself has no input into the decision.<\/blockquote><p>That is pretty profound and that serious impediment was addressed at the committee.  People listened and there was a respectful attendance in the main.  He also said: &quot;It is equally well documented that countries with liberal laws and easy access to contraception have lower rates of abortion than those with restrictive laws.&quot;  If we want to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies, we have to take up the issues that were addressed in the report in respect of contraception and reproductive rights.  Dr. Boylan continued:<\/p><blockquote>If Ireland were to enact legislation in line with EU consensus, including termination without restriction up to ten weeks, our law would be among the most conservative in Europe [...] Without access to abortion in the UK, it is inevitable that Ireland would have an epidemic of illegal abortions and a massive increase in maternal mortality.<\/blockquote><p>Our proximity to the UK is a significant issue.<\/p><p>On the issue of rape, we heard from Mr. Tom O'Malley who is an expert in this area.  He said that it takes 865 days on average, or almost two and a half years, to prosecute a rape case.  The 12-week abortion limit was decided on in that context from the point of view of not putting a woman through another process after she has experienced rape.  It is impractical to deal with rape without looking at how it can be practically dealt with.  That is part of the reason 12 weeks was decided on in respect of one the recommendations by the Citizens' Assembly.<\/p><p>Professor Veronica O'Keane, who is an expert on mental health services, told the committee:<\/p><blockquote>The brain controls the body so that while one may feel sad in one's heart or anxious in one's gut, this is being directed from the brain.  Feeling emotionally distressed and highly anxious happens in one's body and leads to medical disease.  The dialogue between the body and the emotional brain is never stronger than during pregnancy [...] Pregnancy is associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms and is the highest risk period in a woman's life for depression.<\/blockquote><p>She was making the connection between the body and the mind in regard to the issue of suicide, mental health and depression.  These were the kinds of things we listened to.  I could pick out so many pieces of information that were really important.  I cannot say I went along on any day and did not come out knowing something more than when I went in, and I think that was the case for the vast majority of those who attended the committee.<\/p> <p> I believe the idea of anything other than a straightforward repeal would be a mistake and a complete abdication.  As was said by Deputy Kelleher, we all only have one vote in this when it comes to a referendum.  The people of Ireland deserve a referendum.  I am one of the few who sat on that committee who had an opportunity to vote in 1983.  As it happened, I voted not to include the eighth amendment in the Constitution.  I thought it was a mistake then and still believe it was a mistake.  However, I think we have moved on.  We have the ability to take the responsibility that this D&aacute;il should take in implementing the legislation, should the amendment be carried.  We accept the all-party report.  Although I voted for things that went beyond the report, we still accept the report.  However, I am very concerned about some of the things I have heard in recent days about the prospect of deviating from straightforward repeal.  This was an issue that was interrogated in considerable detail and I think it is most definitely the way it should be proceeded with.<\/p> <p> We hear figures for what the Irish abortion rate is but we do not know what the Irish abortion rate is.  We know there are women who will give an Irish address in the UK and we can be guaranteed those addresses will not be from one part of Ireland but from every city, town, village and rural area - from right across the country.  It was very interesting to hear the academic evidence from some of those who came in front of the committee about the identity and age cohort of women availing of abortion in the UK.  One thing that is very evident is the number of women who are now using pills to procure an abortion and doing so without medical supervision.  This is incredibly dangerous and may lead to significant health issues, not just at that point but perhaps in the future by virtue of the fact there is not the kind of medical oversight that is required.  The one thing we cannot have is that people fear seeking medical assistance in situations where there is a law which, while it has not been used, could potentially criminalise both a woman and a doctor, and impose a sentence of up to 14 years in prison.  There was very strong support for decriminalisation and we included some very strong suggestions in the report in regard to how that might be achieved.<\/p> <p> I believe this will be a difficult campaign.  I hope we will have a referendum, if not in late May, then in early June.  I hope it will be for straightforward repeal, which I think will encourage more people to get out on one side or the other.  I respect the fact people come from different viewpoints and have different opinions.  I think the tone has been set by the Citizens' Assembly, by the committee and also by this House tonight.  I hope that lead will carry out into civil society groups and the wider public.  A very important point is that we need to bring the information we heard into a much wider forum.  The responsibility for this lies with the media, with political parties and parliamentarians and with civil society groups, which I believe will be the main drivers in this campaign.  As I said, I believe anything other than straightforward repeal would be a monumental mistake and I hope that is a decision we will see sooner rather than later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700051#EEE00200","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516214400,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  First, I want to confirm my support for the holding of a referendum, my support for the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and my support for the repeal of the eighth amendment.  I wish to thank the members of the Citizens' Assembly, the joint committee and all those who have made submissions for the service they have done in dealing with this issue in a thorough, honest and sincere way.  I acknowledge this is a difficult, sensitive and emotive issue for many people, and the reasons are not hard to understand, given that intense ethical, religious, social, political and intimate personal issues coincide.<\/p><p>Irish abortion exists.  It is a reality, even though it takes place in other jurisdictions for those who can afford it, and more recently by way of the abortion pill.  It exists in a totally uncontrolled and potentially harmful way.  It must be dealt with urgently and in a compassionate and understanding way.  We cannot continue to have a situation where women's lives are at risk and where the medical profession is unclear about the legal position.  We must protect the health and safety of Irish women.  I am satisfied this requires the repeal of the eighth amendment and requires enshrining the joint committee's recommendations in legislation.<\/p><p>It is my view that there is a significant middle ground, a majority of the public, in favour repealing the eighth amendment and in favour of the recommendations of the joint committee.  In this country the debate around termination has been characterised by polarising arguments and a lack of respect for opposing positions.  I want to say I respect and understand the opposing views.<\/p><p>The eighth amendment was inserted in the Constitution following a referendum in 1983, 35 years ago.  A new generation of Irish women and men must now be allowed to have their say on the eighth amendment as they are the very ones it will affect at the most personal level.  In 1983 I publicly opposed and voted against the eighth amendment.  I did so because I believed then, as I do now, that it would have seriously detrimental effects on well-being, health and, indeed, lives of women, and that it would give rise to widespread uncertainty and confusion in legal and medical terms.  Sadly, that is exactly what happened.  We have had numerous referenda, Irish and European court cases and, sadly, deaths of women.<\/p><p>I was a member of the Oireachtas committee, chaired by former Deputy and current Senator Jerry Buttimer, which dealt with the X case and the question of suicide.  Out of the deliberations of that committee the then Minister of State, Alex White, produced the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  I put down a number of amendments to the Bill in regard to provision for terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, inevitable miscarriage, rape, incest, the criminalisation of women and the 14-year term of imprisonment.  The Government defeated those amendments, claiming they were unconstitutional.  I supported that Bill because, although it was limited and restrictive, it represented some improvement on the previous position regarding suicide.<\/p><p>I welcome the recommendations of the joint committee generally, and particularly as they deal with the various issues which I have just mentioned.  I specifically welcome the joint committee recommendation 2.11, which states:<\/p><blockquote>The Committee is of the view that no differentiation should be made between the life and the health of the woman.  This is consistent with the evidence from medical experts made available to the Committee regarding the difficulty medical professionals have in defining where a threat to health becomes a threat to life.<\/blockquote><p>I also support recommendation 2.31, which recommends that it shall be lawful to terminate a pregnancy without gestational limit where a fatal foetal abnormality is likely to result in death before or shortly after birth.<\/p><p>Currently, thousands of women take abortion pills purchased online without medical supervision.  It is urgent that a procedure be put in place for a woman to consult a doctor in such circumstances.  Therefore, I welcome the recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly and the joint committee that a termination without a stated reason be permitted up to 12 weeks.<\/p> <p> I hope that we can have a constructive and respectful debate on this issue in the next few months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700052#FFF00200","speaker":"1348","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516215000,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Next I will take members of the committee, starting with Deputies Naughton, Rabbitte and O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700053#GGG00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1516215000,"counter":477,"content":"<p>As a member of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, I will concentrate on my journey towards the position that I took.<\/p><p>Regarding the committee's approach, while we could have built on the work of the Citizens' Assembly, we regarded this as an evidence gathering stage and we brought our own judgments to bear on the issues having listened to the experts.  It is fair to say that, for many of us, this was a major learning exercise that allowed us to make informed decisions on what was a most divisive and difficult issue.<\/p><p>I consider myself pro-life and I would greatly prefer it if no woman ever had to seek an abortion.  However, I came to the committee with an open mind.  I was willing to listen to the experts and make an evidence-based decision.  Every Deputy would agree that we are in the Oireachtas to make the best decisions for citizens based on expert evidence and not our own preconceived ideas.  I was conscious of issues around rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality and the availability of termination of pregnancy in such cases.  That was as far as my thinking went prior to my committee membership.<\/p><p>I have one caveat regarding the committee's final report - I did not vote to allow abortion on health grounds.  While I appreciate the reasoning behind the position that the majority took, I am of the view that decriminalising the termination of pregnancy would be sufficient.  It would give enough scope to clinicians to make whatever good faith decisions they needed to make to protect the lives of women.<\/p><p>The ancillary recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and the all-party Oireachtas committee are as important as the issue itself.  For example, improved sex education and access to contraception, obstetric and maternity care, counselling and bereavement support services are equally important.<\/p><p>Ireland has been a cold house for victims of sexual violence since the foundation of the State.  I do not intend to go back over high-profile cases in which the State failed vulnerable men, women and children, but I would be failing in my duty if I did not mention Joanne Hayes.  I am glad to see that the Taoiseach has apologised to Joanne on behalf of the State.  No apology or monetary recompense could ever be enough to atone for what was done to her.  Let us be clear - she was not believed because she was a woman.  There was no evidence to back up the preposterous accusations being made, yet she was mentally tortured by organs of the State.<\/p><p>The evidence that our committee heard was conclusive, particularly that from Mr. Tom O'Malley.  It would be practically impossible to legislate for terminations in cases of rape or incest, as doing so would require some form of proof of rape.  Obviously, waiting for a conviction would be practically impossible.  For understandable reasons, some women never feel able to report a rape.  There is also the question of re-traumatising a woman where she has already been raped and is now pregnant as a result.<\/p><p>There is also the matter of the availability of the abortion pill.  When doing a simple Google search for &quot;abortion pill&quot;, the first few results will be for the website of the UK company from which such medicines can be bought with ease.  The latest figures estimate that up to 1,800 women in Ireland use the abortion pill every year.  These pills are illegal here, are taken unsupervised and are dangerous without medical supervision.  In the absence of shutting down the Internet, we will never be able to stop women in crisis pregnancies - women who are desperate, alone and afraid - from taking them.  We cannot have a garda at every ferry port and airport in Ireland searching for them.  Are we really suggesting a return to some kind of &quot;contraceptive train&quot; scenario?  If we do nothing, some woman in the not-too-distant future will rupture her uterus and die.  It has happened elsewhere and will happen here.  I wish to be categorical, in that no matter what the House or, ultimately, the people decide, the abortion pill will still be available and will continue to be used.  Let us not close our eyes to that fact.

Like Deputy Naughton, I have been on a journey.  I am of a particular pro-life view, but I joined the committee with an open mind.  I thank all of the committee members.  Going into the debate was daunting and nerve-racking, given the two strong viewpoints.  I would not like to believe that I would ever let anyone tell me what to do or control my thinking process, so I had not engaged with either side of the debate.  I went into it with an open mind because I wanted to engage and to listen.  Many committee members probably read between the lines quickly and knew what my position was, but they gave me the space to develop, listen, evolve, reach conclusions and become comfortable with asking questions.<\/p>  <p>  It is not an easy topic on which to have an open discussion.  It was not an easy place to be, with 20 or 22 reporters sitting there.  Some days, there was not enough space for all of those reporting on the meetings.  Despite that, we were discussing something that people might not have been comfortable discussing previously, namely, the health of women, how they were treated and how they felt.  Listening to their experiences, I quickly realised that my viewpoint or beliefs were not shared by all and that I was in the minority.  That I was in the minority was no fault of my own, but it is where I was.  However, it did not make me feel any less valued as a committee member.  Rather, it encouraged me to partake further thanks to the good chairmanship of Senator Noone and other colleagues.  They allowed me the opportunity to speak at the end of meetings and ask questions when other members might have already asked the awkward ones.  That is how I did it.  It is what settled me in, and I appreciated the opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  I have just left my parliamentary party meeting.  While I was on my journey with the committee, other Members came along with me.  They would speak to me regularly while I was going to or from its meetings and I would tell them how the work was going week in, week out.<\/p>  <p>  The committee started with Ms Justice Laffoy, who set the stage.  The masters of the Rotunda Hospital and Holles Street then appeared before us, as did the World Health Organization.  When experts appear before a committee, it paints a picture that one might not have seen previously.<\/p>  <p>  I had a regret halfway through our work.  It concerned the vote.  I dissented that day because I had still not heard everything and wanted to hear more.  I was disappointed that a vote was being taken even though no one had attended to articulate what I believed in and what my point of view was.  However, the vote was taken and we moved on.  Regrettably, people and groups then chose not to appear before the committee.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>People formed the opinion that the committee was biased, that it really did not have much basis, that the game was up and that it was over.  However, it was not over.  In fact, that was when the committee got into good discussions.  We had representatives of various groups before us, including GPs and the Rape Crisis Centre, as well as many other witnesses who discussed health and education.  That meant a lot to me because the people who were saying that the committee was biased were the first to stand up every day and leave.  They were the first people not to engage and the first to take cheap shots at other members of the committee who were willing to articulate their viewpoints.  While I say that this was a very private position for me, other people had campaigned for months and years to arrive at that day.  This was their day and they wanted to be strong and to articulate their viewpoint.<\/p> <p> I respected the committee all the way.  I respected it to the very end and even attended the launch of the committee's report.  I did not change a particular pattern when I voted.  To me, the 12-week limit was a step too far.  On my journey I got to a point where I was very comfortable with addressing the issues of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities.  The day that fatal foetal abnormalities were discussed in our committee room was a defining one for me.  A man spoke about travelling to Belfast with his good wife.  He talked about wondering how he would get there, how he would get back and how he would bring the baby back.  He and his wife could not no longer continue with the pregnancy, knowing what they knew.  They wanted the choice to abort a child that they had been told was not likely to survive.  That man battled for 11 years in terms of addressing what he had to go through.  One could feel it in the room that day that he still relives that experience.  He was very brave to come before us and share his experience.  He did so because he does not want anybody else, ever again, to go through what he experienced and neither do I.  I do not have the right to tell any couple that has conceived a baby in love, a child that is wanted, and who have been told that their child is not likely to survive, what to do.  I do not have the right to legislate or choose for them and tell them that they must leave this country.  How dare I?  I do not have that right.  That baby was wanted and loved by the couple in question.  The decision as to how they revere that child, bury that baby or bring that baby home from a hospital is theirs.  They should not have to put their baby in the boot of their car and scurry home, hoping not to get caught.  I cannot stand over that.  My conscience will not allow me.  I have a free vote and it is a vote of conscience.  I would never want to put any family through that.  That was a defining day for me and I thank the people who came before us because they were amazing.  Tears dropped in our committee room that day.  Some people looking in here this evening think that the committee members are just heartless, that we came to it from a particular position or that we are heartless people for saying something like that.  I am not heartless; I was probably one of the most compassionate people on that committee.  Indeed, we were all compassionate when we were sitting in that room listening to those stories.  Some of the ladies and gentlemen have heard this down through the years and they articulated their position in the committee.<\/p> <p> I have some regrets around the process.  As I said, I did dissent on a lot of the votes at the committee.  I voted in the negative because I would have liked more conversation around peri-natal hospice care, after care for women in this country and education.  While I accept what the Professor from Galway said at the committee that we cannot legislate for rape and incest, I do not know if the committee went far enough on that issue.  A lot of people who are looking in this evening would be more comfortable with allowing abortion on the grounds of rape and incest as opposed to the 12-week recommendation as it has been presented.  That said, I will most definitely support a referendum when a vote is called on that in the House.  I believe in democracy and that the people themselves will choose.  I have only one vote and I urge everyone else to vote.  This is a very divisive and emotive issue and the Oireachtas should enable the people to have a referendum and allow them to have their say.  I did not vote in the last referendum and I would like to have my say in this one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700053#GGG00400","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516215600,"counter":480,"content":"<p>How much time is remaining?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700054#HHH00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1516215600,"counter":481,"content":"<p>Approximately nine minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700054#HHH00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1516215600,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I would like to use my time to share with the House an email I received from a constituent on the issue of Down's syndrome.  We all know that in the coming months we will face into a referendum campaign but the more we keep saying that it is going to be divisive, the more likely it is that it will be thus.  I do not believe that it necessarily has to be divisive, unlike in 1983.  I have spoken to my mother at length about this because both she and my father campaigned against the insertion of the eighth amendment into our Constitution.  I am both grateful and proud of them for that, as it goes but of course, they were not alone in that.  When I was appointed to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, my mother was very nervous.  Even though I am a grown woman, my own mother was very nervous because she remembers what it was like in 1983.  She was worried that I would come home to find people in my front garden or people outside my office.  She was not worried that I would be physically harmed in any way but that I would be subjected to what amounts to emotional abuse.  Some of us are on the receiving end of such abuse on social media and all of the rest of it.  She was very concerned and we had discussion about it.  I told her that there was no need to worry because it will not be like that this time.  There is a wealth of information out there and we are in the position now, happily, where we can have a fact based discussion as grown ups and can come to a conclusion.  I am not sure that she is convinced and we will have to wait to see what happens.  However, the more we talk about this being a divisive issue, the more likely it is that this will be a divisive campaign.<\/p>  <p>  This is a settled matter for a large number of people.  I did not have a vote but will join with everybody else and admit that in 1983, I was ten.  People can work that one out.  I did not have a vote but I grew up in a house where issues of reproductive rights would have been spoken about.  We would have had very open and vocal conversations when we were growing up.<\/p><p>I remember the Kerry babies case well.  I remember the case of Ann Lovett.  I remember how upset my parents were about the idea that this young woman died on her own.  As I have said previously, I recall it being mentioned on the radio that it was dark when Ann Lovett and her baby died in the grotto.  That stuck with me because it was so awful.  We have to grasp the opportunity we now have to ensure this will not happen again.<br\/><br\/>I do not think the debate will necessarily be divisive because people have been reflecting on cases like those of Ann Lovett, the Kerry babies and Sheila Hodgers.  Sheila was a very good friend of my parents who died, along with her baby, at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  The hospital would not give her any pain relief because she was pregnant.  If I live to be 1,000, I will never forget the expression on my mother's face when she came back from visiting Sheila.  It was absolutely horrific.  I do not think there is a person in this State who wants to go backwards on this issue.  We are all talking about journeys.  I think we all agree that we have to go forward.  We might not agree on how far forward we should go.  Some people want to go one stop, two stops, three stops or 50 stops ahead.  My party is still engaged in an internal discussion on this matter.  That will continue, which is appropriate.  It behoves all of us to take a look at the past, to consider what has happened since 1983 and to reflect on the society we have and the society we would like.  We need to think about our daughters, granddaughters and sisters and look at what the law does to them.  We have to embrace the opportunity this will present.  It is unhelpful to say that the debate is going to be divisive.<br\/><br\/>When we put people into the mix, we should be able to get a full and rounded picture.  For that reason, I would like to read an extract from an email that was sent to me by one of my constituents:<\/p><blockquote>My wife and I have a beautiful daughter who has Down Syndrome, and it's important for us all to let our TDs know that we have no use for the 8th Amendment and the pro-life activists who claim to care about children like my daughter do not speak for us.  There are ableist attitudes and there are ethical issues regarding pre-natal screening, for sure, but the 8th Amendment ... and its continued existence does not solve them.<\/blockquote><p>I am happy to have an opportunity to share this powerful statement, which has already been highlighted on social media, with the House.  I ask people to reflect on my constituent's statement that &quot;we have no use for the 8th amendment&quot; before they start throwing into the mix spurious claims about the stages of a pregnancy when Down's syndrome can and cannot be detected.  I support the request made by these parents for us not to use their daughter in our row.  It would not be right to do so.  It is not right for us to throw spurious arguments out there.  It is not right for us to try to distort the debate.  If we stray from the facts and the evidence on which the committee focused, it is almost a guarantee of a divisive debate.  As Deputy Rabbitte and others have said, we spent a huge amount of time at the committee considering evidence, rather than opinion.  We heard from experts.  We did not choose people based on their views of the eighth amendment.  We chose people based on their expertise and the evidence they could provide.  We did not choose them for their opinions.  We all have opinions.  Evidence is what guided us at the committee.  Before the debate adjourns, I want to thank the members of the committee, including the Chairman, and all the people who gave freely of their time and provided information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700054#HHH00400","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516216200,"counter":484,"content":"<p>There will be 11 minutes remaining in this slot when this debate resumes.

When I was driving on the national primary road that passes through Carrick-on-Shannon last Friday evening, 12 January, I was unable to move my car for an hour and 45 minutes because of an accident on the Boyle side of the bridge.  There was chaos in the town because traffic on the N4 was backed up on the main Dublin to Sligo road for 5 km or 6 km.  We need to start looking seriously at these roads.  Luckily and thankfully, nobody was killed.  It is outrageous that these delays are happening fairly often because of the extra traffic on the road.<\/p>  <p>  When I spoke previously, I outlined the Fianna F&aacute;il proposal to increase the number of penalty points from three to five and to increase to &euro;500 the fine for drivers caught with blood alcohol levels of between 50 mg and 80 mg.  A number of people were angered by an aspect of my comments during the debate.  I appreciate from where they are coming.  My comments were designed to be constructive.  Based on the feedback to me and to my office, I am of the view that they reflect the views of a silent majority of those who live in our rural communities.  We need to be absolutely clear that drunk drivers can cause immense loss and suffering.  Drink-driving should never be condoned.<\/p>  <p>  Young drivers in rural Ireland are being ripped off by faceless insurance companies.  This problem needs to be looked at as well.  People living in rural areas have to buy cars so they can get to work.  It is very unfair that a young person who buys a car for &euro;1,000 might have to pay &euro;4,000 for insurance.  These people should be looked after.<\/p>  <p>  If we are serious about tackling the problems on our roads, we should roll out a major capital investment programme for the upgrading of our national primary and secondary routes.  Sligo and Leitrim county councils have been starved of money in recent years.  Part of the problem of people being killed on our roads is that many roads are not of a sufficient quality or standard.  An examination of this country's road network will reveal that south of a line between Dublin and Galway, there are motorways from Dublin to Cork, Limerick and Waterford but that north of the line in question there is a road from Mullingar to Sligo which has been there for the past 100 years. <\/p><p>The time has come to invest in our roads and to sort out the issue of road deaths.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700055#JJJ00600","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516216800,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be able to speak in support of this important legislation.  To give some background on where I stand, I do not know much about transport policy as it is not an area in which I have expertise or experience.  I do not have a driving licence or drive a car, I am not a publican and I do not live in a rural area.  However, I have closely followed this debate since the issue entered the public domain.  The reason for doing so is that I have been fortunate to have been able to spend a significant amount of time with people who have lost family members in road traffic accidents.  Members of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport heard the story of Marsia Lieghio, a beautiful 16 year old girl whose family are from my constituency.  As the committee heard, Marsia was ploughed down by a car and lost her life in 2005 in circumstances involving dangerous and reckless driving.  She died on her younger sister's birthday.<\/p>  <p>  When I was a member of South Dublin County Council, Marsia's father, Leo Lieghio, approached me because the family was trying to raise the profile of the case for stronger legislation to ensure these types of tragic and unnecessary deaths would not happen in future.  What struck me when I met Leo was that, in the midst of the deepest grief and struggling with an incredibly difficult set of circumstances that I can only imagine, he committed himself to publicly campaigning, speaking out and urging those of us in positions of some responsibility for making decisions to do something to try to tackle this very serious issue.  I gave him a commitment some years ago, before this Bill had been published, that if I was ever in a position to speak in support of or vote for a measure that had the slightest chance of ensuring other families would not be put in the same position as the Lieghio family, I would do so.  On that basis, I will say a few short words in this debate. <\/p>  <p>  Deputies will know that Leo Lieghio is a member of the Irish Road Victims Association.  In February 2017, the association held an incredibly poignant event outside Leinster House when it displayed 188 photographs of people of all ages, many of them young, who had died as a result of reckless driving.  While different circumstances applied in each of these tragic and unnecessary deaths, drink driving was a factor in many of them.  We have a responsibility to put to one side the issues raised by previous speakers in this debate and do the right thing by the families who have been bereaved as a result of reckless driving and drink driving to ensure fewer families are affected by it in future.<\/p>  <p>  At the centre of this argument is the question of what happens when a person drinks alcohol.  I have a simple rule in life, namely, I do not touch social media after I have had even one drink.  The simple reason is that my judgment is impaired when I drink alcohol.  I do not make this point flippantly but to emphasise that if I believe my judgment has been impaired to such an extent that I will not use social media, how on earth is it acceptable to get into a car, switch on the engine and drive when one's judgment is similarly impaired?  It is not that in the ordinary course - on a decent road in good weather conditions when nothing unexpected occurs - people would not drive home safely.  The issue arises when one combines the impairment of a person's judgment, even with the smallest amount of alcohol, with bad weather and another driver doing something reckless on the road.  This forces people to make a split second judgment, which they would ordinarily make correctly.  In circumstances of impairment, however, people are less able to make the appropriate judgment.  I unequivocally support the Bill for this reason.  If we accept that our judgment is impaired, even by a small fraction by alcohol, and that these impairments play a role in some road traffic accidents and road accident fatalities, there is no justification for opposing or abstaining on the Bill. <\/p>  <p>  I deliberately stated that I am not from a rural area.  I represent a large urban constituency and I am acutely aware of the seriousness of many of the issues rural Deputies from all parties raise regularly in the House.  I do not underestimate these problems but the solution to them lies not in opposing the Bill but in Deputies giving a commitment to work together to tackle them.  Deputy Scanlon spoke about the condition of roads in rural areas and he is correct.  I am familiar with the roads in his home county as I spend time there.  However, that is not an argument for opposing the Bill but one for putting much greater pressure on the Minister opposite and his Government colleagues to increase investment and tackle the problem.  I will give any Deputy who is concerned about this issue a commitment that I will work with him or her as much as I am working in support of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Some people will argue that the Bill will hurt the pub trade.  That may be the case and it is not a scenario I would welcome but if I am asked to make a choice between ensuring there are fewer deaths on our roads and ensuring the vintners trade becomes more vibrant, it is not a choice for me.<\/p>  <p>  Others argue that the real issue is one of enforcement.  I do not doubt that is the case and I will not defend the failure of the Government or the previous Government to invest adequately in Garda resources.  There is no single solution to this problem.  While greater enforcement is important and necessary, the lack of enforcement is not a reason for refusing to support the Bill.  The opposite is the case. <\/p>  <p>  I do not believe the Bill will hurt rural Ireland.  I have been reading reports in local newspapers, including some from counties Donegal, Westmeath and Kerry, about people from rural areas who have lost loved ones as a result of impaired drivers failing to make the correct decisions.  These people are also being hurt.  People in rural areas are hurting just as much as people in urban areas are hurting as a result of unnecessary deaths on our roads.  Again, while I am not from a rural area, if I want to do the right thing by people in rural areas, as I want to do by my constituents, supporting this Bill is a small but nonetheless important step to make. <\/p>  <p>  I will only use half of the time available to me because it is important that the Bill progresses to Committee Stage as quickly as possible.  I have no idea how many lives would be saved as a result of this Bill and I do not believe anybody examining the evidence that has become available since the start of this debate could say with any certainty how many lives would be saved.  However, I am certain that it has the potential to save some lives.  If we tackle enforcement, improve roads and address other areas of transport policy, we could save even more lives.  If the Bill has the potential to save even one life, every Deputy has a responsibility to support it and ensure one life is saved, if for no other reason than to ensure that one family does not have to experience the grief, trauma and pain that Marsia Lieghio's family experienced after her untimely, unacceptable and unnecessary death and continue to experience every day.<\/p>  <p>  I urge Deputies who are wavering or considering abstaining in the vote and those who are committed to voting against it to reconsider their position.  If they want us to work with them on the other issues that have been highlighted, I will give them a commitment to do so to have the issues addressed.  I appeal to them, however, not to stand in the way of this significant and important legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700056#KKK00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1516216800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Having listened carefully to the debate tonight and before Christmas, I am a little concerned about some of the comments on the Bill and the tone and attitude displayed in some of the contributions towards people who raise concerns about the measures in it.  It is becoming an increasingly common feature of society that people who raise concerns and ask for more reasoned dialogue are vilified as outliers, pariahs and filibusterers who are responsible for killing people on our roads and so forth.  That is not helpful because no Member is in favour of making the roads less safe or jeopardising anyone's life.<\/p><p>I understand and fully support the desire and efforts to make our roads safer - I genuinely believe everyone does.  I accept the point that even one death on the road is one death too many.  However, that does not mean I do not have the right to raise concerns about the legislation or to question its effectiveness, and I do question it.  I do not believe that tone is helpful.  It is something that we should examine as a society.  If a person is against criminalising the purchase of sex, suddenly that person is in favour of exploiting women.  If a person supports the call to end the sanctions on Syria, somehow that makes the person a supporter of Bashar al Assad.  If a person raises questions about this legislation, she is irresponsible, a gombeen and a pariah and is jeopardising people's lives.  That is not on.  I do not believe that is healthy or that it is a good way of debating issues.  We should be more adult about it, as it were.<\/p> <p> I have listened to much of the debate.  I still do not know what I think about it.  However, some valid points have been raised to question the effectiveness of the proposal, especially in the context of other major issues where road safety and lives are being put at risk.<\/p> <p> Let us deal with some of those points.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin made the point that we know this legislation will save some lives.  I do not know that is the case and I have not seen the evidence in that regard.  We are talking about increasing the punishment at the lower level of alcohol consumption.  How do we know that will save lives?  It may or may not.  That is what we are doing.  To me, it is not seriously effective.  When we cut back the padding, essentially we are creating a new category of disqualification for drink-driving.  That is it in a nutshell against a backdrop of major other issues that need to be addressed.<\/p> <p> At present, if an experienced driver has more than 80 mg but less than 100 mg per 100 ml of blood, the person will be disqualified for six months under the administrative system.  If the person goes to court for the offence, she will face a year of disqualification.  By contrast, an experienced driver with a blood alcohol content of more than 100 mg but less than 150 mg who goes to court will face a two-year ban.  The Bill creates a new category for disqualification at lower levels of blood alcohol content.  This affects an experienced driver with between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml of blood.  Such a person will be disqualified for three months under the administrative process as against the current penalty of three penalty points.<\/p> <p> I am in two minds.  I have listened to the debate.  I was particularly struck by the contribution of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and the points he made around the issue of proportionality.  I believe they were important.  He made the point that the Bill, if enacted, will have a major and disproportionate effect on those living in Ireland without any access to public transport.  Tens of thousands of people have been left to rely on their cars because of generations of abysmal spatial planning, turning a blind eye to one-off houses everywhere and our consistent failure to invest in public transport.<\/p> <p> Let us suppose a person in rural Ireland falls foul of this legislation and ends up losing a licence for three months.  That person will have to get a taxi to work, if there are even taxis in the area.  If the children have to be brought to school, the person is going to have to get taxis to bring them to school, depending on work patterns.  This is happening against a backdrop where the Government has viciously cut back on school transport services over recent years.  It is something that affects people in rural areas in my constituency and in general.  It is an issue I am contacted about frequently.  If someone cannot drive and there is no service from the State to pick up the slack and help people to get their children to school, then we have a problem.<\/p> <p> Let us suppose a person in Dublin runs up against the legislation and is disqualified.  That person can get the bus, train or Luas for three months and it would not be the end of the world.  Obviously, it would be a slight inconvenience but it is not really a big deal for such people.  For me, that is incredibly unfair.  There is a basis to Deputies raising concerns about this.<\/p> <p> If there is to be a sanction, then it should apply to all equally rather than penalise some groups more than others.  The impact of the penalty because of all the other issues means we are disproportionately impacting one group of people rather than others.  In some ways it is a little like the argument for linking fines to income.  A &euro;120 clamp-removal fee is nothing to someone earning &euro;100,000 but a great deal for someone on the minimum wage.  By not linking fines to income, we are setting up a situation whereby there is one law for the poor and another for the rich.  The poor are forced to abide by the law while the rich can do what they like and soak up the sanction.  This Bill is a little like that.  We are creating a heavy sanction for those in rural areas and a lighter one for those in cities.  That is simply a point of fact.  It is not right, but it is a consequence of other Government policies.<\/p> <p> One could make the argument that all a person has to do is not have a drink at all.  If that is the case, we should outlaw the use of alcohol at all levels.  Why do we have a discriminatory impact?  What if we said there should not be different categories or that we would disqualify anyone even for a small level of alcohol?  The reason there are different levels is that there are differences.  I believe most adults accept that there is a difference.  There is a difference between drunk driving and someone who goes out once a week to collect the pension in a rural area and have a pint and who then drives home on the same rural road that she always drives on.  That is part of the way of overcoming isolation and so on.  There is a major difference between the person who maybe had had a pint or two all her life and people who go out and have ten pints and then get behind a car when they cannot even put the key in.  We have different categories in the first place to recognise that situation.  It is going to have a serious impact.<\/p> <p> There is an irony or hypocrisy in this.  The statistics tell us that if we want to deal with road deaths and appalling tragedies &ndash; I fully accept that we all do &ndash; then we should start with the main things that cause it.  Speeding is a far bigger cause or killer than drink driving, especially in this era.  Young people are far better educated now about the negative impact of drink driving.  Fewer young people drink drive now than they did in the years when I was growing up.  It is frowned upon by society.  Already we have created a climate whereby most people accept that it is unacceptable to drive while drunk.  It is absolutely frowned upon.  I do not think we have reached the same place in terms of speeding, yet speeding has a far bigger impact.<\/p> <p> Many of the young men who love their cars do not drink because they are saving money to spend on the car, yet they go out speeding.  We need to educate people in that regard.  There should be mandatory classes in all schools on road safety, how to use cars and so on.<\/p> <p> Another point relates to mobile telephones.  I believe it could be scientifically shown in the case of most people, regardless of their physiological composition, that trying to use a mobile telephone while driving is far more dangerous than someone driving after one drink.  Using the telephone necessitates the user taking her eye off the road.  There is recognition of this point in our legislation now in the context of the different gradings.  Again I come back to the point.  It is terrible that we have to do it.  No doubt when one raises any question, the viewpoint is going to be distorted and somehow portrayed as condoning drunk driving.  It comes back to the point that we are talking about changing the penalty at the low level of alcohol in the blood.  What we should be doing is dealing with deterrent.  It should be a question of how we deter people rather than how we punish people.  I do not accept that a punishment of this character is necessarily a deterrent and I have not seen evidence to support that view.<\/p> <p> One thing has struck me as ironic.  We have so little time and resources in the House to move legislation.<\/p><p>All the emphasis is being put on this as a catch-all but I do not see it.  We already have rules in place and there is a bitter irony that, while we are having this discussion and putting it forward as a solution to the problems, we also know what has happened in this State in the recent period.  I refer to 2 million phantom breath tests and widespread phantom mandatory alcohol test checkpoints.  We have legislation but garda&iacute; mismanaged it by fraudulently returning figures and stating they held checkpoints when that was not the case.  Why did that happen?  It happened, in part, as a result of the reduction in Garda numbers and traffic corps numbers have been depleted recently.  They remain depleted by comparison with what they should be and if we really want safety on our roads, we can help it not so much by changing legislation as by having real checkpoints carrying out real breath tests on people who try to break the law.  It would have a greater deterrent impact than any piece of paper on the subject and I am at a loss as to why we have not pushed this forward.<\/p> <p> It is not just an issue for rural Ireland, even though there is a big impact there.  There are parts of Dublin and other cities where there is a chronic dearth of public transport.  It would be remiss of me not to mention my own constituency, where Swords is incredibly poorly served by public transport, despite having a population of over 45,000 and being bigger than Drogheda.  Instead, it relies on a private bus service and a Dublin bus service that comes nowhere near to delivering to our population.  We hear a lot of talk about metro north, which has been going on for years and years, but nothing has happened.  One would find it very difficult to get around if one lived in Fingal without a car.  Given the size of the population, this state of affairs is genuinely mind-boggling.  People in both rural and urban areas deserve the choice of getting public transport to wherever they want to go but, instead of moving with the times and increasing public transport provision, we are facing massive fines for missing our emissions targets and the Government is coming up with hare-brained bus routes which are put out to tender for private companies, something the dogs on the streets could say will not properly service the areas in question but will simply force more people back into their cars.  This just creates a vicious circle.<\/p> <p> I am in two minds about this Bill and I do not know how I view it.  I know for sure, however, that it is not the solution to the problems on our roads.  I am highly sceptical that it will make even a bit of a difference.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin said it might save one life but I am not sure it will even do that.  The Bill deals with a lower level of alcohol against a backdrop in which there is no enforcement.  If there is no enforcement, the most vicious and penalising policy will not make a blind bit of difference.<\/p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made the excellent point that the Bill disproportionately punishes people who are already suffering the effects of terrible Government policy in the shape of a lack of investment in public transport and the gutting of many rural areas, with the social and mental health problems that go with that.  In terms of proportionality, this is poor legislation.  We all want to put an end to drink-driving deaths but I have not heard sufficient argument to convince me this is the best or fairest way to achieve that goal.  I do not think it takes enough of an overview of modern Irish society and the increasing prevalence, for example, of drug use.  If we were really serious about these issues we would deal with them from the point of view of planning, public transport, investment on our roads, and our education system to provide a deterrent and awareness.  Critically, we would approach it from the point of view of enforcement of the legislation already there.<\/p> <p> I look forward to hearing the rest of the debate because, with my hand on my heart, I cannot say what way I feel about the Bill at the moment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700056#KKK00300","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516218000,"counter":494,"content":"<p>As Deputy Daly said, no one in here condones people who drink and drive and our hearts go out to people who have lost family members as a result of drink-driving.  As legislators, however, we have to ask if our legislation has worked for people who are three or four times over the limit, as is the case in 93% of those caught in cases where people have been killed.  The answer, realistically, is \"no\".<\/p>  <p>  Over Christmas I heard comments linked with the Minister to the effect that Deputies were filibustering and holding up legislation that would have saved people's lives.  There is a process in the D&aacute;il whereby all elected Deputies have a right to represent their views and the views of those who went to the ballot box and voted for them.  There is a committee system and there are Senators who also have a right to represent their views, so even if the Bill had gone through the D&aacute;il on the day before Christmas it would still have had hurdles to overcome.  Levelling such accusations at Deputies is not a good idea.  Nobody condones someone who drives having drunk way over the limit but we have to ensure we recognise the severity of any crime which has taken place.  With this Bill, however, we are deciding to put people with between 50 mg and 80 mg of alcohol in their blood off the road.<\/p>  <p>  I come from and understand rural Ireland.  We do not have the Luas, Dublin Bus or the DART running until midnight so that we could have a social drink and get home by public transport.  People who live in rural areas are and will continue to be treated in a disproportionate way, not only in this area but in respect of many other issues.  If we want to apportion blame for the loss of lives we have to look at the history of Governments down through the years.<\/p><p>We have seen report after report stating that 14% of the roads are not fit to travel on and have caused accidents.  Will anything be done about that or will we hear of that coming out?  No, for the simple reason that it costs money.  The traffic corps came up in the programme for Government.  We have heard announcement after announcement that it was going up to a higher level than was the case going back the years.  Unfortunately, that has never been done.  No matter what legislation is in place, unless we have feet on the street we will never solve it.  Of course, that costs money and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, might not like opening the purse strings.  It is easier to put in legislation that has a disproportionate effect in rural parts of Ireland.  <\/p> <p> I heard so-called solutions coming from the Government just before Christmas, when it was trying to soften its own Deputies, to the effect that we would get 35 buses.  When people go to a pub for a night out - down the country anyhow, they might do it differently in Dublin - they go between the hours of 9 p.m. and 12 midnight.  If the 35 buses were driving at their maximum speed without picking up anyone, for three hours at night without going up a by-road or a back road, for those three hours all 35 would be needed in County Galway alone, where there are 5,000 km of road.  If we divide that by the number of buses, without the drivers even pulling up to bring anyone, they would not even cover County Galway.  It is a red herring trying to soften the blow and telling people the Government is going to do something down the way.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, in 63% of accidents in which people have lost their lives there is basically no drink and no real answers.  We have to be mindful of statistics.  My understanding is that the statistics we have are based on the years 2008 to 2012.  With the best will in the world for the top echelons of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, some of the statistics we have got over the past year or two have not been what I would call very accurate.<\/p> <p> We have an organisation called the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  I sat on the transport committee of the previous D&aacute;il and the RSA appeared before it.  We decided that we would bring up ways of trying to save lives and to help young people who are scourged with the cost of insurance through no fault of their own.  I am fairly familiar with lorries.  It is possible to put a limiter into a lorry, which no doubt can be done with cars.  It is actually easier now because they can be programmed on the computer system.  I put it forward that we would give every young person insurance, the same as me or anybody else who has been driving for a good few years with a clean licence, providing they were willing to put in such a limiter until they were 23, 24 or 25.  In fairness, some of them are very good drivers.  Let us not tar all of them with the one brush.  Was it done?  No, because it was not attractive to do.  If we found a solution to bring down insurance, it would not fit and the insurance companies would probably give us the two fingers anyhow.  All they are interested in is making sure these youngsters are paying premium rates.<\/p> <p> I also see this new thing coming in regarding the learner drivers.  While we are great at bringing in legislation, we are not that fond of bringing in solutions.  I have checked and am correct that there are waiting lists of up to six months in some places for doing a driving test.  All I hear is that it will be sorted but that is the reality on the ground.  While the Minister might be used to his Luas and his DART and all his different public transport methods, in rural parts of Ireland, especially on family farms where families are living on an income of &euro;15,000 to &euro;18,000, where families try to give the next generation a chance of going to college, they often cannot afford the exorbitant rates in the likes of Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway where the colleges are situated.  Those people have bought cars for their youngsters but now they will have to sit in the cars with them, go to college and come back again.<\/p> <p> Why do we not bring in a solution in which we put a place in every county like Mondello Park, where people could do an intensive two, three or four days - whatever it takes - or two weekends?  There would be someone there to provide a certificate stating that while the person has a learner permit, he or she has gone through a certain amount of intensive training and is fit to drive on the road until he or she gets to do the test, given the current waiting lists.  However, as that probably would be using our heads and making it a bit easier for people, the answer is \"no\".  Given the disproportionate lack of public transport, some of those 17 or 18 year-olds will be deprived of college because of this as unfortunately, their parents will not be able to afford what is needed.  <\/p> <p> It is well known - this is not just during the Minister's tenure but in the past four, five, six or seven years - that the roads budget is down 40% from what is was in 2008 in certain counties.  If it is that much down, one definitely will not have the quality of roads that is required.  The Minister sat within at the programme for Government discussions.  One of the first things that was put in it was that the west of Ireland would be brought in for TEN-T funding.  The Minister's comrade, Deputy Enda Kenny, was to the fore in that regard along with myself.  The present Taoiseach, however, decided he would take the west of Ireland out of it and make sure that the likes of Foynes and other areas like Cork and Dublin were tied in, while the whole of the Border, midlands and western region was taken out of it.  That was one of the first things written into the programme for Government in order that we would get better quality roads.  Was it done?  Was it looked at?  Was anything even stirred in it?  When I last checked before Christmas, the answer was \"no\".  <\/p> <p> Then we talk about trying to save lives.  I ask myself what type of a society we are becoming.  I saw a 90 year-old man who went to the pub every night for two glasses of beer.  With the talk and the fear that exists about all this, unfortunately the gentleman has become a prisoner within his own home.  We talk about rural isolation.  Whether it is a cup of tea, a glass of beer or Guinness or a mineral, we must understand that bit of communication is important to many people, especially in the west where there is a large percentage of elderly people who would like to go out for a glass or two. <\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>There is a fear of even going out on the road.  That is what the Bill is doing in terms of drink-driving legislation.<\/p> <p> I know our hearts have to go out to all of the families who have lost people and we have to remember them.  What will solve the problem of the driver who is three, four or five times over the limit?  What will stop people doing that?  <\/p> <p> There is another side to this issue.  Every family, including mine, has somebody belonging to them who has a problem with drink.  Solving that problem and turning a new leave over in a book will help the family and the person concerned.  We need to consider all of the different angles in trying to resolve this issue.  Everyone wants safe roads.  That is undeniable.  Everyone wants to make sure that people are not killed.  A person walking down a road who has drink on him or her is entered into the statistics as a drink-driving accident, but it is not determined whether the person walking on a road or the driver had been drinking.  It is simply recorded as a road traffic accident where drink was involved. <\/p> <p> Speed is a major problem.  Before the Minister goes forward with legislation, he needs to bring in solutions.  Unfortunately, down through the years Governments have been very good at introducing legislation and think it will solve everything.  We can have all of the legislation in the world from every Department, but unfortunately that does not work. <\/p> <p> County councils are doing their best with the funds they have.  The Minister will make announcements in the coming months.  Whether the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, likes it, the Minister, Deputy Ross, needs to get a budget which will enable infrastructure to be put in place.<\/p> <p> We have many problems in rural parts of Ireland.  It is one of the best places one could live.  Knowingly or unknowingly, however, Departments seem hellbent on making sure that they try to drive people away from rural Ireland.  The national planning framework does not want to allow one-off housing in rural parts of Ireland.<\/p> <p> We also have to be mindful of people who may go out at night with their partners and families and have a few drinks.  The following morning they are lambs to the slaughter because they run into a checkpoint.  The problem is that they do not know whether they are over the limit if they had a few drinks night before.<\/p> <p> The Minister should rethink the Bill because it is punitive for rural Ireland.  The Minister is sounding the final death knell for rural pubs which have struggled for the past number of years.  It will finish off the sector.  Is that a legacy the he wants?  Other solutions have been given to the RSA.  Funnily enough, it seems hellbent on picking up on this aspect.<\/p> <p> People who passed their tests years ago have been told that because records are not available due to the fact that everything was burned in 1990, they have to prove something which cannot be proven.  People cannot pull trailers even though they have been doing so for the past 20 years.  That is the type of thing that is happening.<\/p> <p> Lorry owners have submitted their lorries for testing.  It cost one man &euro;750 because the test was due.  He booked his lorry in and there were a few small issues.  He had to transport a load of cattle but the lorry was taken from him.  That is what happened to a small business in a small part of Ireland.  I hope the Minister takes on the board what I have said.  People in rural parts of Ireland should not be disproportionately affected by the Bill.<\/p> <p> Buses will not solve the problem because about 1,000 of them would be needed.  They cannot travel on boreens, back roads and by roads.  The Minister may have a bigger problem in terms of rural isolation.  I ask the Minister not to sound the final death knell for rural parts of Ireland and their pubs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700058#MMM00200","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516219200,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Like Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I have sat in the parlours of the homes of families who have lost people as result of drink-driving.  It is not a very pleasant experience.  I am sure many of my colleagues have done the same.  Speaking from the point of view of the profession from which I come, I have perhaps a more intimate knowledge of the destruction caused by deaths from drinking and driving.<\/p>  <p>  The central premise of Bill is to change the penalty in respect of drinking and driving.  It is not a proposal to lower the limit.  In that regard, it is a very warranted measure and I will support the Bill.  The motivation behind the legislation is to save lives and avoid injury to those who drive above the limit, their passengers and other road users.  We are not just talking about drivers, but a much wider group of people who will be affected by the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  This is not an urban or rural issue; rather it is a national issue.  It is not about the driver or the pub.  It is about the death and serious injury of people on the roads.  It is about changing people's attitudes to alcohol in general and drink and driving in particular.  We have a very serious problem in this country in regard to alcohol.  To compound that by not taking drinking and driving seriously is negligent in the extreme.<\/p>  <p>  Road safety depends on many factors, including speed, road quality, the roadworthiness of cars, weather conditions, carelessness, tiredness, inexperience and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs.  Road safety is multifactorial.  Like many issues in our society, there is no one factor.  Many factors add to death and serious injury on our roads.  We should take every opportunity to try to reduce the number of fatalities and serious injuries on our roads.  We should remember that a car is a lethal weapon and if it is used in an irresponsible manner, it leads to very serious consequences.  <\/p>  <p>  I wish to refer to two issues.  <\/p><p>This is a public health issue on two counts.  It is a public health issue in relation to preventing injury and death on our roads.  It is designed to protect drivers, passengers, pedestrians and fellow road users, their neighbours and friends.  Many accidents happen within the locality of the driver, possibly injuring or killing himself or herself or people who live in the community.<\/p> <p> Road fatalities are not the only statistic on which we should measure the proposed legislation.  When we are discussing road safety we must also remember that many more people are seriously injured than die on the roads, perhaps by a factor of ten.  Many of the injuries are very serious and life changing.  If one visits the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, one will see many people there who have spinal injuries and brain injuries as a result of road traffic accidents, which have life-long consequences.  They are not injuries that people get over lightly.  We should not just discuss this measure in terms of road deaths on the basis that it saves ten, 20 or 30 deaths, but that one might save hundreds of people serious, life-changing consequences. That must be used as a measure and not just deaths on the roads.<\/p> <p> It is also a public health issue in terms of bringing home to people the excessive level alcohol consumption that goes on in this country.  Although Ireland is not unique in this regard, we have a serious problem with alcohol consumption.  We all received a glass today in our office indicating the safe level of alcohol consumption.  It is 11 units for women and 17 units for men.  There is a safe level of alcohol which we must consider.  Liver failure is now a disease of young people and the consumption of alcohol is a concern.  Binge drinking in this country is very serious.  We must speak also about the public health aspect of alcohol in society.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il is opposed to the Bill.  One of the main reasons for its opposition is because drivers may be stopped the morning after the night before and be found to be above the legal alcohol level.  That is a very spurious argument because it does not matter what time of the day or night one is over the limit, one is still over the limit and if one is over the limit, one is a danger to oneself and other road users.  If one is over the limit on one's way to work and one gets to work without being detected, then one is putting one's fellow workers at risk due to the level of alcohol in one's blood if one is operating a machine, on scaffolding or driving as an occupation.  The Fianna F&aacute;il position is all the more surprising given that it introduced a smoking ban in public places which was a wonderful public health initiative and it has now become self-policing because if one smokes a cigarette in a public place now, it is the members of the public who will police one and not the authorities.  I hope that in years to come that will be the case with alcohol as well.  It is disappointing that Fianna F&aacute;il is opposing the Bill, especially on that spurious ground.<\/p> <p> I wish to address the issue of social isolation, in particular in rural areas although we should also bear in mind that there is substantial social isolation in urban areas too.  Going to the pub is not an answer to social isolation.  Not everybody drinks alcohol or enjoys the pub culture.  In fact, I think the majority of people in rural areas do not use the pub and drink and drive home.  The majority do not drink and should not be put at risk by those who do.  Many social activities happen in rural areas which have nothing to do with alcohol.  My local community centre is used seven nights a week.  The biggest card night in the community is held there and it is alcohol-free.  Tea and scones are served.  It is the most well attended card night in the area.  People are home by 11 p.m.  Many people are driven there by their relatives and also driven home by them.  I do not see why that cannot happen if people want to go to the pub.  In our community, we also have arts and crafts, computer studies, local history and many other social activities so going to the pub is not the mainstay of activities in rural areas.<\/p> <p> Rural society is much more resilient than depending on the pub culture.  I come from a rural area and I have heard many speakers say that this Bill will make people house-bound, but I do not believe that for a moment.  Enjoying alcohol sensibly in pubs is good for some people.  There is no denying that, but drinking and driving should not be part of that enjoyment.  Rural Ireland should not be seen as revolving around the pub culture and, unfortunately, many activities, even sporting activities for young people, revolve around presentations in pubs.  That is a serious issue because it sends the wrong message to young people.<\/p> <p> There is a growing sense of responsibility among young people in rural and urban areas.  There is a sense that it is no longer acceptable to drink and drive.  That is beginning to grow among young people and it is evident in other age groups as well.  Our efforts should be concentrated on a much broader range of measures to address social isolation, which does not involve alcohol.  Not all alcohol is consumed in pubs.  Many people drink at home and then get into their cars and drive, or they go to their friends or acquaintances and drink alcohol and drive.  The Bill is not directed entirely at the pub trade, rather at the principle of not drinking and driving.  The point is that if one drinks, wherever it is, one should not drive, regardless of whether that is in the pub, at home or in a friend's house.<\/p> <p> We now know that losing one's driving licence for three months is the consequence of driving while over the alcohol limit.  That is a very important message to get out to people, namely, that there is a limit of 50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  That does not confine one to having no alcohol as it allows one to have a drink, but I would recommend that people who have a drink should not drive.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to the fact that he would not go on social media after a drink and I would strongly recommend that.  I would also strongly recommend that one does not go on a gambling website after having a drink so why would one get into a car and drive after a drink?  The legislation provides leeway and a tolerance for 50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood and that is a reasonable limit.<\/p> <p> It is scientifically proven that there is an escalating reduction in reaction time when one drinks.  The more one drinks, the worse one's reaction time will be, so if one is under the 50 mg, one's reaction time is still affected but the law will give one some leeway.  That has to be considered.  There is a myth that people drive much better after a couple of pints.  Of course that is completely ludicrous.  There is also a myth that if one has a large meal, one is going to be a danger on the road.  That is also something which cannot be believed.  Alcohol is a drug and it can be dangerous.  If misused, it can be lethal so it is not something to be dismissed lightly.  There is a ripple effect in terms of deaths and injuries on the roads.  If someone is killed for any reason involving alcohol, that affects the person's family, friends, work colleagues and community.  Hundreds of people are affected by it for the rest of their lives.  It is not just one person, but many, who are affected by each incident on the road.  The issue should not be measured purely on the number of deaths but on the number of very serious injuries that also occur.<\/p> <p> I believe there is overwhelming support for this Bill.<\/p><p>The Irish Road Victims' Association held a vigil outside the D&aacute;il a number of months ago at which it had a candle for each person killed on the roads in the previous year.  There were 198 candles.  When one passes something like that, it brings home to one the extent of the problem.  Of course, not all 198 victims were killed because of alcohol, but a significant number were.  As many speakers have said this evening, if we can save even one life, it will be worthwhile.  This legislation will save many more than one and must be taken seriously.<\/p> <p> The Road Safety Authority was spoken about tonight.  I have great respect for it.  The number of deaths on our roads has diminished substantially in recent years.  There used to be 400 or 500 deaths per year; now there are 200, as a result of many measures to improve road safety.  Drink-driving is one factor that affects road safety.  It is not often that we have a Bill in this House that can save lives directly.  This is one such Bill.

Many have spoken on it and on the issue of drink-driving.  If one spoke to everybody in this House regarding drink-driving, one would realise each knows somebody who died from it.  Unfortunately, I know people who have died from it.  If this Bill saves one life, it will be worth it.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, many people are killed on our roads every year.  Last year, in the region of 157 to 160 people died.  Many of these deaths were not due to drink-driving.  Many were because of young people driving at speed and because of people losing control of their cars.  Many of the Road Safety Authority messages on the television at night are about people who use their phone when driving.  There are many reasons people get killed on our roads.  In some cases, deaths are attributable to the state of the roads in the countryside.<\/p>  <p>  With this Bill, the Minister is trying to do what he believes is right, that is, reduce the number of deaths on our roads.  This should be achieved in conjunction with implementing other measures.  There should be more policing.  I believe many more people are killed on the roads due to speed and using mobile phones, particularly for texting.  One loses sight of what one does when using a phone to send text messages.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, in rural Ireland we do not have a proper public transport system.  When the Minister is summing up and taking Committee and Report Stages of this Bill, I urge him to come up with a scheme that could provide some sort of transport service in rural areas.  People living in major towns and cities do not have to worry about this Bill because they have public transport.  They can get on the bus at 7 p.m. and come home at 9 p.m. after a few drinks.  Unfortunately, in rural Ireland we do not have a public transport system.  In conjunction with the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport should consider putting a scheme in place so publicans could provide a transport system that would enable customers to be brought home after going out to enjoy a drink, particularly at the weekends.  Perhaps the car provided by the publican could be exempt from vehicle registration tax or road tax, or some sort of grant scheme could be put in place to allow somebody to drive people home in the rural countryside.<\/p><p>Rural towns and villages are suffering.  Many local GAA clubs are not able to field a hurling or football team due to emigration.  Recently, a gentleman in north Connemara told me some parishes there cannot field a GAA team.  Perth in Australia, however, which had not one single GAA team seven years ago, now has nine.<\/p> <p> When I was 19 years of age, I got my first job and bought my first car.  My father, in his later years, used to love to go out for a few pints every evening at 7 o'clock.  I used to pick him up to bring him home around 9.30 p.m. or 10 o'clock.  I would not only just bring home my father but give a lift to five other elderly people who had been in the pub.  I could do that at the time.  Unfortunately now however, there are not many young people in many towns and villages who can offer that service to bring home a few elderly people who might want a few pints in the evening.  Will the Minister examine some sort of a scheme which could give back to rural areas?<\/p> <p> Some Members spoke about the cause of traffic accidents on rural roads.  If one looks at the side roads and byroads, the briars and bushes cannot be cut until certain times of the year.  This also causes accidents and needs to be examined.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister look at some scheme to keep pubs in rural areas open?  For many elderly people living in rural areas, the only person they might meet is the postman delivering the mail or when they go to Sunday mass.  I know of one instance of an individual who used to pick up his pension, regular as clockwork at 2.30 p.m. every Tuesday, at his local post office, have a few pints and then drive home.  One Tuesday, he did not collect his pension.  The postmistress called the local garda&iacute; who went to his house to discover he had fallen and broken his hip.  Will the Minister look at a scheme, along with the Minister for Finance, whereby several publicans could buy a car, which would be exempt from the VRT, to transport people in rural areas to the local pubs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700062#QQQ01100","speaker":"1313","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516220700,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017.  Any fatality on the roads is one too many.  I send my profound sympathies to those families who have lost loved ones.  I say that from the bottom of my heart.  I have met families whose family members were either killed or injured on the roads due to drink driving.<\/p><p>Members raise issues here which are of significant concern to their constituents.  We are elected by our constituents and we have to make up our own minds on legislation and deal with it when it comes before us.  However, we are treated by colleagues here and elements of the media as pariahs when we raise concerns, whether on the eighth amendment, road traffic legislation, the failing agricultural economy and the fodder crisis.  There is this kind of disdain shown to us and we are told to move on from this because it is distant.  We are a small island country off the west coast of Europe that depends on the agricultural economy and the whole fabric of rural Ireland.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, has been a good friend of mine over the past nine years.  We have had many a robust debate on this Bill.  When he came to Tipperary on his way back from west Cork one evening, my daughter, M&aacute;ir&iacute;n, and I took him to look at a bridge in Aherlow.  We took the Minister in my daughter's car for a short drive along 18 miles.  We showed him eight pubs along the route which had been closed.  I am not speaking on behalf of the vintners.  I have met the vintners once on this Bill but we meet lobbyists all the time.  Every pub pays rates, income tax and staff wages.<\/p><p>Deputy Harty is more qualified than I am to speak about the impact of alcohol and meals on people.  However, in many rural areas, the pub is the last place standing.  Many rural areas do not have other venues such as a community hall or a hotel.  It is unfortunate that many presentations after matches are made in public houses.  However, it can be the only place available.  Pubs do a great service.  Some of them have kept lounges which are used occasionally on which they pay rates.  They are maintained to a reasonable standard for functions such as after funerals.  Funerals in rural areas allow the community to come together to empathise and sympathise with a family over a loss.  It shows how the community spirit and meitheal is still alive and well.<\/p><p>I was involved in the talks for the programme for Government.  One point we drove home every day in the talks, which the Minister sought with his Independents group, was the rural-proofing of legislation.  It has got worse now, however.  We were told by the then Taoiseach during those talks that every Bill would be rural-proofed but none of them is.  If this Bill were rural-proofed, there would be a wide range of provisions in it to address these rural concerns.<\/p><p>The Bill's explanatory memorandum states:<\/p><blockquote>The Bill will remove the penalty points option in certain cases and thereby ensure that all drivers intercepted while driving over the legal alcohol limit will receive a disqualification.  In place of the current three penalty points provided in these cases, the Bill will introduce a three-month disqualification period.<\/blockquote><p>The car is a vital mode of transport in rural areas.  Fianna F&aacute;il has suggested amendments.  The Rural Independent Group will also be tabling amendments.  We feel this Bill is too harsh and has not been rural-proofed.<\/p><p>One day Deputy Heydon threw out a figure of &euro;1 million for rural transport schemes.  I was a founder member of Ringalink in south Tipperary, Carlow and Kilkenny.  I know the costs involved and &euro;1 million would not even cover a feasibility study, never mind putting on buses in rural areas.  We tried to provide a Christmas bus service for four villages, but it did not work out, even with the best will in the world.  Deputy Heydon's &euro;1 million was only a sop to appease people's concerns about this legislation.<\/p><p>Rural areas are hammered every day of the week and are abandoned.  The latest OECD figures show that 52% of all economic activity in this country is inside the Pale and Dublin.  That is not good or healthy.  If the unfortunate homeless people in this city had a car, they would sleep in it.  However, we see people in different rural towns sleeping in cars.  Rural Ireland is sadly forgotten.<\/p><p>Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan adhmad?  T&aacute; deireadh na gcoillte ar l&aacute;r.  The Minister's Irish may not be great.

I had an issue with the regulations around the laden weight of a three-axle vehicle which the Minister addressed with the stroke of a pen.<\/p><p>Countless Ministers have refused to sign this statutory instrument for 13 years.  The current Minister signed it - perhaps not knowing about the consequences or perhaps he wanted to sign it - and it did huge damage to the rural hauliers.  They were trying to haul milk, corn, grain or whatever.  The axle was vital.  It was put down and held.  They had to handle the cost of that.  Many had to get rid of their lorries, which they had only bought new.  That had a huge impact.  There was no impact assessment or rural-proofing of the legislation.  These trucks can travel on the motorways all they like but not on rural roads.  I know the argument is made that rural roads are damaged by the weight of these lorries but the more axles they have, the less damage will be done.  The Minister signed that statutory instrument.<\/p> <p> I commend the Minister on the recent matter of tractors travelling above a speed of 40 km\/h.  Again, the Road Safety Authority was involved in this regard.  The relevant instrument was signed in the middle of the consultation.  There was consultation with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, and other organisations and indeed the Association of Farm Contractors Ireland.  They were all coming to a follow-on consultation meeting in Kildare one afternoon and discovered when they arrived that the Minister had signed the statutory instrument.  I brought this to the Minister's attention and, to his credit, he said that the matter would have to be renegotiated because it would have a huge impact.  The farcical part about it was that tractors travelling at 40 km\/h or above were going to be put off the road.  Such vehicles could not travel at just 15 km\/h.  Where I live, one could not get from Dungarvan to the mart or to Castlemartyr.  If one got a tractor that was 20 years old and had the lowest box, it could be very defective but one could drive at 100 mph if one liked.  This is the kind of crazy thinking that goes on in the Road Safety Authority.<\/p> <p> I know a wonderful young man, Jason Maher, from Cahir in County Tipperary, who is a good entrepreneur with a great brain.  The Minister spoke to him.  Mr. Maher is passionate about a tyre application.  Half the cars in the country, unknown to us, have tyres that are below the approved grip level.  Many of the tyres on vehicles in the car park outside the House might be below the approved grip.  How are we supposed to know?   This young man when to great expense and offered great expertise and advice and the Minister's Department organised a meeting with the head of the Road Safety Authority.  He closed his premises early one Sunday night, drove to Sligo and stayed at a bed and breakfast establishment in order to be at the meeting with the boss of the Road Safety Authority.  He turned up but the man from the authority never did.  That is the contempt the authority has for new initiatives on road safety.  This tyre application would inform a register and people would get a text when the tyres on their vehicles had a certain amount of miles done or were unsafe.  In this inclement weather, one needs good new tyres.  This is the kind of contempt the Road Safety Authority shows.  It has too much power and is not policing where it should be policing.  I am saying that honestly and fairly.<\/p> <p> I have a certain amount of contempt for many of these quangos.  We had the National Roads Authority, NRA.  One could not talk to it.  We have experience of being on county councils where we want to get a sign moved or something else done on a national or primary road.  I have said many times that we had a peace process.  The late Alec Reid and a former colleague here, Martin Mansergh, were a great assistance with it.  We got rid of the IRA and we got the NRA.  That was fearful.  Thank God the authority is not into violent acts but it is destroying economies and not listening to anybody.  The young man to whom I refer travelled to Sligo with his initiative and had to go home again because a person did not bother to go and meet him.  That is where matters stand.  His application was excellent.  We have many issues with our roads besides what we are talking about and that tyre application is one solution.<\/p> <p> I want to salute An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding its work in Tipperary, Dublin and throughout the country and in Dublin.  In particular, I salute the traffic corps.  The numbers in the corps have sadly been diminished despite the work it has done.  We are spending a fortune on Gatso vans, the speed vans that we have, the operators of which have refused my request to the Minister's Department and from county councils to come to places in Dublin and Tipperary where multiple fatalities have taken place in order to try to do something with the traffic there and to test people if they are driving at reckless speeds.  They will not do so and instead want to go to places where they make money.  This is a money-making racket.  I want that crowd to be disbanded and the money to be put into the traffic corps.  Augment the traffic corps, give it a larger fleet and more members.  In a reply to parliamentary questions I tabled in 2016, I found that the State had paid almost &euro;88 million to private speed cameras firms and collected just &euro;32.7 million from motorists' fines.  That represents many people being caught and fined.  It is a trick, really.  One could be travelling in a place with an 80 km\/h limit, which suddenly drops to 60 km\/h and then, almost immediately, to 50 km\/h.  I do not drive fast.  I am not saying that I never broke the speed limit but I do not drive fast.  Any of us could get caught in an area where the limit suddenly drops to 50 km\/h.  There are places where there are three different speed limits in 200 yds or less.  A total of &euro;88 million was paid out for a return of &euro;32 million.  That is not very profitable, although the quango does all right.<\/p> <p> I am questioning the costs of operating the Garda safety camera contract because each year from 2012 to 2015 it cost the State over &euro;17 million to maintain that contract.  These are the kinds of lucrative contracts we have signed up to, such as the toll bridges.  There is no cop on.  Many of us here are in business and if we signed any kind of contract such as that, we would quickly be out of business.  The waste is shameful and outrageous.  We will go home to talk to people tomorrow evening.  I resent the fact that this Bill is down to be debated tomorrow, Thursday, evening for three and a half hours.  Those of us from rural Ireland, whether north, south, east, or west, all know that if one is not out of this city by 3 p.m., one should forget about it until 7 p.m. since this is where all the logjams occur.  One can get jammed in not too far away from here because there is an attempt to widen a motorway which was designed incorrectly 25 years ago and which does not have a sufficient number of intersections.  Where is the accountability for that and the millions that were spent?  What about the money coming in from National Toll Roads Limited and where is it going?  Is it being ploughed back into the system?  It is not.  It is all privatised in shameful deals.  We have regulators for this, that and the other.<\/p> <p> In the last three years here, we could not walk for all the investment.  The new Luas is open now and I notice the Minister did not get the opportunity to open it.  Our &euro;5 million whizz-kid, the Taoiseach, took the job of announcing that one day with his PR machine.  It was &euro;6 million or &euro;5 million.  I am not anti-Dublin at all but in the context of investment in Dublin, anything goes.  Only three transport infrastructural projects were announced in the most recent budget and they were all in Dublin.  One goes a little into Kildare but it would not be any good to the Ceann Comhairle going home because it does not go that far.  It is all Dublin-centric.  We are doing this to the detriment of rural Ireland.  I have travelled on the Luas, with all its investments, and it is a great system, but then we got congestion and bedlam and nobody could go anywhere.  The Taoiseach and his entourage were caught up in it.  These people are not the experts that they think they are at all.<\/p> <p> The Minister has done nothing to deal with the emissions targets.  I will not say what I was going to say, but he has done nothing.  There is an insurance scandal and the Minister has a bee in his bonnet.  The last men who had that were the former Minister, Noel Dempsey, and Gay Byrne.  They were going to lock up every learner driver, or their parents, if they were caught alone on the road.  I have to be honest and say that some learner drivers I knew travelled unaccompanied.  I am all for putting a penalty on it, putting a speed restriction on them or dealing with some of these absolutely awful drivers.  How are people going to educate their children and send them to college?  We cannot just drop them to the Luas, the DART or a bus station.  We do not have those in rural Ireland.  How are young people going to travel to work?  We are trying to regrow our economy and restart it, and to educate our young people.  How are they going to get to work?  They have to have a car.  I bought a car for &euro;1,500 for my 17 year old last August.  He is 18 now and the car is parked up.  I got a lovely car, formerly owned by a lady driver, but I could not get insurance since it was &euro;4,800.  Where is one going to go?  There is a racket and scandal going on in insurance, such as the Minister was able to write over the decades.  I admire much of what he put in his columns over the decades - he could do everything.  I support the Minister's legislation on judges and what he was doing with the Judiciary, but we expected so much from him.  The people of rural Ireland have been badly let down.<\/p> <p> In saying that, I want to thank the Minister for coming down to projects in Tipperary and trying to help out with issues-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700063#RRR00400","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516221300,"counter":515,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1516221300,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I did not laugh at Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700064#SSS00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1516221300,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I ought to have brought my glasses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700064#SSS00400","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1516221300,"counter":518,"content":"<p>The Deputy's mother is from Tipperary and he is laughing at Tipperary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700064#SSS00500","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1516221300,"counter":519,"content":"<p>Genuinely-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700064#SSS00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516221300,"counter":520,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1516221300,"counter":521,"content":"<p>Can I have the protection of the Chair?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700064#SSS00800","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1516221300,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700064#SSS00900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516221300,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I give credit where credit is due, and always would but these issues are sadly lacking and the Road Safety Authority is not doing what it should be doing, nor are many other quangos.

With the diminishing number of priests in our diocese and in other dioceses around us, there are not enough priests to say multiple masses.<\/p>  <p> I was responsible for setting up Ring a Link, which has done Trojan work for rural transport.  We had a launch a year after it started and we had letters from people who said it was like opening the gates of Mountjoy and being released.  These people in rural Ireland have no access to any transport.  Even if they could afford a taxi, there is none available.  I could not get a taxi in many towns in Tipperary at the weekend because the drivers will only do short runs, and they cannot be blamed for that.  They do not work on Sunday or Monday nights because the business is not there.  The Minister could do an awful lot and he should look at this area.<\/p>  <p>  The night I drove him around the scenic Glen of Aherlow, I showed him all the pubs that have closed in the past ten years from the Lady Gregory to the Silver Sands to the Cosy Kitchen to the Foot Bar to the Caravansary to the Glen Hotel and back to O'Heney's in Bansha.  These business people were paying rates and employing staff.  This is a huge attack on rural Ireland.  The pub was the centre of activity, and not just for drinkers.  I know many people who go to the pub and who do not drink at all.  It is a social occasion and they have meetings, funeral afters and so on.  A number of us in the Rural Independent Group will press the question to a vote later and we will table amendments on Committee Stage to go back to the drawing board with the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to please look at road blocks.  I did not even mention Galway where one cannot get from one side of the city to the other.  Deputy Eamon Scanlon referred to the N4 and the blockages over the years.  The congestion in Dublin causes a great deal of frustration for businesses and motorists as they try to drive from A to B.  There is a huge volume of work to be done.  I ask the Minister to go back to the drawing board and work with us.  I resent the fact that he said we are working at the behest of the vintners.  I am not raising these issues at the behest of any vintner and I do not have a vested interest.  I do not have a pub, I never owned a pub and I do not ever intend to have a pub, but I frequent many of them for clinics and social activities and they are all run by business people whom I want to support.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister should ensure a level playing field.  Drug testing should be rolled out because the effects of drug taking are much more serious but Deputy Harty could explain that better.<\/p>  <p>  The final issue I would like to raise relates to the waterways.  I raised the issue of two young men from Golden in Tipperary who lost their lives off Helvick Bay a few years ago.  There is no policing on the waterways.  People are driving all kinds of vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700065#TTT00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1516221900,"counter":531,"content":"<p>The time has expired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700065#TTT00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516221900,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I am only 30 seconds over.

In some cases, they were extremely constructive.  The debate has been marked this evening by a lack of willingness to address the issue and a complete lack of recognition of the fact that the Bill is about one thing and one thing only, which is saving lives.  It is not about Garda enforcement, speeding, mobile telephones or other issues that have been raised; it is about saving lives.  Deputy O'Broin opened this evening's debate on a sombre but relevant note when he said that he did not know how many lives this measure will save, and nor do I, but he also said that he was sure that it would save some.  I do not know, but then nobody does.  There has to be a recognition, which has been notably absent from this debate, that alcohol is a dangerous substance to be carrying in one's body when one is driving a car.  Apart from the contributions of Deputies O'Broin, Harty and Grealish, the debate has been notable for the fact that there has been no suggestion by any Member of a solution to the problem of alcohol and driving.  The debate is being used as a platform for coming up with all the ills affecting certain parts of Ireland but without any solutions to the issue that the Bill addresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700065#TTT01200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1516221900,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Rural proofing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700065#TTT01300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1516221900,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I will yield to no one in the attention I have given to rural Ireland since I came into the Department.

I would like to thank those who have supported this very important proposal to strengthen the law on drink-driving.  I know there are those who still argue against what I am proposing.  I believe I have already explained, when I introduced this Bill, why it is important, why it is necessary and how it will save lives.<\/p>  <p>  There have been many contributions to this debate and I am pleased to see the interest the Bill has attracted.  I would like to address the matters raised in the course of the debate and I apologise if I do not individually name each of the many contributors, in particular as some of the contributions are particularly sensitive.  I am pleased to hear from Deputy Troy and his party colleagues that they intend to support my proposals to amend last year's legislation on unaccompanied drivers.  I would like to thank Deputy Troy for his support on this matter.  On this topic, Deputy Broughan asked whether I have in mind one amendment or two.  The answer is two, one to correct the provision brought up in 2016 so it can be commenced and one to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to detain vehicles driven by unaccompanied learner drivers.<\/p>  <p>  I am sorry that Deputy Troy and his colleagues cannot see their way to supporting the core proposal of this Bill in regard to drink-driving.  As Deputy Troy said, his party brought in the drink-driving legislation in this country.  We agree on the great value of most of that legislation.  Where we disagree is on one important aspect, namely, the fact it allows some people who drink and drive to receive penalty points when they should, I am convinced, received a disqualification.  Deputies Troy and Cahill noted quite correctly that this Bill relates to people found to be in the 50 mg to 80 mg alcohol bracket and they asked what I am proposing in regard to people on higher brackets.  I take the view that their party has already provided in the existing legislation the appropriate penalties, including disqualification, in the higher brackets.<\/p>  <p>  Some Deputies have suggested that the evidence I have cited underpinning this Bill is out of date.  Yes, I did quote some figures from 2008-12 but I also referred in my opening speech to the 3,003 fixed penalty notices issued to drink drivers in the 51 mg to 80 mg alcohol concentration bracket from 2012 to 2016, inclusive, and to the striking increase in the numbers during 2016.  This disturbing trend has continued and in April 2017 there were more arrests for drink-driving than in any single month in the past five years.  I might note too that in 2017, which was overall a year of declining deaths on our roads, there was an increase in both deaths and drink-driving detections in Kerry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700066#UUU00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1516222500,"counter":553,"content":"<p>He is personalising it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700066#UUU00300","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1516222500,"counter":554,"content":"<p>The issue of people not returning their driving licences when they are disqualified was raised by Deputies Broughan, Eugene Murphy and Troy.  Drivers who are disqualified are required by law to return their licences and the fact that very few do is completely unacceptable.  However, the real problem is not disqualified drivers failing to return their licences; it is disqualified drivers who continue to drive.  The number of disqualified drivers not returning their licences is not a proxy for the number of people who drive while disqualified.  We need strong enforcement of the law against people driving while disqualified, and the necessary tools exist in the Road Traffic Act 2014, which empowered An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to arrest a person who they have reason to believe is driving while disqualified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700066#UUU00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516222500,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1516222500,"counter":556,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 18 January 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700066#UUU00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Report of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution: Statements (Resumed)","time":1516222500,"counter":557,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700066#UUU00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1516222500,"counter":558,"content":"<p>This is my second time to speak and I believe I will have another opportunity tomorrow, which is to be welcomed.  When I spoke earlier, I read out an email that was sent to me by the parents of a young woman who has Down syndrome.  I note the reaction to that on social media from groups that would style themselves as being pro-life, which is very disappointing.  We in this Chamber have an obligation to lead by example when it comes to the tone of the debate regarding the eighth amendment.  I think that, for the next couple of months, I might just stay away from social media.<\/p><p>When people can be anonymous and hide behind faceless accounts, they sometimes engage in trolling.  We should not allow that to deter us from the respectful and important debate that we must have.<\/p> <p> I commend the committee's Chair and all of its members.  Many have referred to being on a journey.  They can say that because they listened and did not go to the committee with closed minds.  Instead, they approached the evidence with open minds.<\/p> <p> I thank the members of the Citizens' Assembly, who gave freely of their time.  Were I to be asked, I am not sure that I would put my name forward in similar circumstances.  Not that Malahide is not beautiful.  Of course it is, but I do not believe I would want to spend my weekends there discussing the issues that the assembly has tackled.  Its members did us a service.  They heard a great deal of evidence.  I was fortunate enough to have the time to attend a few of their debates, but that I was able to follow online was helpful.  When the committee came to discuss this, a large amount of work had already been done for us.  That is not to say that we did not do our own work - we did - or that we were not diligent and attentive in that work, but we were also mindful of the fact that the Citizens' Assembly had put a considerable amount of information into the public domain and had shared it with us.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, the committee had to hear some difficult evidence.  Other Deputies referred to the evidence given by the group Termination for Medical Reasons Ireland.  Perhaps some of my colleagues would like to say that they had a bit of dust in their eyes, but by the time that Ms Claire Cullen-Delsol and Mr. Gerry Edwards had finished telling us not just their own personal stories, which were touching, but also the stories of their group's members, there was not a dry eye among members.  It was emotional.  We were all a little embarrassed and reminded of the fact that the UN had characterised the treatment of Ms Amanda Mellet as cruel, inhumane and degrading.  Those who stayed for that debate and listened with an open mind to what was said left the committee room that night resolved that, even if we did nothing else, we would not continue to put women and their families through this cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment.<\/p> <p> For that to happen and for us as a people to be able to make that decision, we need to repeal the eighth amendment.  There will be much repetition in the House in the next couple of weeks.  When we start talking, we will return to the inevitability of the Oireachtas having to tackle the issue of the eighth amendment.  When the master of the Rotunda Hospital says in no uncertain terms and in an unbiased way that, as a medical professional, the eighth amendment prevents him from delivering the full range of health care to the women in his care, we must take notice.  We cannot ignore our medical professionals telling us that there is something in our Constitution that prevents them from delivering a full range of care to women.  If we ignore them and say that we as a House and a people are happy that that man and his team cannot deliver those services, then we are telling women that their service will be second class and that they are second rate citizens.  That is not what I am hearing in this debate.  I am hearing people who want to put women first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700066#UUU00800","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516223100,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt, but I must ask the Deputy to move the Adjournment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700067#VVV00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516223100,"counter":561,"content":"<p>It will be third time lucky for Deputy O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700067#VVV00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1516223100,"counter":562,"content":"<p>Eventually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700067#VVV00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516223100,"counter":563,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 January 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
