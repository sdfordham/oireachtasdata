Under the Plan the public transport programme\u00a0will reach\u00a0&euro;3.6bn to include new and replacement buses, completion of the Luas Cross City project and the reopening of the Phoenix Park tunnel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100068#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Infrastructure","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100068#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[39249\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100068#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the transport improvements planned for County Donegal over the next ten years; if these plans will address areas along the Wild Atlantic Way in view of increasing tourist numbers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>\u200bAs part of the Capital Plan a roads programme totalling &euro;6bn is now proposed over the period 2016-2022.\u00a0\u00a0This plan was framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.

This is a key step in returning capital to the taxpayer, in recognition of the significant investment made in the bank during the financial crisis, while it also regularises the bank's capital structure making it compliant with new regulatory requirements.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to future returns, the State's &euro;3.5 billion of preference shares delivered a cash dividend of &euro;280m earlier this\u00a0year and a further payment of accrued dividend will be made on conversion\/redemption of the shares in the coming months to reflect the dividend outstanding at that time.<\/p>  <p>  Next year, the Contingent Capital Notes, or \"CoCos\", which were issued by the State to AIB in July 2011 are due to mature.

","asker":"1034","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) is the overall title for both Gift and Inheritance Tax.  The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. <\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e.the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the \"Group threshold\" below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.  There is also an annual small gifts exemption of &euro;3,000.<\/p>  <p>  The details supplied describe a situation in which two siblings have inherited a house jointly from their mother.  Based on the date of death of the disponer, this means that a tax-free threshold of &euro;225,000 applies to each inheritor.  If neither of them had previously received gifts or inheritances from a parent beyond the annual small gifts amount this means that, between them, they would be entitled to receive &euro;450,000 tax-free before the application of CAT, on the basis that neither of them is eligible for the dwelling house exemption which applies in many cases where an individual inherits the property in which they live.<\/p>  <p>  The dwelling house exemption allows an individual to inherit the property in which they live free of CAT, subject to certain conditions.  One of these is that the individual has no beneficial interest in another residential property.  The reason for this is that the exemption is designed to prevent hardship in cases where individuals are sharing a home and where one or more individuals are bequeathed the home in circumstances where they would otherwise have to sell the property in order to pay a CAT liability and be left without a home.  This situation does not arise when an inheritor also owns other residential property or properties.  I have no plans to modify the requirements of the dwelling house exemption to remove this condition.  The core principle that the exemption is designed to prevent hardship in the case of home sharers is not satisfied where an individual owns other residential property. <\/p>  <p>  Concern is raised in the details supplied regarding the ability to pay the tax.  In this regard, an inheritor of land or buildings is entitled to pay any inheritance tax due by instalments over a period of five years, subject to interest.  The Revenue Commissioners also have the discretion to allow payment over a longer period, delayed payment and\/or the waiving of interest in cases of genuine hardship.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2016, I raised the Group A threshold applying to gifts and inheritances from parents to their children from &euro;225,000 to &euro;280,000. This represents an increase of about 25%.  I did this in recognition of the improving state of the national finances and of the concerns expressed to me by people making and receiving gifts and inheritances, particularly in a context of rising property prices.  The scale of the increase may not be considered sufficient by some but it is a significant change and as much as could be afforded at this time.  I have, however, indicated that I see the change to the Group A tax- free threshold in this year's Budget as the start of a process.  Provided, among other factors, that our economic recovery continues, I will examine the scope for further improvements in the tax-free thresholds in the future<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100075#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Submissions","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100075#WRJ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[39747\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100075#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the groups or persons he, or his officials, have met to discuss budget 2016 and the Finance Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This is at the heart of the Action Plan for Jobs process and has been a central feature of successive Budgets and The Pathways to Work programme.  This level of policy focus has helped create an environment where 126,000 extra people are at work, all regions are increasing employment and our economy is the fastest growing in the EU.  In the context of the above enterprise and jobs performance it should be noted that one of the first decisions this Government made was to reverse the &euro;1 cut in the national minimum wage implemented by the previous Government.  In the context of the minimum wage, the report from the Low Pay Commission which supported the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations regarding the appropriate rate for the National Minimum Wage (NMW) stated that research indicates that moderate increases in the NMW are unlikely to have a significantly adverse effect on employment.<\/p><p>The Commission recommended that anomalies in relation to PRSI which could adversely affect employer costs should be addressed, and I believe that the adjustments to PRSI which have been provided for by my colleague, Minister Noonan, in the recent Budget, will assist employers in reducing costs, thus ensuring a continuing positive climate for job creation.<\/p><p>Budget Documentation available at the following link gives the example (Example 6 page B.22) of an individual earning the minimum wage of &euro;8.65 for a 39 hour week in 2015. The minimum wage increase will mean an additional &euro;1,014 per annum for this person, taking their gross income to &euro;18,556 in 2016. Their income tax liability will increase from &euro;208 per annum to &euro;411 per annum due to their additional earnings. They will have a PRSI liability of &euro;160. USC liability reduces from &euro;374 to &euro;317. The net gain for this person is &euro;708 per annum or 4.2%.<\/p><p>Due to the budget changes introduced the employer will pay PRSI at 8.5% and not move to the previously higher rate of 10.75% when paying the additional &euro;1,014 per annum. This reduces the additional PRSI paid by an employer to &euro;86.19 per annum.<\/p><p>PRSI changes (New PRSI relief of &euro;12 per week for employees and increase in employer threshold)<\/p><p>Application where someone earns the new NMW of &euro;9.15 per hour (39 hour week = &euro;18,556 per annum)<\/p><p>The maximum PRSI relief is &euro;12 a week, applied on wages of &euro;352 a week. So instead of paying &euro;14.08 a week PRSI the person will pay &euro;2.08 a week.<\/p><p>The PRSI relief is gradually reduced as wages rise to &euro;424 a week - for every &euro;12 rise in weekly wage the relief is reduced by &euro;2.<table><tr><th>Weekly wage<\/th><th>Hourly rate<\/th><th>Old PRSI<\/th><th>Relief<\/th><th>New PRSI<\/th><th>Old Annual PRSI<\/th><th>New Annual PRSI<\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>352.00<\/td><td>9.03<\/td><td>14.08<\/td><td>12.00<\/td><td>2.08<\/td><td>732.16<\/td><td>108.16<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>356.85<\/td><td>9.15<\/td><td>14.27<\/td><td>11.19<\/td><td>3.08<\/td><td>742.04<\/td><td>160.16<\/td><td>NMW<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>364.00<\/td><td>9.33<\/td><td>14.56<\/td><td>10.00<\/td><td>4.56<\/td><td>757.12<\/td><td>237.12<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>376.00<\/td><td>9.64<\/td><td>15.04<\/td><td>8.00<\/td><td>7.04<\/td><td>782.08<\/td><td>366.08<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>388.00<\/td><td>9.95<\/td><td>15.52<\/td><td>6.00<\/td><td>9.52<\/td><td>807.04<\/td><td>495.04<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>400.00<\/td><td>10.26<\/td><td>16.00<\/td><td>4.00<\/td><td>12.00<\/td><td>832.00<\/td><td>624.00<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>412.00<\/td><td>10.56<\/td><td>16.48<\/td><td>2.00<\/td><td>14.48<\/td><td>856.96<\/td><td>752.96<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>424.00<\/td><td>10.87<\/td><td>16.96<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>16.96<\/td><td>881.92<\/td><td>881.92<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><\/table>Annual PRSI Cost to Employee on new NMW (working 39 hours p.w.) without the proposed change would be &euro;742.04 (&euro;18,556 * 4%), giving a saving of &euro;581.88 even with the new payment of &euro;160.<\/p><p>Employer impact - increase in threshold for change of rate from 8.5% to 10.75% from &euro;356.01 to &euro;376.01<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Weekly NMW<\/th><th>PRSI rate<\/th><th>Weekly cost<\/th><th>No of weeks<\/th><th>Annual Cost<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Increase of rate to &euro;376 before 10.75% applies<\/td><td>356.85<\/td><td>8.50%<\/td><td>30.33<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>1,577.28<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cost to employer prior to Budget change  <\/td><td>356.85<\/td><td>10.75%<\/td><td>38.36<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>1,994.79<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Difference<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>8.03<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>417.51<\/td><\/tr><\/table>Annual PRSI Cost to Employer without the proposed change would be &euro;1,994.79, giving a saving of &euro;417.51.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p><p><sup>1.<\/sup>(There is an additional saving to Employer also for employees earning up to &euro;9.64 per hour\/&euro;376 p.w., who previously would have invoked the 10.75% rate - annual saving to the employer of &euro;439.92 for an employee earning &euro;376 per week).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100076#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1067"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100076#WRK01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Safety","counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100076#WRK01150"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[39637\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100076#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"to set out his plans to extend the registration date beyond 26 November 2015 for farmers to register as professional users of pesticides, given that a number of farmers may not have completed an approved pesticide course by the deadline due to illness or the unavailability of space on a locally-organised course; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>The Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive establishes a framework for European Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides by setting minimum rules to reduce the risks to human health and the environment that are associated with pesticide use.

The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.<\/p><p>These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a Constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of <i>State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976]I.R. 325<\/i>effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a Constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that &quot;<i>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require&quot;. <\/i>As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.<\/p><p>I can inform the Deputy that a new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is currently being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Legislative provisions under consideration include provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, enable the Board to verify the means of applicants and to provide for prosecution of cases of abuse.<\/p><p>In respect of sentencing, the legislature generally sets out the maximum sentence that can be imposed and it is then a matter for the judiciary to decide what is the appropriate sentence in a particular case taking into account all the circumstances.  There is however, a mandatory sentence for murder and presumptive minimum sentences for a number of offences.<\/p><p>The Law Reform Commission looked at the issue of mandatory sentences in detail in their report LRC108-2013.  They were in favour of retaining the mandatory sentence for murder.  However they were of the view that for other offences, mandatory sentencing regimes are too rigid and have not been shown to be effective in reducing offending.  They recommended that presumptive minimum sentences should not be extended and that existing provisions should be repealed.<\/p><p>The Strategic Review of Penal Policy report published in July 2014 made a number of recommendations about sentencing.  In particular they recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences be introduced and existing provisions should be reviewed.<\/p><p>I am looking at the question of sentencing legislation in the light of these two reports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100082#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Complaints Procedures","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100082#WRQ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[39709\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100082#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views regarding the prisoner complaints procedure which was introduced in June 2014, and the audit and evaluation which is currently being conducted by the Inspector of Prisons; when it will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>A new comprehensive prisoner complaints system was introduced in the Irish Prison Service in November 2012 based on a model recommended by the Inspector of Prisons who has independent oversight of the process.  The intention was to have robust procedures in place which would give prisoners access to a credible complaints system that deals with genuine complaints in an open, transparent and independent way.<\/p>  <p>  The system is categorised depending on the nature of the complaint.  Category A complaints concern the most serious level of complaint (assault, serious intimidation by staff etc.).  Category B complaints include allegations of discrimination, verbal abuse by officers and inappropriate searches.  Category C complaints are essentially service complaints where a prisoner is unhappy with the level of service in a particular prison.  Category D complaints are those alleging misconduct or mistreatment by professionals providing services to prisoners such as doctors, dentists etc.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2013 the then Minister announced amendments to the Prison Rules to support and give effect to the new procedures for the investigation of prisoner complaints.  In the main, the amendments to the Prison Rules provide that prisoner complaints under Category A will be examined by investigators from outside the Prison Service to ensure an effective and impartial investigation.  The complainant will be kept informed and the reports by outside investigators are automatically submitted to the Governor in question, the Director General and the Inspector of Prisons.

(1) of the Constitution allows for the establishment of special courts in accordance with the law in cases where it is considered that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice.  Section 38 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 provides for the establishment of Special Criminal Courts.  Section 38 of the 1939 Act as amended also provides that the Government may, whenever they consider it necessary or desirable to do so, establish additional Special Criminal Courts as they think fit.  It also provides that whenever two or more Special Criminal Courts are in existence the Government may, if and so often as they think fit, reduce the number of such Courts and abolish those existing Courts that appear to be redundant.<\/p>  <p>  There is a backlog of cases in the existing Special Criminal Court with delays of approximately twenty months in cases coming to trial.

This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 qualified for free pre-school from September 2015. Children whose third birthday is on or after 1 July 2012 are below the age range for eligibility for ECCE in the 2015\/2016 programme year but will qualify for the 2016\/17 programme year. <\/p>  <p>  The recent Budget decisions, which introduced an extended provision under the ECCE programme that allows children to access the free pre-school programme from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school, come into effect from September 2016. This extended provision, when fully rolled out, will mean that children will have access to free education - either in pre-school or primary school - from the age of three.  The start up date for the introduction of this new measure was decided so as to allow pre-school providers an adequate timeframe to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional numbers benefiting from the programme, which is estimated to increase from 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that, depending on their date of birth, some children enrolling in the ECCE programme in September 2016 will not benefit from this extended free pre-school provision. I am also aware that, when the programme is fully in place (i.e. from 2017), there will be some children who will benefit for a shorter extra period of free pre-school than others. Again, this will depend on the child's date of birth and the age at which they make the transition to primary school. Ultimately however, when this extended programme is fully in place, all children will be better off than in the present programme. Indeed, the net effect of the improvements for children overall will be an increase of an average of 23 weeks over the current programme.  I think that this is a significant step forward for children and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100083#WRR00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100083#WRR00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100083#WRR00550"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[39636\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100083#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an application for a medical card by persons (details supplied) in County Kilkenny.","asker":"1199","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

For example, a number of my Department&rsquo;s programmes are delivered through agencies and other intermediary bodies that operate across county boundaries and in respect of which there is no detailed breakdown on a county basis held by my Department.  Groups and organisations that receive grants directly from my Department are not typically constituted on a single-county basis.<\/p><p>In view of this and because of the wide range of my Department&rsquo;s schemes and programmes, and the large volumes of payments and grants involved, it is not possible to provide the information sought.  However, if the Deputy has specific queries relating to a particular programme or grant, I will endeavour to provide him with relevant information in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100094#WRCC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Labour Activation Measures","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100094#WRCC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[39683\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111100094#WRCC01200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if her Department is availing of the JobsBridge scheme; if so, the number of personnel recruited, and the type of duties being undertaken; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
