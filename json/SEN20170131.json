Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh, for selecting this matter for discussion.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, a lady for whom I have enormous regard.  I wish her well in her portfolio.  She is already doing a great job.  It is a difficult portfolio but it gives me great pleasure in the Seanad to acknowledge and salute the work she is doing.<\/p> <p>I tabled this matter because I firmly believe the set-up with coroners in this country must be reviewed and updated.  It is fair to say the coroners legislation governing the operation of all the coroners in this country is outdated and badly needs to be upgraded.  Certainly, in light of recent issues that have been raised in our hospitals, particularly when it comes to newborn babies dying or being found dead, a coroner's inquiry should be mandatory in all those cases.  We have seen scandalous examples in a tiny minority of hospitals where mothers and their babies have died and it is totally unacceptable for there to be no inquiry.  It should be mandatory to have a coroner's inquest into all maternal deaths.<\/p> <p>Having the Coroners Service under the auspices of local authorities does not make sense in the modern era.  I know the Department of Justice and Equality is the lead agency, but in all local cases, the corners are paid for by the local authority and that comes from local authority budgets.  Many Senators regularly get correspondence from local authorities seeking additional funding for various services.  In fairness to all the local authorities, they have made great strides in reducing cost, cutting waste and so forth.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The cost over which they have no control is that relating to coroners.  They receive a coroner's bill every year and must pay it.  They cannot question it, negotiate a reduction or seek value for money.  They never know whether the bill will be large or small.  Therefore, it is difficult for councils and finance officers in local authorities to budget for the expense.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, there have been many tragedies in my county, Clare, and in many other counties with coastlines.  In fact, the services of coroners are required a great deal more than we would like.  For the sake of all citizens of this country, and in the interest of the profession of coroners, we need the long promised legislation to be delivered as a matter of urgency.  This is one particular statute and set-up that badly needs to be brought into the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#B00400","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485873000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his statement.  On behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, who cannot be here today, I thank him for raising this subject that affords an opportunity to update the House of the most recent developments.  I acknowledge his active involvement in promoting reform of the system in which the coroners operate.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway, along with other members of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, met officials from the T&aacute;naiste's Department on 23 November 2016 to continue engagement on this matter.  The officials updated the committee on the extensive work that has already undertaken on the legal and medical aspects of the comprehensive review of the Coroners Bill 2007 directed by the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste has now established a dedicated coroner unit in her Department.  The unit will develop policy and contribute to the review of the legislative provisions with the clear mandate to do what needs to be done to bring about reform as soon as is practical.  The unit became operational at the beginning of this month.  It has started engagement with relevant stakeholders and a review of the latest developments in coroner organisations in similar states with a common law heritage.<\/p> <p>The critical issue is that any proposals brought forward to the Oireachtas to move to a modern coroner system must be coherent and cost-effective.  Most importantly, our new coronial law and service must meet our obligations to the people of this State and also those obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p> <p>The Coroners Bill 2007 was a significant attempt to bring about modernisation of both the law and practice of the coroner's investigation and the nature and role of the office of coroner itself.  Responsibility would be transferred from local authorities to the Minister for Justice and Equality, with a new post of chief coroner, full-time coroners and a new central coroner service to provide enhanced support to coroners and to liaise with bereaved families.  To operate the intensive requirements for improved coroner death investigation services, as set out in the 2007 Bill, and allowing for developments since, we must examine and decide on an appropriate delivery system.  The new coroner unit will have to urgently consider whether the full-time model proposed in 2007 is still the optimum approach.  This would end the current part-time coronial service, provided by either lawyers or doctors, in jurisdictions based on county or sub-county divisions.  Such an approach has already been taken in the modernised coroner services of Northern Ireland and New Zealand.  Those States also operate a lawyer-only coroner model.<\/p> <p>While not the focus of today's discussion, I should mention the recent proposals to amend the law with regard to making certain deaths subject to mandatory inquests and to add to the range of permissible inquest verdicts put forward by Deputy Clare Daly and Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, respectively, in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Their proposals will be integrated into the review being conducted by the coroner unit in the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#C00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1485873000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her positive and comprehensive reply.

The hostel closed in 2010 and in 2011 the Employment Appeals Tribunal determined that a genuine redundancy existed.  As a result, SIPTU made a direct application to the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the payment of statutory entitlements through the Social Insurance Fund.  It took the workers approximately 14 months, through their union, to receive these payments.  SIPTU then progressed a claim for enhanced redundancy in line with previous agreements of the Labour Court, which issued its findings on 16 March 2016.

What message does it send that the Department of Social Protection did not even bother to tell SIPTU that it had chosen to pass on this issue to another Department, if that is what has happened?  What about the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, which has been waiting for a response for five months on whether the Government will attend the hearing to resolve the related matter of the breach of the community employment supervisor enhanced redundancy agreements?  Will the Minister of State at least confirm that the Government will accept the WRC's invitation to talks?  Is she even aware that the invitation has been outstanding for the past five months?  We have Ireland's largest union waiting for a response that has not come.  We also have the Workplace Relations Commission waiting for a response.

I will read the statement I have been given.  I have taken note of what the Senator has said which I will relay back to the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>The Tipperary hostel project was a community based project set up in 2000 by Tipperary Hostel Limited.  Its objective was the transformation of a Famine era workhouse in Tipperary Town into a facility which was expected to operate primarily as a local community based hostel under community and voluntary management.  The project was part funded under a F&Aacute;S job initiative programme.  F&Aacute;S provided financial support to assist with the job intervention programme, for example, with participants' wages.  Funding was also provided for the project by Pobal.  The aim of the job initiative programme was to assist long-term unemployed persons to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities. <\/p> <p>In April 2010 the board of Tipperary Hostel Limited informed F&Aacute;S that it would be ceasing work on the project on 30 April 2010.  This followed on from an internal audit investigation by both Pobal and F&Aacute;S.  At the time of the closure there were 22 employees participating in the scheme.  F&Aacute;S arranged alternative employment on community schemes for 22 participants, however only one availed of this offer.  <\/p> <p>A case on behalf of the employees was taken to the Employment Appeals Tribunal where it was established that the employer of the job initiative programme participants was Tipperary Hostel Limited, not F&Aacute;S.  F&Aacute;S ceased to fund and manage all job initiative schemes in 2011 as this function was transferred to the Department of Social Protection.  In October 2013 F&Aacute;S was abolished and SOLAS was established.  SOLAS has no liability for redundancy payments to the former participants as its predecessor, F&Aacute;S, was never their employer as was confirmed at the Employment Appeal Tribunal.  SOLAS was not a party to the Labour Court recommendations of March 2016, LCR21162 to LCR21181, inclusive, and LCR21185.  The parties involved were Tipperary Hostel Limited and SIPTU.  In the recommendations of the Labour Court the finding was against Tipperary Hostel Limited.  Tipperary Hostel Limited stated it had no funds as during its operation it had relied on funding from F&Aacute;S and POBAL.  The Labour Court recommended that the parties, Tipperary Hostel Limited and SIPTU, jointly co-operate in seeking the necessary funds from the funding agency to discharge the amounts recommended.  Tipperary Hostel Limited and SIPTU have not at any stage sought funding from SOLAS or the Department. <\/p> <p>In relation to the decision on the provision of funding, it should also be noted that there is an outstanding liability due to SOLAS of &euro;159,960 from Tipperary Hostel Limited.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->SOLAS has continued to pursue this funding from the company.

The school principal, who is to be complimented for acting so quickly, was concerned and decided to contact a local general practitioner, who - in fairness to him - left his practice and went straight to the school.  The case was so serious that the GP decided to travel with the child in a car to Cavan General Hospital.  Surely this is not good enough in this day and age.  I am sure the Minister of State can appreciate the trauma the family went through.  Family members were worried about their loved ones and were extremely annoyed and upset about the delays that took place.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These cases join a long list of cases in counties Monaghan and Cavan that would explain similar life-threatening delays.  Unfortunately, this has been a problem in Monaghan for over a decade.  When acute hospital services were removed from Monaghan General Hospital, the people of the county were promised a beefed-up ambulance service to compensate for the lack of services at the hospital.  Unfortunately, the people of Monaghan are still waiting.<\/p><p>I wish to clarify the definition of a \"golden hour\".  It is a term people in Monaghan and Cavan are rather familiar with.  The golden hour is a period of one hour, or less, following traumatic injury being sustained by a casualty or medical emergency, during which there is the highest likelihood that prompt medical treatment will prevent death.<\/p><p>Today, there is a real and palpable fear among people in Monaghan and Cavan that a delay will occur following an ambulance call-out.  Ambulance response times in Monaghan and Cavan are well outside the recommended levels.  Indeed, the same applies in the north-east region generally, according to the latest National Ambulance Service statistics.  HIQA guidelines are clear: an ambulance should arrive at the scene of a life-threatening emergency in fewer than 19 minutes in 80% of cases.  However, last September, this target was met in only 67% of the 809 calls in the north-east region, well below the national average of 74%.<\/p><p>Last week, to great fanfare, An Taoiseach, along with senior Ministers, told us how the Government was going to look after and focus on the needs of rural Ireland.  The most basic need of any citizen in rural Ireland is access to health care.  Surely, the Minister of State will agree that the ambulance call-out consistency rate is abysmal.<\/p><p>The Minister and the HSE have much to do to establish confidence in the provision of health care in rural areas like counties Monaghan and Cavan.  In no way is any criticism today directed at front-line staff.  They are put in a difficult position and arrive at the scene where people are upset and distressed.  They deserve great praise for the professionalism shown in adverse circumstances as well as for the care and kindness they show to the people concerned and their families.  The lack of resources explains inadequate ambulance cover and delays.  Ambulances are trying to cover areas that are too extensive to be feasible within time targets.  Accountability for delays and poor service must be fixed as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>I call on the Minister of State to arrange for a commitment to be given to the people of Cavan and Monaghan to the effect that delays of this nature will not continue and that adequate resources will be put in place to ensure people are attended to when the need arises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#F01200","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485873000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this important matter, and I welcome the opportunity to address the House.<\/p> <p>Monaghan ambulance base provides a 24-7 ambulance service.

In this regard, Monaghan can also be served by resources based at Castleblayney, Cavan, Dundalk, Ardee and Virginia.<\/p> <p>While response times are helpful for performance measurement, it should be recognised that sole reliance on response times does not provide a comprehensive picture of modern ambulance service performance.<\/p> <p>A steering group set up by the HSE has been working to define a new set of key performance indicators for the ambulance service.

The national emergency operations centre has been established.  At the centre, emergency calls are received and emergency resources are dispatched.  The National Ambulance Service has visibility of all available paramedic resources and vehicles in real time, ensuring that the closest available resource is dispatched to an emergency.  In addition, the National Ambulance Service has developed the intermediate care service to provide lower acuity hospital transfers.  This frees up emergency ambulances for the more urgent calls.

Implementation of the recommendations of the capacity review will require a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology.

The Irish Government must stand behind the undocumented Irish in the United States and urgently establish a task force to make representations on their behalf.  <\/p><p>Of the numerous executive orders signed by the President, the newest anti-immigration policies scare me the most.  I am sure many of us will take a stance on them today in the House.  I formally oppose the anti-immigration, anti-refugee and anti-Muslim policies in particular of the President of the United States.  What is most disturbing and which shows a serious erosion of the rule of law is the President's sacking of Sally Yates, the US equivalent to our Attorney General, for refusing to defend the new anti-immigration policies, which include the 120-day stay on the already meagre refugee programme and the 90-day ban on entry into the USA by nationals from seven countries with majority Muslim populations.  <\/p><p>When the Taoiseach visits the White House in March, I hope he takes the opportunity, on behalf of many people who will never get a chance to meet the President, to raise the concerns of many Irish people about his immigration policies and other discriminatory policies.

I bring up their name because it is in the public domain.  They bought Westport House, one of the greatest landmarks and jewels in the crown of County Mayo to keep it alive and give it a future.  It was a national, regional and local triumph.  It is a place of great beauty, creativity and imagination for tourism, art, geography, history, music and architecture.  They, as a business family in the town, have kept this alive forever.  All the jobs are saved by their generosity and their new direction.  It was done with no rancour whatsoever.

I also congratulate Mr. Harry Hughes and Mr. Owen Hughes, Mr. Peter Hynes of Mayo County Council, the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, the Department and the Taoiseach.  Cathal Hughes - one of our own people in the west of Ireland - said he intends to put &euro;50 million into something that is our own to keep 200 jobs, to understand and articulate the importance of Westport and Mayo as a county and to ensure the house is maintained in creativity, history, beauty and imagination in perpetuity.  They are exactly the kind of generous businessmen, thinkers and educators that every county needs and has.  It took courage to do it without rancour and disturbance.  I am glad to see it.  It is a change.  It is one of our own, buying one of the great houses to keep it in perpetuity for the people of Mayo.  I wanted to put that on the record today.

They are in breach of EU and UN obligations and amount to the subversion of proper standards of decency and equality.  I am firmly of the view that this arbitrary ban is wrong and will be totally counterproductive.  It will undermine efforts to improve relations between peoples of all faiths and nationalities.  Generations of Irish people fled starvation, poverty and conflict to make a new life and contributed to the building of America.  Millions of their descendants are among the most outraged at the recent moves.  It is worth noting that many Americans are opposed to President Trump's policies.  The Irish Government should refuse to impose the ban on citizens from the seven countries in question seeking to enter the United States through the pre-clearance facilities at Dublin and Shannon airports.  We have organised a protest tomorrow at Shannon Airport on this very issue.  We need to ensure the State's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and other international agreements will be fully observed.  The question is whether the Government will take the opportunity to advise the undocumented Irish in the United States not to be alarmed by recent developments.  I know that many people are frightened.  Will the Taoiseach meet them when he is in the USA to hear from and talk to them about the issue?  The focus of his visit has to be on engaging with the diaspora, stand uping for the undocumented Irish and maintaining our strong ties with Irish America.  Will the Government indicate in the strongest possible terms the Irish people's total opposition to the racist, anti-woman and anti-immigrant policies of President Trump?  There is a big job of work to be done and we are relying on the Taoiseach to do it.

President Trump's defence is based on national security grounds, but no nationals of the relevant countries were involved in the events of 9\/11 and the central shared feature is that they are all Muslim-majority nations.  President Trump campaigned on a platform of nativism and racism, but many commentators said his radical policies would never be implemented.  However, recent events have proved them to be wholly wrong.  I am horrified that a US President believes he is justified in pursuing this course of action.  He is targeting members of one of the world's largest religions based on the actions of extremists, a religion which has 3.3 million followers in his own country.  He is absolutely failing in his duty to represent all Americans.  It is clear that we must take every opportunity available to us to oppose and resist the discriminatory policies of this President which fly in the face of the values of the Irish people and Irish society.  We value diversity which we appreciate is one of our greatest strengths.  We oppose discrimination and those who engage in the politics of division.  I support the call that the provision of US immigration per-clearance facilities be reviewed to ensure we are in full compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.  If it is discovered that we are colluding on Irish soil in imposing this discriminatory ban, I we should no longer offer the service at Irish airports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#P00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1485873000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I join others in congratulating Mr. Martin Groves on his appointment as Clerk of the Seanad.

However, his actions since then, particularly over the weekend in issuing the executive order restricting immigration, have gone further.  As others have said, this very much deserves an outright condemnation from those of us here who are concerned to ensure we do not see this sort of racial profiling and what amounts to an effective ban on Muslims in that it is a ban on citizens of many countries.<\/p><p>The executive order has implications for us in Ireland, as others have said.  If one looks today at the website of the US Embassy in Ireland, one will see a notice on the front page telling anyone who is a citizen, or indeed a dual citizen, of one of the seven countries not to apply for a visa, not to continue with a visa application process already in train and to cancel an interview if one has been granted one.  These are Irish citizens who also happen to be citizens of one of the seven countries named in the order.  This has serious implications.<\/p><p>We then saw the dismissal of Sally Yates as Attorney General by Donald Trump because she took the view that she could not be sure of the lawfulness of the executive order, in particular of its effect on those who have already been through a process and who now, it appears, will be denied entry to the US.  These are all very serious questions.  I call on the Leader to bring the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade before this House to answer a number of questions that my colleague and our party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, tabled in the D&aacute;il but which were disallowed as private notice questions today.  Deputy Howlin asked that the Taoiseach outline the circumstances which led to his request for a complete review of the operation of pre-clearance facilities, in particular that he explain whether there are possible legal implications for Ireland arising from possible complicity in the implementation by US authorities of policies that may have the effect of discrimination based on race or religion.<\/p><p>Deputy Howlin also raised the question others have raised, namely, that the new US restrictions fly in the face of international legal obligations on each state towards asylum seekers, those seeking refuge.  Therefore, I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade before this House this week to answer these questions.  I also support my party leader's call on the Taoiseach not to attend the St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the US on 17 March if these restrictions remain in place.  We all hope the US legal and democratic system is sufficiently robust.  As we have seen already, a number of judges are refusing to implement the effect of the order in respect of people who have already been through visa processes.  I hope we will see the executive order reversed or its effect repealed before St. Patrick's Day.  However, we must take a stance as Irish people in support of our own values and against these discriminatory and highly troubling new orders emanating from President Trump.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#P00300","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485873000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I share the concerns that have been expressed about the recent developments concerning immigration in the USA.

It is important that the Taoiseach visit the White House on St. Patrick's weekend and I disagree with and strongly reject what the Fianna F&aacute;il Seanad leader has said about the Government.  The Government is concerned about the undocumented Irish.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is in Washington as we speak, engaging through his embassy and with his consulate and American officials, and he will highlight the concerns of the undocumented Irish.  The Government appointed a Minister of State for the diaspora.  It appointed a Member of this House, Senator Billy Lawless, who is a strong voice for many of our Irish emigrants in the United States of America.

This is nothing to do with terrorism but rather to do with people's religion.  In the small print and of particular concern to the undocumented Irish, he has ordered the hiring of 15,000 extra enforcement officers.  He has told the people in \"sanctuary cities\", such as San Francisco and Boston, that they can no longer have a system whereby law enforcement officers are not allowed to ask about anyone's immigration status.  They must now start asking about the immigration status of anybody they question about a particular crime or even something as small as running a red light.<\/p> <p>In fairness to Mr. Martin Walsh, Mayor of Boston, he has stood up to President Trump and stated he will not implement this instruction, as have many other mayors throughout the United States.  President Trump stated he would only get rid of criminals in the undocumented 11 million people but his definition of \"criminal\" has again broadened, which means all 11 million people could quite easily fall within the scope of those to be deported.  There will be no comprehensive immigration reform Bill in the United States any time soon, or at all, but we were very close with the McCain-Kennedy Bill in 2007.  The Senate passed a Bill by 68 votes to 32 in 2013 that would have given 10,500 visas to the Irish.  I know Senator Lawless and Mr. Ciaran Staunton of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform worked very hard on that.<\/p> <p>We are asking for a task force because we have spoken with people in the Irish-American community over there.  We have spoken with people in the pastoral centres in New York, Boston and San Francisco, and they will need resources to help those who are arrested.  They will need counselling resources for those who are finding themselves isolated and fearful for their future.  We need a task force to ensure the resources are provided for the Irish-American community, including those 50,000 people under the threat of deportation at any moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#R00200","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1485873000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I congratulate Mr. Groves on his appointment.

Citizens from Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Libya and Yemen will be blocked for three months.  The executive order also included legal permanent residents and dual citizens holding a passport from any of the countries listed.  The result was confusion and fear among immigrant and refugee communities across the United States and at its major airports.  The reaction by ordinary American citizens to this un-American act, however, has been nothing short of extraordinary.  On Sunday, I stood as Senator for the global Irish in solidarity with immigrant and refugee community groups at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.  Over 4,000 people turned out in an impromptu show of force and defiance to denounce President Trump's executive orders.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Billy Lawless:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They were joined by similar protests in New York, Boston, Denver and 33 other airports across the United States.  At one stage more than 50 people were detailed at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.  Citizens and green card holders with valid visas were detained by customs and border control agents operating under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security.  New York Federal Judge, Ms Ann Donnelly, a good Irish-American, granted a stay on deportations and eventually everyone who was detained was released.<\/p><p>On Sunday I met a young man from the Iraqi Mutual Aid Society in Chicago.  His parents are from Iraq and both of them have a green card.  They have spent ten years in Iraq working for American non-governmental organisations helping to rebuild a ravaged country.  Recently, Othman Al Ani's mother travelled to Egypt to visit a son that she had not seen in eight years.  As of Sunday, she remains trapped in Egypt and unable to return home as a result of this ban.  <\/p><p>America is a nation of laws but it is also a nation of values.  It has always been outward looking and welcoming to immigrants of all faiths and lands.  The executive orders do not reflect the spirit of the American people or the country's leadership role in the world.  <\/p><p>I do not believe that President Trump's actions serve the interests of the Muslims who are currently banned from the United States, the 50,000 undocumented Irish living in the United States or the 34 million people in the US who claim Irish ancestry.  I call on the Trump Administration to rescind the executive order.  I call on it to follow the words of Pope Francis who has admonished us to welcome the stranger and those fleeing suffering or persecution.  In this climate, the 50,000 undocumented Irish in the United States are watching closely with fear and trepidation for their future.  President Trump stated in his presidential campaign that those who overstayed their visa were more guilty than those who sneaked across the border into America and that would includes our Irish people.  It is my hope that we can present a united voice in this country that will have a lasting effect.  I hope that we can come together in a collective way to tell President Trump exactly what the citizens of Ireland think of his actions in the past few days.  He may wish to build walls to divide nations but that cannot be our objective.  I fully support the Taoiseach in not rejecting the invitation to visit the White House.  Ireland is the only country that has this honour on its national day, which we have held for the past 60 years.  Many countries are envious of our special relationship.  We need dialogue.  For advocates of immigration reform in the United States like myself and others, it is essential we keep open the gates of communication.  I stand ready to work with the Irish Government to represent the interests of our most vulnerable citizens living abroad.  I call on the Taoiseach to continue to raise this issue at the highest levels of the US Government.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#R00300","speaker":"1429","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485873000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I heartily add my words of congratulation to Mr. Groves on his well deserved appointment.<\/p> <p>We have had a weekend of distress at the airports of the US and elsewhere as a result of President Trump's banning travel to seven countries that have a Muslim majority.  He has turned his back on the plight of refugees.  No matter a person's faith he or she deserves to be protected from conflict and helped to find safety.  I add my voice to all who have appealed to President Trump to show grace and understanding to these people.  His ban does not target terrorists but vulnerable people and, disproportionately, those of Islamic faith.  His action cannot be defended and should not continue.  It is only with understanding and co-operation can we hope to end the conflict and discourage terrorism.  <\/p> <p>On the question of the Taoiseach's visit, it is vital that he travels to Washington on our national day.

I concur with many of the sentiments expressed here today.  What role is the aforementioned Minister of State playing in this scenario?  We need an urgent debate with the Minister of State, within the next seven days if possible, because there are two major international issues looming, one being Brexit and the other the situation in the USA, which is changing daily.  We need to know what role the Minister, Minister of State and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are taking in supporting the diaspora across the board but most particularly in Britain and the US.  What steps are being taken to look after their rights as Irish citizens?  It is a little ironic that Fianna F&aacute;il is now calling for a working group because when it came to supporting votes for the diaspora, it was not so quick to respond.  It is important that we would have a good debate with the Minister or Minister of State, which has not happened to date.<\/p><p>The issues being raised with regard to the treatment of people who come from different backgrounds, religions and countries and so forth should lead us to point to the finger at ourselves and ask how we are treating both migrants and those seeking asylum in this country.  We still have the absolute scandal of a direct provision system in this country which should be dismantled, and I would certainly welcome a debate on that issue.<\/p><p>On the question of migrants, I have been doing quite a bit of work recently in Galway with people working in the hospitality industry.  It is very clear to me from the work I am doing there that we have people in that industry, especially migrants, who are being very seriously abused.  A debate on the working conditions in the hospitality industry is overdue.  It is very important we have such a debate to ensure we can address abuses of all types, be they contractual or related to working conditions as well as physical, sexual or verbal.<\/p><p>While I have called on the Leader to schedule a number of debates, it is imperative that we have a debate with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for the diaspora within the next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#S00900","speaker":"1377","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485873000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I join my colleagues in offering the warmest of congratulations to Martin Groves.  He has been exemplary in the support he has given to us all, especially the Senators who are new to the Chamber.  I wish him every happiness in and enjoyment of his new role and I know that he will perform it wonderfully.<\/p> <p>I am not going to reiterate all the points that have been made regarding concerns about the executive order, which is one of a number of very concerning executive orders that have been issued by the new President of the United States of America.  The executive order, commonly known as the Muslim ban, has been of particular concern because it has immediate relevance for Ireland.  While we can talk about symbolic protests against it, we also need very concrete action in Ireland in terms of how we respond to an executive order which is not just discriminatory but which is very much designed to sow division.  As someone who was an immigrant in America in the past, I am very much aware of the spirit of inclusion and diversity that is at the heart of what has made and grown that country.<\/p> <p>There are concerns relating to the Aviation (Preclearance) Act of 2009.  That Act very clearly requires compatibility with Irish law.  It is imperative there is urgent action to ensure what is happening in our airports is compliant with our UN obligations to refugees, the European Convention on Human Rights and our own laws, particularly in respect of national origin and ensuring equality on that basis.  If we cannot be satisfied as to that, we must consider whether we can continue with the preclearance policies.  We have seen widespread opposition, led in many cases by Irish-Americans in the US, including the Mayor of Boston, Mr. Marty Walsh, who led one of the initiatives with regard to cities of sanctuary.  I urge the Taoiseach and other Ministers to visit Boston and engage with Mr. Walsh.  That would be a constructive measure and would show solidarity with those Irish-Americans whom Mr. Walsh and others are representing.<\/p> <p>I was part of the Irish branch of the women's march on Washington and saw the growing opposition in the US.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are seeing a very systematic silencing of opposition and we need to be very robust in respect of it.  I refer here, for example, to what has happened regarding the National Parks Service, the global gag rule, etc.  There has been a dissolution of checks and balances which has allowed Mr. Steve Bannon, an individual about whom I am concerned and to whom I referred previously in the House, appears to have been recommended for membership of the National Security Council.  In the context of this and of statements made in respect of torture in recent months, I ask that we review the position with regard to Shannon.  Valid concerns have been raised about US military use of Shannon and the need to address them is now more urgent than ever.<\/p><p>When the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade comes before the House, as requested by my colleague, Senator Bacik, I ask that he also address the EU's immigration policy and the partnership framework agreements we are making with countries such as Afghanistan in respect of repatriation.  There is a real concern that Europe needs to observe the highest standards of transparency and equality in context of its migration policies.

The world is quite truly shocked.  Regarding the invitation to the White House, it is more important than ever that we avail of these sorts of diplomatic opportunities.  There is no other place that our Taoiseach should be on our national holiday.<\/p><p>On pre-clearance, as Senator Higgins said, we need to look into the legalities.  However, we must also be very careful not to put that on the table in negotiations because pre-clearance is something for which we are envied.  We must, by all means, be happy in terms of carrying out that function but we also need to be extremely careful before we put that on the table.  There is a queue of other countries waiting for that pre-clearance facility, particularly as it leads to a greater influx of people into one's jurisdiction.<\/p><p>I have raised the issue of alcohol consumption on many occasions.  A recent study in <i>The Lancet<\/i>places Ireland in the top five countries in the world for the highest estimated alcohol intake during pregnancy.  The study concludes that 60% of Irish births show evidence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and that one in every 67 mothers who consumes alcohol during pregnancy will deliver a child with foetal alcohol syndrome.  Foetal alcohol syndrome can cause problems with neurological development and growth and may result in learning difficulties and other such problems for children.  The findings are truly alarming.  Prevention is obviously very easy and would require greater awareness  and education.  I call on the Minister - to whom I have written -  to consider that.  In light of the report to which I refer, we clearly have much to do.  It is no big boast to say that we are in the top five countries globally for alcohol consumption during pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#U00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1485873000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I join others in congratulating Mr. Martin Groves on his appointment.

School principals throughout the country are reporting making 20 or 30 phone calls to try to get teachers to step in when needed, unfortunately without success.  The issue is causing serious problems at primary and secondary level.  When a school cannot find a substitute to stand in for a teacher who is absent, a number of things must happen.  Sometimes a class is divided and that causes disruption for students.  Teachers cannot attend in-service days and principals are sometimes obliged to stand in for colleagues.  Smaller schools are particularly badly hit, especially those with fewer than three teachers on the staff.  Principals have no choice but to use their learning support or resource teachers to cover classes.  This means that the who need the most help are, unfortunately, being discommoded and left out.

I have not forgotten my resolution to continue, during the Order of Business in 2017, to tell the House about some of the realities facing children in mental health treatment on a daily basis.  I will focus on the admission of children to adult psychiatric units.  Senators will be aware that I introduced a Bill in November 2016 to prevent his practice from continuing, but they probably do not know that the main reason for the practice is the unavailability of an out-of-hours service for our children.  In other words, no mental health services are available for our children after 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday and all day at the weekend.  After 5 p.m. on a Friday, children who are in trouble will either be put into an adult psychiatric unit or will be left to handle to handle their own issues with their families.  Senators might recall that, before Christmas, three young people in County Cork took their own lives.  There has been a suggestion that the reason behind these suicides was the absence of 24\/7 treatment.  When are we going to realise that crises do not stop at 5 p.m.?  In this country, many suicides are attempted at the weekend, particularly on Sundays.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, launched a campaign in November in which she committed to providing increased out-of-hours services for children.  I wonder where she is with this.  To where is the &euro;15 million - not the &euro;35 million - provided for 2017 being allocated?  I would like the Leader to ask the Minister of State to report to the House immediately on the progress that is being made with the implementation of this service.

The chances of a person being killed by an armed toddler are greater than by an Islamic extremist.  This shows how silly the process undertaken by the US President has been.

When I think of someone who showed empathy, compassion and love for those who needed it, I think of Luke Kelly because he showed them in abundance.  He reached the hearts of so many in this country and throughout the world.  It is long past time that a statute was put up to his memory in this city.  I posted a message on social media in recent days and never had a response like it.  People really feel strongly about this issue.  I call on the Leader to raise it with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, or whoever he believes is the relevant Minister.  He should determine whether State funding is available and whether there is precedent for making it available.  The answers could enable us to commence the process.

Farmers have reached an agreement with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the Farmers' Charter of Rights 2015-2020.  All of the farming organisations have been out protesting today.  They have made the point that if any other payment in the State that is made as of right, for example, a social welfare payment or the old age pension, was one or two days late, it would not be tolerated.  The matter would be sorted out, rightly so.  The farmers affected have been waiting since October.  The problem affects 9,000 farmers and the average payment involved is &euro;4,000.

Will the Irish Government insist that the North get special status in the negotiations?  Freedom of movement on the island must be a redline issue.  It is vital.  The great repeal Bill will end the EU's legal supremacy in the UK and give Parliament the power to absorb pieces of EU legislation into UK law and scrap elements it does not want.  Is there a danger that EU legislation dealing with equality issues may be scrapped, thus undermining the Good Friday Agreement?

I congratulate Mr. Martin Groves on his appointment.  I wish to expand slightly on what Senators Black and Craughwell have said about Brexit.  I particularly wish to draw the attention of the Leader and the other Members to the report issued recently from the policy department for citizens' rights and constitutional affairs at the European Parliament.  Its forthright conclusion is that Brexit will have a direct impact on the institutional arrangements of the Good Friday Agreement.  That is not political point scoring or academic speculation.  That is the European Parliament and its membership telling us that the vote in England to remove Northern Ireland from the European Union against its will is not just undermining the democratic mandate expressed by the people in the North, but is also actively and institutionally going to undermine the precious arrangements enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement, of which the people in the North and the rest of the country voted overwhelmingly in favour.<\/p><p>The report itself goes into considerable detail about the processes and effects that Brexit will have on the EU, Britain and, most importantly in this instance, Ireland.  At the core of its findings for Ireland, it concludes that, while the EU has brought many benefits in terms of funding streams and structural supports, it will have more than just a financial impact on Ireland, as I said earlier but will have a significant impact on the Good Friday Agreement.  I quote from the report:<\/p><blockquote>The impact will be both political, in particular since the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; an international agreement &ndash; will require alteration, which could lead to instability in the region as well as to tensions between Ireland and the UK, and economic\/technical, as the re-establishment of a hard border between the North and the South could provoke a reversal of improvements in cross-border trade. <\/blockquote> <p>I repeat: &quot;will require alteration&quot;.  I believe that lays out a challenge for us very clearly.  Through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, and the broader Seanad, we should seek, as advocated by other Senators, to engage as a matter of urgency with the policy department for citizens' rights and constitutional affairs at the European Parliament to discuss and hopefully expand upon its findings.  As an institution, this Seanad should make it very clear that we respect the democratic mandate in the North.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I was disappointed the Taoiseach did not make it clear in his engagement with the British Prime Minister yesterday that we respect the democratic mandate expressed in the North and that we, as an institution, will and should, as a right and a matter of principle, argue for special status for the North to remain with the rest of Ireland in the European Union, as exists for other states and arrangements across the Continent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#Z00700","speaker":"1413","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485873000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh le Martin Groves ar an bpost nua a ghlac s&eacute;.<\/p> <p>As Leader of the House and on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I congratulate Martin Groves, an honourable, professional and decent man, on his appointment to the position of Clerk of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

It was an extraordinary decision, irrespective of one's political ideology.  To see fear and panic on the faces of refugees or ordinary American citizens trying to go about their daily lives last weekend was appalling.  Irrespective of those who protested, to hear the testimonies of people separated from their loved ones and to see people preparing to welcome strangers into their homes beggared belief.  Preventing people from entering the United States because of religious faith is un-American.  It does not stand with the American values many of us share.<\/p> <p>It is not a policy that I share.  The Taoiseach has made that clear.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is in Washington in discussions with the American Administration on this matter.  What is extraordinary is that rather than making it the United States of America, the President, Donald Trump, is dividing people.  Irrespective of the views pro or anti expressed by Members this afternoon, there are genuine concerns.  It is important the Government expresses these concerns.<\/p> <p>On the point made by Senator Ardagh, the Government created a Minister with responsibility for the diaspora, Jimmy Deenihan, a post now held by Deputy Joe McHugh.  The Taoiseach appointed Senator Lawless as a representative of the diaspora who has been strong in standing up for it and travelling across America.  I welcome the need for engagement and would be interested to hear Senators Ardagh and Daly flesh out the whole issue of a task force and what it can achieve.  While not ruling it out, we have a Minister and Senator responsible, working on behalf of not just the undocumented Irish but those who work in the pastoral centres across many parts of the United States on behalf of families and our country.  Senator Daly is correct that engaging with the diaspora is critical and maintaining strong ties with our people.  Equally, it is important that the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Irish people, travels on St. Patrick's weekend to the United States of America, goes to the White House and engages with the new President of America, as well as the Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, if he is approved, the US Vice President, Mike Pence, and other members of the Administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#AA00600","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1485873000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#BB00100","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1485873000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>We have access to the highest office of the land in America, to the most powerful person in the world at one level.

As someone who has travelled extensively in America, I believe the removal of US pre-clearance facilities at Irish airports would hinder business.  We must be careful to ensure we do not sever our economic ties with America.  I welcome the Taoiseach's remarks in the D&aacute;il this afternoon and yesterday pointing out that there will be a review of those facilities.<\/p> <p>It is worth putting on the record that those facilities were used by 1.8 million people in Dublin Airport and 204,000 people in Shannon Airport.  That includes tourists, business people and people visiting here from many parts of the world.  It is an important facility.  It allows people travelling to America to use the immigration service on this side of the Atlantic.<\/p> <p>The important point is that Irish law continues to apply.  That is a fundamental point.  The Taoiseach's remarks and action in calling for a review of the pre-clearance facilities are to be welcomed.  We must ensure that we do not in any way hinder the free movement and free travel of people.  I very much look forward to that executive order being modified.  We saw what happened since Saturday when there was a change with respect to green card holders.  I am sure all of us who condemn what has taken place will work to ensure there will a continuing change in that executive order.<\/p> <p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell spoke about Westport House.  I join her in congratulating the Hughes family on their &euro;50 million investment in the house and on the retention of the jobs there.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, the Taoiseach and Mayo County Council for the work they have been doing.  The Senator is right in saying that this is a national and a regional triumph.  It is important that Westport House continues to provide the type of service it has provided in the past.<\/p> <p>In the context of Brexit, I smile at the risk of provoking a row with my good friend, Senator Craughwell, who raised the matter, as did Senators Black and Coffey, and Senator MacLochlainn although I might be wrong on that.

That is why the Government created a second Secretary General post in the Department of the Taoiseach to deal explicitly with issues related to Brexit.  It is also why the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has confirmed that an extra &euro;2.6 billion is being made available to support the economy in responding to Brexit.  It is important that we keep the issue in the political diary and on the political agenda.  It is a little unfair to suggest, therefore, that the Government is not engaging.  The Taoiseach has travelled throughout Europe.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has also travelled, while the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, is engaging on the issue.  It is important that we understand Ireland will be to the forefront with its European Union partners in working to find a solution.  Yesterday the importance of this country and the North-South divide was highlighted to ensure there would not be a hard border.<\/p> <p>Senator Paudie Coffey raised the issue of interconnectivity in Europe and referred to the importance of energy projects.  I will be happy to have the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Energy, Deputy Denis Naughten, come to the House to address those issues.<\/p> <p>Senator Joan Freeman referred to the importance of mental health services.  The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, will be in the House tomorrow to respond to a topical issue raised by Senator Gabrielle McFadden.  The Minister of State has travelled the country and committed to making available the funding she secured in the budget for mental health services.  It is important that we work together to highlight the issue and that the moneys which have been secured be ring-fenced, whether for youth mental health services which the Senator rightly mentioned or the provision of 24-hour support to ensure the availability of people out of hours, an issue on which we all need to seek a solution.  We all commend the Senator for the work she is undertaking in another capacity.  As she rightly said, the problem is one that does not stop at 5 p.m. in the evening or at 5 p.m. on a Friday afternoon.  It is important that we work together to ensure there will be a different approach to how we respond to mental health needs.  A Vision for Change, a document that has evolved into Government policy, perhaps needs to be changed and amended.  To be fair to her, the Minister of State is committed and has worked with the Health Service Executive in recognising, in its service plan, that there are action points to be implemented.<\/p> <p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh asked for the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, Deputy Joe McHugh, to come to the House.  I hope that will happen in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>Senators Alice-Mary Higgins and Martin Conway mentioned Shannon Airport.  We should not react the way we sometimes do when it comes to Shannon Airport.  There is an international agreement that we must honour in keeping with our neutrality, as I am sure the Government will do and is doing.<\/p> <p>The issue of green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payments was raised by Senators Rose Conway-Walsh and P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn.  I can inform Members that today the president of the Irish Farmers Association, Mr. Joe Healy, met departmental officials.  On Friday 1,164 members of the farming community received payments.  I understand there are around 9,000 outstanding payments since October.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, is committed to dealing with the matter to ensure payments will be made as quickly as possible.  There will be weekly payment rounds.  It is important to mention that in some cases GLAS applications must be validated to satisfy EU regulations since the scheme is co-funded by the European Union.<\/p> <p>Senators Frances Black and Catherine Noone raised the very important issue of alcohol misuse, in the context of which they referred to fatal alcohol syndrome and the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  To respond to Senator Frances Black in particular, it is not a matter of Fine Gael supporting the Bill but of all Members of the House supporting it, whether they be Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, Independent, Fine Gael or Labour Party Members.  It is important that there be all-party support for it.  We all want to see a reduction in the level of harm caused by alcohol misuse.<\/p> <p>Senator M&aacute;ire Devine referred to the decision of Mr. Justice Kelly in the High Court in the Angela Kerins case.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=31\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will not get into the minutiae of the ruling but I welcome the decision of Mr. Justice Kelly.

This area touches on and is complementary to some of the other amendments which were raised by Senator Warfield, and I recognise he has withdrawn his amendments.<\/p> <p>Having campaigned very passionately on the children's rights referendum, I very much support the Children and Family Relationships Act.  The key point being discussed in these amendments is the importance of recognising the full diversity of relationships which a child should have.  It is a cross-cutting point.  We will come later to the question of open adoption but there is also the question of how we ensure we are really putting forward the best interests of the child.  I recognise the valuable role of this Bill in producing security and continuity, and allowing for adoption in many circumstances where it is valuable for the child.  However, the child also has a diversity of relationships, not just with the birth parents but with the wider family, for example, the siblings they may have and the grandparents.  We are aware that, in many cases, it may be difficult for grandparents to either foster or adopt due to constraints such as age and circumstance, so it is very important that the diversity of relationships be maintained.<\/p> <p>I know this is very strongly felt by many organisations which work on a voluntary basis across such cases in Ireland.  We see voluntary arrangements being put in place between new adoptive parents and former birth parents but they have no legal status or security.  Moreover, in what I believe is an omission, they are not reflected in the Bill due to the constraints of our current model of adoption, which is very much a zero-sum model and one I do not believe serves the wider best interests of the child.  I believe this Bill is and should be the opportunity to develop a genuinely strong network of relationships for the child to ensure that possibility exists.<\/p> <p>I also want to speak about a contact plan being put in place, potentially not just at the point of adoption, but perhaps at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017013100002#EE01300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485873000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
