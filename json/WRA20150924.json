This partnership model provides my Department with a welcome opportunity to work with other bodies and agencies to achieve its strategic objectives and specifically those concerning the promotion of biodiversity, conservation and related education.  It also demonstrates the benefits of central and local government cooperation and collaboration. The Dublin Bay Biosphere represents a significant, exciting and unique opportunity to combine the interests of central and local government with those of the private sector and local businesses and communities in the Dublin Bay area. In the <i>Programme for Government<\/i>, we have placed much emphasis on the importance of tourism for the national recovery and specifically improving our tourism product. In this regard, I am confident that this biosphere project of international significance will bring much needed economic stimulus and employment opportunities to local communities in the Bay area.<\/p><p>This designation is a significant development for the Dublin Bay Area as it will provide the catalyst for local businesses and communities to demonstrate their green and conservation credentials and to explore and capitalise on the resulting commercial opportunities. It is expected that significant economic benefits will accrue from a UNESCO biosphere designation, through investment in heritage, culture, science and education and the promotion of sustainable products and services, and also sustainable tourism. <\/p><p>In addition to the promotion of conservation and biodiversity issues, the biosphere presents an opportunity to develop a unique brand identity for Dublin Bay to promote its amenity and recreation value. It presents a wonderful opportunity to promote Dublin as a city close to nature, providing a new incentive for people to visit the Dublin Bay area.  It will augment the existing tourist attractions of Dublin City, attracting a new type of visitor, and as part of a multi-activity holiday will provide an added attraction that will encourage an extended length of stay and repeat visits from visitors in the valuable adventure tourism bracket. <\/p><p>In relation to dredging\/dumping at sea proposals, it is the function of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue Dumping at Sea permits and Integrated Pollution Control licences.

This has included intense and ongoing engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and the European Commission.<\/p><p>A long-term compensation scheme has also been introduced to compensate cutters for their loss arising from the cessation. This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years, or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.  3,134 applications have been received under this scheme to date. Of these, 719 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.<\/p><p>The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was published in January 2014. It sets out how raised bog SACs are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the complexity involved, progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in a number of cases. Potential relocation sites have been identified for each of the raised bog SACs where relocation may be required. When relocation sites have been assessed as suitable, my Department has been seeking expressions of interest from turf cutters with a view to them moving to these sites. <\/p><p>For a number of these SACs, the relocation site identified may not be suitable or may not have the capacity to cater for the number of turf cutters who may wish to relocate there. In such cases, and in the context of the finalisation of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, my Department, in consultation with turf cutting interests, is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of the EU Habitats Directive. Under article 6.3 of the Directive, consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog SAC where it can be shown that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the site. Under article 6.4 of the Directive, consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog SAC for imperative reasons of overriding public interest. <\/p><p>Given the clear scientific evidence of the negative impact of turf extraction on raised bogs, it will only be possible to utilise the provisions of article 6.3 in a small number of cases. Similarly, the flexibility provided for under article 6.4, if required, will only be applicable to a small number of sites.<\/p><p>Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland's raised bog SACs will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established with the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.<\/p><p>The <i>Review of the Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, <\/i>published in January 2014<i>, <\/i>provides detail on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 current raised bog natural heritage areas. The Review has concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. This will entail the phasing out of turf-cutting on certain natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain natural heritage areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400044#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Protection Areas Designation","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400044#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[32061\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400044#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she has put in place a scheme of compensation for farmers whose lands have been designated as hen harrier special protection areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1198","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>Special Protection Areas are designated in accordance with the provisions of the EU Birds Directive, which has been transposed into national law under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.

I am conscious that an early solution is required and my Department will continue to work positively with the committee with a view to facilitating a satisfactory outcome. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400044#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400044#WRB03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Registration Legislation","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400044#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[32566\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400044#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"following the recent publication of the Marriage Bill 2015, if consideration will be given to facilitating the appointment of notaries public as marriage registrars, in order to meet the increased demand for marriage registrations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>The Civil Registration Act 2004, as amended, provides for the categories of bodies and organisations which may apply for registration of persons on the Register of Solemnisers maintained by the Registrar-General.  <\/p><p>These are:<\/p><p>-The Health Service Executive for the registration of a registrar employed by the Executive,<\/p><p>-A religious body (as defined) for the registration of a member of that body, and<\/p><p>-A secular body (as defined) for the registration of a member of that body.<\/p><p>As Notaries Public do not fall into any of these categories it is not possible to enter them on the Register of Solemnisers. <\/p><p>The increased demand for marriage solemnisations arising from the implementation of the same-sex marriage provisions in the Marriage Bill 2015 will be offset to a significant extent by the cessation in the registration of civil partnerships which is also provided for in the Bill. <\/p><p>There are no plans to change the categories of bodies and organisations which may apply to have their members entered on the Register of Solemnisers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400044#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[32567\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400045#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the procedures for a person to qualify and to become employed as a registrar of marriages and-or as a civil solemniser; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the categories of marriage solemniser on the Register of Solemnisers maintained by the Registrar-General.

I met with the six main mortgage lenders and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to Irish customers was too high.\u00a0Subsequent to these meetings, the main banks put initiatives in place to allow borrowers to reduce payments. Such initiatives range from lower variable rates and lower fixed rate products to new suites of variable rates based on loan to values. <\/p>  <p>  I have just this week concluded a further series of meetings with the main banks.

Central Bank research suggests that 21% of existing PDH variable rate mortgage customers could save by switching their provider.

This report was published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas\u00a0on 16th\u00a0July 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Following the completion of the report, and taking into account what NAMA has achieved to date, my officials concluded that:<\/p>  <p>  - \tNAMA has made significant progress in achieving its overall objectives.<\/p>  <p>  -\tBased on NAMA's performance to date and its financial projections in light of the strength of current investor interest in Ireland, NAMA is well positioned to achieve its objectives.<\/p>  <p>  -\tAs a result, NAMA's continuation is necessary to achieve these objectives.<\/p>  <p>  Following the completion of\u00a0the Section 227 Report in\u00a0July 2014, the NAMA Board also\u00a0committed to two initiatives in addition to their debt redemption objectives. <\/p>  <p>  The first is to ensure the timely and coherent delivery of key Grade A office, retail and residential space within the Dublin Docklands Strategic Developments Zone (SDZ) and Dublin's Central Business District. NAMA holds an interest in 75% of the 22 hectares of developable land within the Dublin Docklands SDZ and estimate that up to 3.8 million sq. ft. of commercial space and 1,950 apartments could be delivered in all the sites in the Dublin Docklands SDZ in which NAMA has an interest.<\/p>  <p>  The second is to maximise the delivery of residential housing units in areas of most need, specifically through the commitment to deliver 4,500 residential units in Dublin by the end of 2016. NAMA is on course to meet this target and, since 2014, has funded the delivery of more than 1,700 new housing units across 39 sites in the Greater Dublin Area.\u00a0 This activity has resulted in NAMA funding the delivery of 40% of new housing units in Dublin in 2014 and 50% in the first half of 2015. The Agency has also indicated they will facilitate delivery of new homes elsewhere in the country in line with demand over this period. <\/p>  <p>  These initiatives are entirely consistent with NAMA's core\u00a0mandate of\u00a0maximising the\u00a0return to the taxpayer. \u00a0Furthermore the oversight provisions,\u00a0contained in the Act, also\u00a0allow me to regularly\u00a0monitor\u00a0NAMA's activity, role, and performance towards meetings it's objectives.<\/p>  <p>  For example NAMA's\u00a0Annual Report and Financial Statements are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. \u00a0The level of disclosure in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements is comprehensive and professional. \u00a0I\u00a0would encourage anyone interested  in the workings and performance of NAMA\u00a0who have not yet\u00a0read these reports to take the time to do so as\u00a0they are a rich source of information regarding NAMA's performance. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, under Section 53 of the NAMA Act,\u00a0NAMA is also required to submit to me an Annual Statement by 30 September each year setting out its proposed objectives for the following financial year, the scope of activities to be undertaken, its strategies and policies and its proposed use of resources. <\/p>  <p>  NAMA is also required to report to me on a quarterly basis giving detailed information about its loans, its financing arrangements and its income and expenditure. These reports, which also include other information specified under Section 55 of the NAMA Act, track NAMA's\u00a0progress on a quarterly basis.\u00a0 For example, the most recent report for Quarter 1 2015 highlighted some key recent achievements on the Dublin Docklands SDZ, Residential, and Social Housing facilitation.<\/p>  <p>  The Chairman and Chief Executive are also accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) and other Oireachtas committees and to give evidence to those committees whenever required to do so - and most recently\u00a0 attended the PAC on 9 July 2015.\u00a0Transcripts of these appearances are available from the Oireachtas website.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA's accounts are\u00a0also\u00a0comprehensively audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. For large parts of the year - typically between September and May   C&amp;AG staff are based in the Agency, performing their audit function, with unrestricted access to all its records and files.\u00a0\u00a0The Comptroller and Auditor General has already produced three special reports on NAMA's activities and they have been broadly positive in their assessment of how NAMA is managing its complex business.\u00a0I note that their upcoming tri-annual review will focus on value for money and will examine some of the Agency's landmark sales processes.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore,\u00a0given the many oversight\u00a0provisions\u00a0already in place,\u00a0I\u00a0would not intend to conduct a stand-alone review of NAMA's role and remit prior to the next scheduled Section 227 report, which is due in 2019 -\u00a0one year prior to NAMA's expected dissolution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400050#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Interest Directors","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400050#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[32633\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400050#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he will appoint an additional public interest director to the board of Bank of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>I can confirm for the\u00a0Deputy that I have notified Bank of Ireland that\u00a0my current intention is to appoint a replacement director in due course\u00a0 to the  board of Bank of Ireland, following the\u00a0sad loss of Mr Joe Walsh.\u00a0I am not in a position at this stage to give a specific date however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400050#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Restructuring","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400050#WRH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[32634\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400050#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update on Permanent TSB's plans to sell non-performing mortgages; the number, and book value, of mortgages for sale; the current position with regard to the proposed sale; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The concept of \"tax foregone\" is arguably more applicable in the context of tax reliefs where there is a choice as to whether to pursue the particular policy stance or not. In that regard, it is important to note that these grandfathering arrangements were not considered optional and were provided in the legislation following legal advice to that effect from the Attorney General. In other words, introducing the SFT regime required the simultaneous protection of pension rights that had been built up legitimately by individuals under the tax provisions that applied up to the relevant dates. This was the firm legal advice to the Government when the SFT was introduced and on each subsequent occasion that the SFT limit was reduced. The choice, therefore, was to introduce the SFT regime, with grandfathering, or not at all. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, according to their records, since 7 December 2010, when the SFT was reduced to &euro;2.3 million, they have issued 941 PFT certificates with a value of some &euro;2,975 million. Since 1 January 2014, when the SFT was further reduced to &euro;2 million, Revenue has to date issued a further 651 PFT certificates with a total value of some &euro;1,441 million. The combined overall value of PFT certificates issued since 7 December 2010 is, therefore, &euro;4,416 million. The cumulative additional value of pension benefits protected as compared with the SFT limits applying at 7 December 2010 and 1 January 2014, respectively is, therefore, some &euro;950 million. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400051#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Audits","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400051#WRJ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":269,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[32708\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400051#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the current status of a Revenue Commissioners tax audit of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which was under way at the time of the liquidation; the nature of the investigation; when it is expected it will be concluded; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":270,"content":"<p>I want to say clearly at the outset that I consider that it would be entirely inappropriate for me to comment on any relationship between the Revenue Commissioners and an individual taxpayer or business.

More comprehensive data on e-cigarette use in Ireland will be available shortly from the Healthy Ireland Survey.<\/p><p>E-cigarettes and other non-medicinal nicotine delivery systems are not regulated under tobacco control legislation because they do not contain tobacco.

Hence, there are legitimate concerns about the public health benefits of allowing such products to exist without regulation.

The legislation, approved by Government will also prohibit the sale of these products to, and by, persons under 18 years of age.<\/p><p>Currently the evidence base does not support prohibiting vaping in public places although individual organisations\/companies are free to introduce an e-cigs free policy. My Department will continue to monitor evidence on the potential harms and benefits of these products, so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400056#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400056#WRO01100"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[32518\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400056#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress to date in determining eligibility for a medical card in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Under these provisions, persons who are insured with (covered by) the healthcare service of one EU member state are entitled to receive healthcare in the public system of another member state in certain circumstances, at the cost of the member state in which they are insured.  Such persons may include:<\/p><p>- people who are employed in one member state and resident in another and their dependants,<\/p><p>- pensioners of one member state who reside in another and their dependants,<\/p><p>- visitors to one member state from another, and<\/p><p>- persons referred for treatment to another member state.<\/p><p>The EU Regulations provide for the costs to be reimbursed between member states. The Regulations also allow for two or more states to agree alternative arrangements for reimbursement other than those laid down in the Regulations, or to mutually waive reimbursement altogether.<\/p><p>Ireland's primary interaction has been and continues to be with the United Kingdom with whom it operates a bilateral healthcare reimbursement agreement, covering such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country. Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.  The amount payable is the net difference between the costs to the Irish health services of providing care to those with only UK entitlements and the cost to the UK health services of providing services to those with only Irish entitlements.  The amount payable is agreed following compilation of the necessary data and discussions between the two administrations.  Payments are made in advance and are subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information is complete. Total payments in any one year can as a consequence relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current and\/or previous years. The finalisation of accounts is normally some years in arrears to facilitate collation of relevant statistics and for the approval of the average cost prepared by each country for the year concerned at EU level.  The net payment received by Ireland from the United Kingdom in 2014 was &euro;172 m.  This amount represents the actual payment made in cash in 2014 and does not correspond to the full liability for that particular year.<\/p><p>As explained below, only a small portion of the above payments relates to UK visitors to Ireland and Irish visitors to the UK.  By far the largest part of the payment received from the UK authorities on an annual basis relates to the provision of healthcare to UK pensioners and their dependants residing in Ireland. Entirely separate arrangements apply to patient referrals for scheduled treatment in the other jurisdiction whereby the costs arising are reimbursed on an actual costs basis. These arrangements are administered by the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p>The amount payable in any one year attributable to temporary visitors between Ireland and the UK (i.e. EHIC type costs) is determined by the estimated number of visitor days and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  The last accounts finalised were in respect of the year 2008 in respect of which Ireland&rsquo;s liability to the United Kingdom was calculated at Stg &pound;10,161,467 (&euro;12,269,340 approximately) for 22,945,700 visitor days (Ireland to UK) and the United Kingdom liability to Ireland was &euro;17,735,993 for 19,095,600 visitor days (UK to Ireland).

Circular 25\/02 which is available on the Department website outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties. Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.

My Department has done work at helping to ease the administrative burden on school principals. The development and introduction of the primary online database is a significant step forward in this regard.

In this context and coupled with the need to ensure sufficient budgetary resources to LAGs to facilitate full and effective implementation of local development strategies, and to ensure administrative efficiency Ireland is proposing to limit the number of LAGS to 28 to mirror Irish local government administrative areas. This will allow for more efficient and effective systems of oversight, coordination and support by both local government and the managing authority to ensure that the impact of all funding available to the sub-regional area is maximised. <\/p>  <p>  Most of the 28 areas outlined have total populations below 150,000. However, there are a small number of areas where the populations (excluding the cities) may breach the 150,000 limit. In order to maintain the integrity of the LAG selection process it will not be possible to be specific on which areas may result in an LDS population of over 150,000 as the populations in need of Rural Development\/LEADER support will be determined through the LDS design process. While it is envisaged that no area will have populations above approximately 170,000, there is some potential for areas with populations above the 150,000 population limit outlined in the regulation and therefore Ireland is requesting a derogation from this upper population limit to take account of population levels in some rural areas, to ensure territorial coherence of the LAG area, and to support Irelands increased emphasis on more effective, coordinated systems of local and rural development at a sub-regional level.\"   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400060#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Data","counter":558,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400060#WRS01350"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[32483\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400060#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide, by local authority, the amount of funding provided to each local authority to refurbish social housing voids in 2015, as well as figures detailing the number of voids that have been refurbished to date in 2015.","asker":"1101","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>I announced funding totalling &euro;20.184 million in May 2015 to support all local authorities to deliver an initial 2015 target of returning 1,104 vacant social housing units back to productive use.

This lead-in period is intended to allow site owners sufficient time and opportunity to obtain planning permission, initiate development or alternatively sell their sites in order to avoid becoming liable to the levy. The levy proceeds will be earmarked for regeneration and the provision of housing in the local areas concerned.<\/p><p>Supplementary to the vacant site levy, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015amends Section 10(2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, to provide that the current objective incorporated in local authority development plans for the &ldquo;development and renewal of areas in need of regeneration&rdquo; is broadened to provide that such objective should in future be for the explicit purposes of preventing &ndash;<\/p><p>-  adverse effects on existing amenities in such areas,<\/p><p>-  urban blight and decay,<\/p><p>-  anti-social behaviour, or <\/p><p>-  a shortage of habitable houses or land suitable for residential use or a mixture of residential or other uses.<\/p><p>This is intended to stimulate local authorities to adopt a more holistic approach in relation to urban decay and regeneration in the adoption of their local development plans.<\/p><p>In addition to the recently enacted vacant site levy, the Derelict Sites Act 1990 requires that local authorities take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become or continue to be a derelict site. Local authorities have substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on derelict sites, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site. Under the provisions of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, the Derelict Site levy willnot be payable in respect of any land on which the vacant site levy is payable.<\/p><p>In 2014, in its Partnership Agreement with the European Commission, the Government agreed that an urban development fund would be established. The Designated Urban Centres Grants Scheme (subsequently launched in July 2015)  will enable investments in our main urban centres to the order of &euro;80 million for the period 2014-2020. This investment in sustainable urban development recognises our main cities as the engines of the regional economy, and specifically seeks to increase the number of integrated regeneration initiatives that willimprove the urban environment and revitalise Irish urban areas. <\/p><p>In tandem with this urban focus, the Government has this week reaffirmed its commitment to rural Ireland with the announcement of a new &euro;30m investment in rural towns and villages in the years ahead. The new scheme will support the revitalisation of our rural towns and villages, increase their attractiveness and sustainability, with the aim of improving the living and working environment in rural communities and enhancing their potential to support increased economic activity into the future. <\/p><p>The focus for improvements eligible under this scheme will extend to the enhancement of villages, small towns and the surrounding countryside.

They are not coming here with their bicycles or hiring bicycles to cycle alongside a road - the route needs to be attractive in its own right.

The amendments, which take effect from the 1 July 2015, will reduce the monthly cost for these borrowers and avoid existing rental equity balances increasing for the\u00a0remaining term.

Considerable employment benefits arising from the capital projects under way or being planned.  For example, some 200 jobs have been created in the construction stage of the new interpretative centre in the GPO.  In addition, some 300 high-level jobs have been created in the construction work on the National Gallery of Ireland as part of a joint project funded by my Department, the OPW and the National Gallery. <\/p><p>The built heritage jobs leverage scheme was a funded by a special &euro;5 million stimulus package in 2014.  It was very successful and leveraged a further &euro;10 million in private funding and many projects benefited from it.  Funding for the protection of heritage sites and buildings will continue to be provided by my Department in 2015 via a number of schemes, which will be either directly administered or delivered through local authorities or through the Heritage Council.<\/p><p>I am aware of the potential of the creative sector to contribute to sustainable jobs growth and my Department continues to work with other Departments as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall objectives under the Action Plan for Jobs. <\/p><p>The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.  The Government also appreciates the importance of the cultural and creative industries to Ireland and our economy and provides significant support for the arts and film through its funding of the Arts Council and the Film Board, while my Department provides capital supports for the development of arts and cultural infrastructure. <\/p><p>Other financial and policy supports are also provided, for example, through the taxation system.  I was particularly pleased that the Government introduced a 25% increase, from &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000, in the income ceiling for the artists' tax exemption for 2015. This important measure recognises the invaluable contribution which artists make to society. <\/p><p>My Department - through Culture Ireland &ndash; plays a major part in promoting Irish arts and music on the world stage.  The Arts Council operates the RAISE programme, which seeks to enhance fund-raising skills in arts organisations with a view to reducing the sector&rsquo;s dependency on funding from the taxpayer and moving it more towards the business sector. My has Department also operated small capital grants schemes, which require to be co-funded from private or philanthropic sources. These initiatives assist the sector in securing philanthropic contributions to the arts in Ireland.<\/p><p>Finally, issues in relation to the arts, film and music are will be of particular relevance in the development of Ireland's first national cultural policy, <i>Culture 2025<\/i>.  My Department has commenced the engagement in a nationwide consultation process on the development of the policy and I look forward to working further with the all interested parties as part of that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400064#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Promotion","counter":700,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400064#WRW01350"},{"type":"question","counter":701,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[32685\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400064#WRW01400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which her Department supports, or plans to offer support to, various community-based local community arts groups or associations, with particular reference to the recognition of many excellent productions by same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"973"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[32687\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400064#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the degree to which her Department supports, or expects to support, various festivals of the arts in the context of traditional or contemporary music, local drama production and-or musical societies; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"973"},{"type":"question","counter":703,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[32688\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400064#WRW01600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she expects the Arts Council to be in a position to meet its supportive requirements in full in the current year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"973"},{"type":"question","counter":704,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[32692\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092400064#WRW01700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she and her Department continue to promote an appreciation of the arts and national heritage to young people, whether through schools or otherwise; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":705,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236, 238, 239 and 243 together.<\/p><p>The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts, and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.<\/p><p>Primary responsibility for the promotion and support of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.
