I remind members that we have scheduled a private meeting this evening at 6.30 to take legal advice on the information we received from the Garda whistleblower.  As agreed last week, we will publish our report on banking stabilisation as an interim report as soon as the clerk has finalised it, which will be in the next few days.  We will then write to the former regulator, the Central Bank and officials in the Department of Finance requesting that they make themselves available for a hearing on the report.<\/p><p>  Nos. 1 and 2 on the agenda relate to the minutes of our meeting of Thursday, 21 November.  Are the minutes agreed to?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  We will now deal with correspondence received since the meeting of 21 November.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence, dated 15 November 2013, from Ms Regina Gannon, chief financial officer of IDA Ireland, responding to issues raised at the meeting of 19 September 2013.  The correspondence is be noted and published.<\/p><p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 21 November 2013, from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, setting out steps to provide protection for whistleblowers.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.<\/p> <p>I am going to ask that we respond to the letter by saying the whistleblower in the north east has expressed grave concerns about her safety at work owing to bullying and intimidation.  We should also ask that the spirit of the legislation be applied in her case.<\/p><p> No. 3A.4 is correspondence, dated 26 November 2013, from Mr. Paul Maloney, former CEO of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, regarding an invitation to our meeting on 28 November.  As stated, that meeting has been postponed.  However, Mr. Maloney is working abroad and has apologised to the committee for not being in possession of sufficient information to attend tomorrow.  I suggest we arrange a further meeting with him and Ms Brennan, the current CEO of the DDDA, as soon as possible.  Perhaps both of them might come before us on the same day - at separate hearings - in order that we might finalise our report on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112700002#A00300","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385564700,"counter":9,"content":"<p>In his correspondence Mr. Maloney claims that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not providing him with information to assist him in appearing before the committee.

The people who are dealing with NAMA versus Ulster Bank, ACC or the other banks which are managing out a book say it is far quicker to deal with those than it is to deal with NAMA and that its commerce decisions are not the best that could be done for Ireland, especially as we are coming out of the recovery programme and NAMA is the largest asset holder in the State.<\/p><p>  I also have a concern about the fact that NAMA is receiving VAT payments in respect of rent on behalf of people and that money is not being paid over to the Revenue Commissioners, rather it is being kept as a liability personally for the individual concerned.

As they will be aware, we recently submitted to the committee a copy of the HSE's internal audit report, entitled Internal Audit Report - Section 38 Agencies Remuneration, which is the subject of today's hearing.  I do not propose to go into the detail of the report in my opening statement as we will discuss it but I would like to make the following points.<\/p><p>  Between March and November 2011, the HSE, at the request of the Department of Health, sought to establish the level of compliance by section 38 agencies with various aspects of approved public sector pay policy.  In March 2011, the HSE sought confirmation from section 38 agencies of their adherence to approved health salary scales.  Later in July of that year, we requested each section 38 agency to confirm their compliance with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, FEMPI, and that the performance related award scheme continued to be suspended.  At that time, the HSE reiterated that, in compliance with Government policy, bonus payments should not be made.  In September of 2011, the HSE sought confirmation that section 38 agency chief executive officers were not in receipt of additional remuneration for any services or duties required by virtue of their role.<\/p> <p>That was followed up in October 2011 when we sought information on allowances and regrading and whether they had appropriate approval.  Later in November 2011, we sought confirmation of compliance with the one person, one salary principle that board fees should not be paid to public sector employees who sit on their own organisation's board or the boards of other public sector organisations.<\/p><p> Between March and May 2012, there were media reports that executives in a HSE-funded agency were in receipt of additional remuneration and a HIQA report identified that an executive in another HSE-funded agency was in receipt of additional remuneration.  In May 2012, the HSE wrote to the section 38 agencies requesting that they provide the HSE with the remuneration details of senior managers employed or contracted by the agency, including pay, allowances, grants, bonuses, foundation payments and payments from any other body or organisation to the individual managers.  The human resources section of the HSE received the requested information from the section 38 agencies.<\/p><p> In June 2012, the then CEO of the HSE requested HSE internal audit to undertake a review of the remuneration paid by section 38 agencies to their senior management.  The audit identified significant key findings, which we will discuss during the hearing.  The auditor's overall assessment of the control environment was that it was considered to be seriously inadequate due to the significance of the issues identified.  The internal audit report, which was presented at a meeting of the HSE board on 23 July 2013, made 22 recommendations to address the issues and HSE management unreservedly accepted the recommendations and immediately set about putting into action the recommendations in conjunction with the Department of Health.  To date, nine of the 22 recommendations have been fully implemented, a further eight are in progress and five have been identified as superseded.  A copy of the status update on the recommendations in the report was previously provided to the committee on 14 November 2013.<\/p><p> In response to a number of the recommendations contained in the audit report on 27 September 2013 the Department of Health, following consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, issued Circular 11\/2013 on compliance with health sector pay policy as it applies to the health services and in particular to those bodies funded by the HSE in whole or in part.  The circular reflects Government policy on senior public service pay.  The policy makes it clear that bodies funded under section 38 of the Health Act 2004 may not supplement approved rates of remuneration either with Exchequer funding or non-Exchequer sources of funding.  The Department of Health circular was issued to the health sector by the national director of human resources by way of HSE HR Circular 016\/2013 on 30 September 2013.  This communication issued to the CEOs of the section 38 agencies.  It included a copy of the audit report and sought confirmation of compliance with the terms of the Department of Health circular.  Agencies were requested to confirm their unequivocal confirmation of compliance by 28 October 2013 and were advised that failure to provide a reply by that date would be considered an unqualified confirmation of compliance with the pay policy.<\/p><p> By 28 October 2013, responses had been received from 33 of the agencies, with a number of agencies responding with a holding position stating that additional time was needed to consider the implications of the circular.  Some agencies also identified the need to seek legal advice in respect of existing contractual arrangements.  On 5 November 2013, the national director of HR sent a further letter to agencies that had responded with a holding position.  This letter reiterated the requirement to deal with this issue as a matter of urgency and requested a comprehensive response no later than 19 November 2013.  On 22 November 2013 the national director of HR wrote to five agencies that had not provided a response to the initial letter in September, which indicated unqualified compliance, requesting that for completeness and in an effort to avoid any confusion they would provide a formal response to the confirmations sought by return.  Of the 42 responses received to date, 30 agencies have categorised themselves as compliant and 12 non-compliant.  Of the 30 confirming compliance it should be noted that seven agencies are considered as being in compliance; 15 agencies indicated remuneration being paid which is not in compliance with the pay policy; seven agencies were identified through the information provided to internal audit as paying non-compliant remuneration; and one agency submitted formal approval from the Department of Health for the non-compliant allowance being paid.  To date, one agency has not yet responded.<\/p><p> For the avoidance of doubt, my position on this matter is that the HSE will deem to be non-compliant any agency that has one or more employee whose pay does not conform to health pay policy.  Some agencies currently claim to be compliant while at the same time identifying individual exceptions.  For this reason a further process of verification and clarification is required for agencies categorising themselves as compliant where there is recorded deviation from the pay policy, and until the situation in each organisation has been fully verified, none of these organisations can be deemed fully compliant.  Further action will be taken by the HSE to ensure the full implementation of the provisions of the health sector pay policy as a matter of priority, and in this regard we intend to work with each agency to ensure compliance with Government pay policy.<\/p><p> As set out in section 7 of the pay policy, if an organisation wishes to make a business case for the continuation of an unapproved allowance, it is open to it to do so and any such cases will be considered by the HSE, with the involvement of the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A business case will also be required for the continued payment of allowances which are not encompassed by or in line with the Department of Health consolidated salary scales but which may have been sanctioned in the past.  There has been much media focus on the individual recipients of payments encompassed by this audit report.  Our focus is on the governance of the agencies that have acted, or in some instances may have acted, outside their authority in inappropriately offering and then paying amounts that are neither sanctioned nor authorised.  It is those who purported to authorise such payments rather than those who received them who have serious questions to answer.<\/p><p> I would also like to refer briefly to the speculation in the media about the timing of the HSE's provision of the internal audit report to this committee and in particular the manner in which it was presented to the committee, namely, during the committee's examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter on medical cards on 14 November.  I wish to state categorically that such speculation is without foundation.  The facts are simple.  The HSE had been in receipt of two freedom of information requests from the media for the release of the report.  In addition, the Department also had a freedom of information request from the media for the report as well as all correspondence between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform relating to the matter.  The material was due to be released in compliance with freedom of information legislation on 15 November.  It was important for the HSE, as a matter of due respect to this committee and the Oireachtas, that the committee would be provided with the report before it appeared in the media.  Accordingly, we provided the report to the committee on 14 November on that basis.  I referred to that in my opening statement on the day.  That concludes my opening statement and, together with my colleagues, we will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112700004#C02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385565900,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Can we publish the statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112700005#D00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385565900,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112700005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1385565900,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Brien is very welcome.

Some had service agreements; others did not.  There were different standards and so on, but the important point to bear in mind is that, in 2009, the HSE engaged in a process with the agencies to develop a governance framework.  The service arrangements were put in place in 2010.  The HSE went back again, in consultation with the agencies, and put a revised, enhanced service arrangement in place for 2011.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is asking about the provisions for pay.

Essentially, the HSE's documentation states that out of the 43 agencies that have replied, only seven are fully compliant.  As far as the HSE is concerned, 36 of the 43 are not yet compliant .  Given the internal audit report was completed on 15 March and several months have passed, could more progress had been made with the aforementioned 36 agencies?  Is the HSE satisfied at the rate of progress in recent months?  Mr. O'Brien provided members with an update on the implementation of the 22 audit recommendations.  In light of the recent information the HSE has received, does that schedule require revision regarding the level of progress?  Some agencies were indicating compliance would be achieved by certain dates but in light of the more recent information received, this appears to have been moved somewhat.  I accept the report the HSE gave to the committee on 14 November probably was valid up to that time.  However, has the HSE subsequently received any information that might oblige it to revise that report?

In that context and with regard to the actions we have been taking since then, I am satisfied with progress.  I of course would be happier were a greater number of these agencies in a position to satisfy us of their compliance.  However given that the clear statement of policy against which we now are judging compliance was available to us at the end of September - I  believe it issued on 30 September - the rate of progress since then has been reasonably good.  We expect that more of these agencies will be in a position to assure us of compliance than have yet done so.

It is to do with the validation process of the audit.  As the committee will be aware, I circularised the agencies on 25 June last at the start of this audit and I provided back to the agencies the information that they had provided to HR.  I asked the agencies if they could please review this information and confirm to me that it was correct or, if they would like to update it, to do so.  I asked them to confirm that what they were providing me with was the totality of the information - the pay remuneration package.  I also asked them about pensions, bonuses, travel allowances, board directors' fees, etc.  I also ask them to confirm which elements of the information they were providing came from public and from private sources.  That information came back.  As Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins mentioned, it is self-declaration.  I reviewed that and analysed it.<\/p><p>  One of the validation tests I did on that was to ask the agencies then to confirm to me what figures they had provided back to the Revenue in terms of the gross income for the individual persons.  I did not want net figures or anything like that.  It was the gross, what was chargeable to tax.  That exercise took some time.  Agencies came back with the information.<\/p><p>  I did a reasonableness check on what they had originally provided and what they were saying they had returned.  That indicated one or two issues for me where I was able to go back to the agencies to ask could they please explain because I did not understand why there is a differential, and they were able to explain.  In one particular case, they came back and said they had under declared to me and provided me with a further private allowance.  Overall it was a reasonableness check.  That, essentially, represented what went through the payrolls of those agencies.<\/p><p>  I also asked the agencies to confirm how many payrolls they were running, again, cognisant of the fact that the HIQA report on Tallaght had identified an external payroll, and they came back to indicate the number of payrolls.

We are all aware that health and public service workers and the services themselves have taken hits over the past few years.

We were talking earlier about compliance and how we need to get to a situation where all of these agencies are compliant.

The reply was in the public domain.  Further issues arose subsequently, which I will outline in sequence to provide a better context.  In 1998, as part of enhancing partnership discussions on disability services, one of the quotes from an agency was that the Department of Health was aware that chief officers were being paid over and above the rates through other sources of funds.  In July 2008, the Department requested the HSE to write to the disability agencies to seek all expenditure, whether funded by the HSE or otherwise.  In August 2008, the HSE wrote to the agencies.  In October 2008 the Department wrote to the head of human resources in the HSE to advise that there may be cases in voluntary agencies - hospitals - where unauthorised salaries were in payment.  It arrived at that view because it was dealing with a particular case.  In January 2009 the HSE submitted a report on pay and non-pay expenditure in non-statutory disability service providers to the Department, which noted that certain agencies reported that some of the salaries they paid were supplemented with fund raising and retail income.  In 2009, the Department wrote to a particular agency to raise a list of hybrid pay scales and to note that they were not authorised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112700012#L02000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1385570100,"counter":312,"content":"<p>When did Dr. Smith reach a point where there was no longer any ambiguity on whether the agencies were in breach of Government pay scales?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112700012#L02100","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385570100,"counter":313,"content":"<p>It is clear from the service level arrangements to which I referred earlier.

Once the cheque leaves the HSE or the Department of Health, to a large degree people have been left to their own devices, or certainly have not been scrutinised as well as they should have been.  However, it seems to be a case of \"Here we go again.\"  The HSE is in trying to clean up the mess and we are here trying to find out what went on, and nobody is responsible.  The boards or the section 38 agencies have made these payments that never should have been made.  There were, to use the witness's words, potentially nod-and-wink or verbal agreements with the attitude of: \"Your man down the road said I could have the payment.\"  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has advised us that there is no paper trail for any of these verbal agreements.<\/p><p>  It cannot be a case of the dog eating the homework.  It is not acceptable to claim that the system messed up and that it was a systemic problem.  Somebody in the HSE, the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or its predecessor, or all three, messed up by taking his or her eye off the ball.  How did we get to this nod-and-wink culture?  Surely somebody in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - or the Department of Finance, as it was for a large part of the time - was keeping an eye on the money that was been given to the Department of Health, to the HSE, or to the boards of section 38 agencies.  It is not an acceptable answer for very hard-pressed taxpayers, who are preparing to hear details of the HSE's very difficult service plan, to hear that it just happened and it was the culture.  It was the culture, but can anybody be held responsible?  Who is responsible?  I ask Mr. O'Brien to respond first, but I believe the question goes even wider than the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112700014#N01500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385571300,"counter":361,"content":"<p>At the individual level, with regard to whoever was responsible at the time for the governance of each agency, where there is no evidence of any reasonable quality that the necessary approvals existed, it is reasonable to conclude that the necessary approvals did not exist and that therefore someone made the decision to proceed in the knowledge that they did not have the necessary approvals.  The reality is that they have the effective freedom - not the real freedom, but at a practical level they have had the freedom - to do this because they have their own payroll system.  They simply have the capacity to do it.  We are moving, as we discussed elsewhere, to a different type of financial control environment, in terms of the facilities we have, to have a view of transactions of payroll through a shared services environment.

The CRC stated that senior management remuneration was the subject of a comprehensive review in 2009 involving the chairman, other board members of the CRC and senior officials of the HSE.  At the time, it was agreed by the board of governors that a lesser amount be charged to the HSE and that the balance, for employment contractual reasons, would be directly funded by the CRC, the employer.  It was also agreed that, when the posts concerned fell to be replaced through retirement or resignation, the salaries of the incoming replacements would be discussed and agreed with the HSE.  This agreement took effect from 1 January 2009 and continued up to the CRC's statement in June 2013.  The only changes that have affected the agreed rates since 2009 have been the salary reductions imposed on 1 January 2010.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112700016#P01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geraldine Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1385572500,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I am unaware of any profit making in CRC, but I have been asked to look into it.

I will ask the clerk to do so.<\/p><p>  Regarding the other section 38 organisations that have not responded or to which the HSE is writing, it should be made clear by this committee that we have serious concerns about the situation.  We are also concerned that they have not responded within a reasonable time to the queries that the HSE has put to them.  This is simply not acceptable to the organisation immediately responsible for what is happening, or to us as the committee that must examine the situation.  It would be in their best interests to respond comprehensively to the queries the HSE has raised with them and to the queries that they have undoubtedly heard from members today so that we can clarify matters and, as members have stated, try to restore some confidence among those who support them in a voluntary and financial fashion.  I would like to see a lot more co-operation.  We will meet the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss how the matter has been managed over the years, because it is simply unsatisfactory.  It took Deputy Ross, for example, to give us the information on the payment made to the CEO that amounted to &euro;266,000 when one includes the top-up money and the pension contribution.  That is unacceptable.  It also important for us to point out here that the control environment was seriously inadequate.  I know Mr. O'Brien and his staff are working on the matter and afterwards we will see some sort of conclusion.  <\/p><p>  I do not wish to pick any bones with Mr. O'Brien, but he stated in his opening remarks what was said in the public domain about the report and how it was presented to the committee last week.  The report was presented on 15 March of this year, within his own organisation, to various individuals.  The reason I was concerned about how it was presented to the committee was that the meeting took place on 14 November, so the HSE pondered the report from March until November.  It might have been better if the report had been given to us earlier and properly.  That is my only concern about the matter.<\/p><p>  The HSE's report is very good.  Like what Deputy Ross has said, the HSE should not be afraid of naming names and releasing the figures attached to the names.  Apart from political or media analysis, we would have a fact-based document that contains literally everything from A to Z.  We must strive towards that type of report, which will help everybody.  I thank Mr. O'Brien and his officials for attending here at short notice.<\/p><p>  I wish to refer to two matters very quickly.  I know that the HSE will be very busy between now and Christmas and I may not get another chance to say the following to Mr. O'Brien.  I want to put on record the fact that I raised the issue of reviews and appeals at the last meeting when we discussed medical cards.  I will not reopen the debate, but I want to mention two things.  The person who dealt with reviews and appeals of medical cards looked at me in disbelief and said he did not see how that kind of letter would have gone out.  There were 29 different pieces of correspondence around these medical cards that the HSE deals with.  I want to read into the record of this committee that an applicant was told in a letter that their application could only be reviewed if they had additional relevant information.  This was a case in which all of the information had been given.  Everything had been put before the HSE's medical card section and a review was requested due to the serious nature of the illness of the applicant - who, by the way, has since passed away.  I raise the matter because it caused a difficulty for that particular applicant and their family, because they could not get someone within the HSE to understand that a review was absolutely necessary and urgent.  In case the delegation thinks this was an isolated case, I checked my old files as quickly as I could today and found a second instance in which a review was denied unless relevant information was given.  The applicant had given information from her consultant and doctors, as well as all kinds of personal information.  After dealing with all of the issues raised in the correspondence about medication, money issues and so on, the applicant wrote:<blockquote>So, you are asking for new information.  Well, here it is.  We cannot afford our healthcare and medication without a medical card.  We have cut back on the tablets that our GP says we must take to stay alive.  Our lives may be shortened or abruptly end because of your decision.<\/blockquote>All that person wanted was a review because she believed their cases were urgent because they were not taking their medication.<\/p><p>  I have had to quote these to prove that letters are being issued that give the impression, though possibly not intentionally, that a review can only be considered if there is fresh evidence.  I further stated at the meeting that consultants and doctors were getting annoyed with these patients returning to them asking for fresh proof that was necessary, as if it were needed in either of those cases, to restate their position.  I do not want to reopen the debate on the matter.  I just wanted to clarify that I have the evidence.  I thank Mr. O'Brien's officials for the direct assistance that they have given when we raised such concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112700020#T01600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1385574900,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Is it possible for me to ask a supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112700020#T01700","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1385574900,"counter":530,"content":"<p>If it is short.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112700020#T01800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1385574900,"counter":531,"content":"<p>Yes, it is very short.

Today I will speak on the issue of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland facility in Bahrain, with regard to which Ceartas has committed to taking legal action on international human rights issues from Ireland.  As the RCSI facility in Bahrain awards Irish medical degrees as a result of section 88 of the Medical Practitioners Act, there is an obligation on the Irish Medical Council to monitor and accredit RCSI Bahrain and its programmes of education.  For the purposes of accreditation, the Irish Medical Council has adopted the World Federation for Medical Education standards, also known as the WFME standards, which I will refer to throughout the presentation.  These standards provide a mechanism for quality improvement in medical education and recognise the practical dimensions of medicine and the requirement for hands-on experience in clinical tuition.  Therefore, they demand that the locations of clinical tuition must be safe, appropriate and able to deliver training in the core competencies of medicine, including medical ethics.<\/p><p>  These are the same standards applied to medical education programmes in Ireland.  Many of the human rights abuses documented in Bahrain over the past two years have involved medical personnel and facilities, public and private, utilised by RCSI Bahrain.  As the committee may already know, Dr. Ali Al-Ekri, an RCSI fellow, is one of the medics who continues to serve a prison sentence for what the Physicians for Human Rights termed \"treating protesters and giving interviews\".  From the perspective of Ceartas, there was an overlap between the human rights violations in hospitals and the WFME standards used by the Irish Medical Council.<\/p><p>  I will sum up three major areas of concern that we have identified, much of which is already detailed in our distributed report.  The first is access and provision of health care.  During the Arab Spring protests in 2011, numerous medical personnel were tortured and imprisoned, and today injured protesters and those affected by indiscriminate use of force by the Bahrain authorities fear using hospitals and clinics used by RCSI in the training of students.  We have documented consistent allegations of abuse in this regard, including accounts from reputable sources of patients being picked up from RCSI-utilised hospitals and subsequently tortured.<\/p><p>  The second is a restriction on freedom of expression and matters related to health care.  Medical personnel have consistently reported on a fear of speaking out and I direct the committee to the annexes of our report, showing communiqu&eacute;s instructing doctors to pass information on suspected activists to security forces.  In some cases, patients are vetted before they are treated and doctors who complain of human rights abuses are targeted.  I would be happy to supplement accounts in our report with more ongoing examples that have occurred recently.  In sum, the continuing detention of Dr. Al-Ekri and the targeting of doctors and violations of medical neutrality have all had a chilling effect on the medical system that interfaces with the political system.<\/p><p>  Third, turning to discrimination, the heads of hospitals and clinics have been replaced with doctors from the Sunni sect.  We have also documented how 30 RCSI students were denied work placements simply for being Shia.  The examples are too numerous to mention but they have been documented at length in our report.  For more information on discrimination in access to appropriate health care, I direct the committee to the report of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights on the politicisation of sickle-cell disease, which makes for grim reading; sickle-cell disease mostly affects the Shia population.<\/p><p>  As I mentioned already, the WFME standards adopted by the Irish Medical Council require that the facilities used in clinical tuition should be safe, appropriate and able to deliver on core competencies, including medical ethics.  We submit that the facilities used by RCSI Bahrain are not an environment living up to Irish standards, and these allegations are of such a consistent and serious nature that they overshadow any claims of medical excellence.<\/p> <p> We also wish to highlight the fact that RCSI Bahrain is not immune from the political order that is prevalent in Bahrain at present.  Members might already know that the conference on medical ethics which it tried to organise in association with M&eacute;dicins san Fronti&egrave;res was blocked.  This resulted in the resignation of Professor Tom Collins, the head of RCSI Bahrain, who also confirmed the militarisation of the health care system and the hapless position of RCSI Bahrain in its ability to influence the situation there.  RCSI Bahrain's strategic plan for the next few years fails to mention the unrest that has swept Bahrain and how it has disrupted the health care system, but it has mentioned things such as the economic downturn.  RCSI Bahrain's open days are now sponsored by the Bahrain Defence Force.<\/p><p> With regard to the future, what we consider to be of particular importance to the committee is the fact that until RCSI's education programme is evaluated by the Medical Council, the use of Bahraini hospitals is deemed to be approved by section 88 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  This undermines the integrity of Irish standards and Irish medical degrees.  The Medical Council taking a stance in line with international standards should not be done in an <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i>fashion.  The Medical Council should proactively embrace these standards and apply them as it would in Ireland.  This is explicitly required under the Medical Practitioners Act.<\/p><p> In terms of recommendations for action, we respectfully suggest that the committee recommends to the Minister for Education and Skills that RCSI Bahrain falls short of Irish accreditation standards and that this situation prompts appropriate action in accordance with the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  Likewise, the committee should bring to the Minister's attention the adequacy of other streams of Irish accreditation, including the National University of Ireland and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  We urge the committee to invite the Medical Council to explain how it intends to approach the accreditation of RCSI Bahrain and the human rights concerns affecting the sites of clinical tuition used by RCSI Bahrain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700003#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gear&oacute;id &Oacute; Cuinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385558100,"counter":570,"content":"<p>This is a very serious issue and the committee should be concerned about it.  It not only affects the reputation of the RCSI in Bahrain and here, but also the reputation of Irish education.  Education is something we are trying to market to other countries and its reputation should not be in doubt.  The witness has made the main points.  I was in Bahrain with an Irish delegation of doctors, human rights activists and others two years ago and heard the testimonies the witness mentioned.  Students told us that in previous years all members of the graduating class would automatically get a placement in a state hospital so they could complete their professional training.  However, after the protests that took place during the Arab spring in Bahrain, a distinction is now being made on sectarian grounds between the students.  It should be a matter of extreme concern to us that an Irish institution would be involved in that type of practice.<\/p><p>  There is also the resignation of Professor Tom Collins.  He is an incredibly well respected academic in Ireland as a result of his work on the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, the Curriculum Advisory Council and other bodies.  Having visited Bahrain, he resigned from that position and said he was not satisfied to continue in it given the human rights context.  We should take that very seriously.  It is appropriate for the committee to express its concerns on this issue and ask that they be examined.  It is alarming that matters are just getting worse daily in Bahrain.  There are also wider issues surrounding medical neutrality and so forth.  Amnesty International, the European commissioner for human rights and various groups have expressed concerns that Irish trained medical personnel such as Dr. Ali Al-Ekri and others who trained in Dublin as part of the RCSI training were arrested in Bahrain simply for treating injured protestors and for expressing concern and anger on television at the fact that people had been shot in the back of the head and so forth.  They were rounded up and arrested for that reason and they are still in prison.<\/p><p>  I thank Dr. Gear&oacute;id &Oacute; Cuinn for making this presentation.  It is appropriate for this committee to express concern about an Irish institution being under such a dark cloud with regard to the human rights and particularly the safety of its students.

Just because something is happening a long way from Ireland does not mean we should wash our hands of it; far from it.  The basic civil rights of the doctors in question must be supported and we must do everything we can to do that.  I support the call that this committee do that in the ways that have been suggested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700004#G00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385558100,"counter":572,"content":"<p>We welcome the support.

Organisations such as M&eacute;dicins sans Fronti&egrave;res, Physicians for Human Rights and, critically, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture cannot get into Bahrain, so how do we know what is happening within the facilities and whose word do we take on this?  One of the problems we have discovered as well is that documenting the abuses is getting more difficult.  We recently participated in a campaign called End Impunity which finished two days ago.  Some of the members we worked with have subsequently been arrested.  Others have gone into exile, including Yousif Saif who is the head of documentation for the Bahrain Center for Human Rights.  We believe the violations will soon become invisible, but that does not mean they are not ongoing.  There must be an effort by the Medical Council to systematically find out what is happening.<\/p><p>  Lastly, with regard to what we have seen from RCSI senior staff who have commented in the Irish media, I have given members of the committee copies of some news items.  News item No. 2 refers to extremely anecdotal evidence of their awareness of what is happening in the facilities.  They quote what they have heard from some of their medical students, but we have heard nothing.  What we have documented is that people are afraid to speak out, especially students who have invested so heavily in their medical careers.  Something programmatic must be done to ensure that Irish standards are really being maintained in this essentially hostile environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700004#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gear&oacute;id &Oacute; Cuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1385558100,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Liston wish to add to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700004#G00500","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385558100,"counter":574,"content":"<p>It is important to stress the legislative context here.

This was pulled in mysterious circumstances after an e-mail had been sent to staff and students.  After Professor Tom Collins resigned, there has been a silence on the issue.  It cannot even have a conversation on medical ethics.  What does it say about the position of doctors who are in hospitals and people who are being trained on medical ethics?

If one hands out Irish degrees, they need to live up to those standards, to which the Bahrainis have consented.

Will they be factored into their analysis as they should be in accordance with the World Federation for Medical Education standards that have been adopted by the Medical Council for Irish degrees?  Standard 8.5 on page 11 of our report relates to basic medical education.  It states: \"The medical school must have a constructive interaction with the health and health related sectors of society and government.\"  It also refers to appropriate supervision and a safe environment.  On page 14 of our report we have listed all of the WFME standards that require free and open communication for feedback, complaints and reviews.

In October 2013 the Minister for Education and Skills published a framework for the junior cycle which set out the planned reform of the junior cycle in post-primary schools.  It builds on proposals developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment that were published in November 2011.  The framework has been the subject of much comments since its publication.  Earlier in the year we had a meeting with the History Teachers' Association of Ireland and examined the history aspect of the reforms.<\/p><p>  Three delegations are present to discuss the framework.  I welcome Ms Sally Maguire, president, and Ms Moira Leydon, assistant general secretary, ASTI; Mr. Des Hogan, acting chief executive, and Ms Fidelma Joyce, senior human rights awareness officer, Irish Human Rights Commission; and Mr. Chris Macey, head of advocacy, and Ms Maureen Mulvihill of the Irish Heart Foundation.

This is not ASTI's first time to address the committee on the subject of the junior cycle framework, but this is a critical time for its implementation.<\/p><p>  ASTI has been engaged in a continual process of consultation with teachers on the issues arising from the framework for the past year.  As a result of recent talks on the Haddington Road agreement, we have secured the formation of an implementation group.  Last Monday, we held a bilateral meeting with officials from the Department of Education and Skills to outline ASTI's concerns about the framework.  <\/p><p>  The core messages that came back from our consultation was that aspects of the framework are very good for teaching and learning.  Teachers are excited about much of what is in the framework.  They are excited about the nuts and bolts of the framework but when we dug down beyond that, we realised that 50% of ASTI principals said that our schools do not have the capacity to bring in the changes.<\/p><p>  Teachers are also greatly concerned about the framework's assessment and certification model.  The fact that it is exclusively school based does not give confidence to teachers and we need some external benchmark to keep standards up.  The two big issues that concern teachers about the assessment are, first, that Ireland is lucky to have a special teacher-student relationship.  Teachers are very precious about it because they view themselves as advocates for their students.  Teachers do not want that relationship changed into one of judging students.<\/p><p>  The second important issue is that teachers feel that standards may drop or at least will not be consistent because what works in one school may not work in another.  The OECD has always said that all of its evidence showed that Ireland is unique because no matter what school one goes to, a consistent standard of education is delivered across the board.<\/p> <p>If we lose that, we lose so much.  It is a big worry for parents.  We feel there is a widening gap between policy aspirations and the implementation strategy involved in the framework.  That has now become a concern for all of the education partners, including management bodies, staff and unions.  All of the education partners are now saying the same thing, namely, that we are not ready for the implementation of this framework.  This is a huge culture change for teachers and to suggest that it can be done in one day, which is what the Department is proposing, and in advance of the English subject specifications coming in, is absolutely ludicrous.<\/p><p> We feel that what is needed is whole-staff training, in order to get across this cultural change to teachers within their own schools.  It is really unfair to expect English teachers to attend in-service training and to be the carriers of that training to the rest of the staff.  They should not be expected to have to explain a whole new way of teaching and learning to their colleagues.  <\/p><p> We would like to see the deferral of at least some aspects of the framework until such time as teachers have confidence in it, believe in it and believe they can do it.  They want to do it but they want to do it right, and right may not mean right now.  On the issue of assessment, we feel that assessment is central to education but it is not the only or even the major tool for improving the quality of learning.  OECD evidence indicates that teachers have the biggest impact on student learning and outcomes.  There is a mixture of fear and excitement among teachers but until their fears are overcome, it will not be possible to implement this framework in schools.  We  must get the resources, the training and all that is needed in terms of technology, continuous professional development and so forth right.  This will not happen overnight, in one day or one week - training and professional development must be continuous until the framework is bedded down.  <\/p><p> On the question of technology, we appreciate the fact that there are great moves afoot in the context of broadband availability in schools and understand that new initiatives will be announced next week.  We welcome technological developments and investment.  The new framework has the potential for the greater involvement of  technology in learning.  In that context, ICT equipment must be maintained and a ring-fenced budget must be put in place for schools to allow them to keep their ICT equipment up to date and to pay experts to look after it.  Teachers are not techies, in the main.  ICT systems break down and if we are moving in the direction of using ICT systems more, we need to have the backup in place.  Even with enhanced broadband availability, some schools do not have the capacity to utilise it because their ICT systems are so old.  That issue must be dealt with.<\/p><p> The most important point is that this framework will not work without teachers on board.  We need to move forward, bring teachers along and enable them to believe in the framework.  We must give them the facilities and supports they need so that they will believe in it.  Then it could be something really new and exciting in education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700005#H02800","nonspeaker":"Ms Sally Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385559300,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I now invite Mr. Des Hogan to make a presentation on behalf of the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700006#J00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385559300,"counter":609,"content":"<p>The Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, is delighted to have been invited here today to speak about the new junior cycle programme and, in particular, civic, social and political education, CSPE.  The IHRC was established under statute in 2000 to promote and protect the human rights of everyone in the State and as a direct product of the Good Friday Agreement.  The commission is recognised as Ireland&rsquo;s National Human Rights Institution, NHRI, under the United Nations Paris Principles.  Committee members may be aware that the commission will shortly merge with the Equality Authority to form the new enhanced Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.<\/p><p>  One of the commission&rsquo;s functions is to monitor and review the State&rsquo;s compliance with its human rights obligations including education that strengthens human rights.  The scope of human rights education in post-primary settings was examined by the IHRC in \"Human Rights Education in Ireland &ndash; An Overview\", a report published in 2011 and launched by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  One of its main findings was that CSPE is by far the most explicit form of human rights education in the curriculum. <\/p><p>  First, the commission would like to welcome certain aspects of the new junior cycle programme, including the introduction of portfolio-based assessment, greater choice with short courses, the human rights-oriented statements of learning and the focus on literacy.  However, for such measures to work there must be a clear implementation strategy, meaningful revision of subject syllabi, sufficient initial and in-service teacher training and subjects such as CSPE must remain State examinable. <\/p><p>  The thrust of our presentation today concentrates on the proposed removal of CSPE as a compulsory State-examinable subject to be replaced by a short course within the new junior cycle programme.  Currently, CSPE is the only explicit opportunity available to all students in Ireland to experience learning that equips them for what the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child describes as &ldquo;a responsible life in a free society&rdquo; as active, participatory citizens.  Consequently, the IHRC is of the view that CSPE should remain a compulsory State-examinable subject, as it clearly demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with its international obligations in this field.  Efforts to mainstream human rights values in other subjects should be complementary to and build on CSPE.<\/p><p>  The rationale for retaining CSPE as a mandatory State-examinable subject can be set out under a number of principles.  First, its retention as a mandatory subject would assist the State to demonstrate how it is meeting its obligations to provide education that strengthens human rights.  It could form the cornerstone on which to integrate human rights into other subjects. <\/p><p>  Second, CSPE promotes active citizenship based on human rights.  A subject on citizenship has been a compulsory part of the post-primary curriculum since the then Minister for Education, Donogh O&rsquo;Malley, introduced civics in 1966.  The subject has evolved since then to meet changes in society and how we view ourselves in the world.  CSPE has its origins in the UN Decade for Human Rights Education from 1995 to 2004, as is evident in its stated aim, which is to provide students with the knowledge and skills for active participatory citizenship based on human rights, enabling them to critically question, have empathy and engage with the world around them.  Research demonstrates that because of the action project component of CSPE, young people are engaging more with the world around them and human rights themes are some of the most popular topics addressed.<\/p><p>  The 2007 task force on active citizenship recommended the expansion of education for citizenship in the school system and specifically recommended the strengthening of the role of CSPE in that regard.  The re-designation of CSPE as non-compulsory would mean that citizenship education would not be available to all students for the first time since 1966.  The positive impact of CSPE is revealed in international research.  In an international civic and citizenship study of 14 year olds across 38 countries, Ireland ranked seventh out of the countries studied, with its final score substantially ahead of the international average, due in no small part to the fact that CSPE is mandatory and State examinable.  This research is backed up with evidence from the United Kingdom that suggests that a strong citizenship education subject in the curriculum is the most effective way of promoting equality, human rights, democracy and social justice within the curriculum.<\/p><p>  Third, CSPE supports responses to diversity in schools.  Ireland is an increasingly diverse society, which brings many challenges.  There has been an active response by successive Ministers of Education to promote diversity in education through the development of Traveller culture, inter-cultural and homophobic bullying guidelines.  The CSPE curriculum provides the space for schools wishing to respond positively and effectively to cultural and other forms of diversity, and to move this State towards becoming a truly inter-cultural society.  <\/p><p>  Fourth, CSPE provides a space to address sensitive issues.  The active methodologies of CSPE, supplemented by continuous professional development, support teachers and students to address issues and confront attitudes and behaviours that conflict with human rights and equality principles.  Often it is in school that we first learn about and are able to confront such attitudes and behaviours.<\/p><p>  Fifth, CSPE increases political and social literacy.  The emphasis on improving literacy in the new junior cycle is very welcome.  We concur with the view that an important aspect of CSPE is its ability to students to acquire a level of political literacy necessary for accessing democratic society and to demystify political systems, to provide both the language and the skills needed for democratic participation.  The removal of CSPE as a compulsory subject could deprive students of the opportunity to develop strong political and social literacy.  CSPE is also a foundation for the new subject, politics and society.  The gap in the senior cycle for a subject that addresses philosophy, politics, democracy and human rights, equality, and global interdependence was finally addressed after more than eight years of good consultation and deliberation, with the development of the very exciting and much anticipated politics and society subject.  While science is the foundational subject for students in the junior cycle who wish to branch out in to biology, physics or chemistry in the senior cycle, from a humanities perspective, the curriculum of CSPE is an important foundation for politics and society.<\/p><p>  Sixth, CSPE makes a vital contribution to the development of a whole-school approach.  The IHRC considers that realisation of the full potential of the CSPE curriculum is supported by a whole-school approach.  School councils and other such representative spaces give young people the opportunity to participate in decision-making and enables them to put into practice the principles of human rights and democracy fostered in the CSPE curriculum. <\/p> <p> Finally, CSPE allows for the views of young people to be expressed, heard and taken into account, which is a key requirement of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  When young people were consulted on the junior cycle reform, they said they wanted CSPE to be restructured, taught differently and given more time.  It is worth noting that CSPE and SPHE were two of the subjects that young people considered should be compulsory at junior cycle.<\/p><p> The Irish Human Rights Commission recommends that CSPE should remain as a compulsory State-examinable subject in the new junior cycle programme.  Ireland has an obligation under international human rights law to provide education on human rights to children here.  CSPE is currently the only component of the post-primary curriculum that explicitly meets Ireland&rsquo;s commitments in this regard.  CSPE lessons provide the only opportunity available to every student in Ireland to experience learning that equips them as active participatory citizens that will forge the more caring, rights-respecting, equal and democratic society to which we all aspire.  If the State proceeds to render the subject non-compulsory, it must be in a position to demonstrate how it proposes to adequately meet its international obligations under these conventions.  In the absence of clear defensible evidence to this end, the State will be seen to be retreating from its human rights commitments in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700006#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385559900,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Chris Macey to make a presentation on behalf of the Irish Heart Foundation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700007#K00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385559900,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to discuss our concerns about the proposed changes to the junior cycle framework as they relate to the physical education, PE, curriculum.  The Department currently recommends that students receive two hours of PE each week over the three-year junior cycle.  Under the new proposals, PE will become an optional short course and-or part of the \"other learning experiences\" section of the curriculum.  This means PE might not be offered at all by some schools.  In schools that continue PE classes, the amount of time spent on them over the three-year cycle will be cut from the current 198 hours to just 100 hours.  That means the Department is planning to cut the amount of time spent on PE by half at a time when the childhood obesity crisis is spiralling out of control, which has obviously been the subject of a great deal of discussion at this forum.<\/p><p>  A recent study showed that at present, before any change has been made, just 10% of secondary school pupils receive the minimum recommended PE time.  A quarter of the 5,000 children surveyed as part of this study are unfit, overweight, obese or have elevated blood pressure.  In that context, we have to ask how on earth it will benefit these young people to cut the amount of time designated for PE almost in half.  EU comparisons also paint a bleak picture of our performance in this regard.  Ireland is the only EU member state in which PE is not compulsory.  With an average of just 77 minutes a week being spent on PE at secondary level, our secondary provision record places us near the bottom of the EU league table.  As I have said, a fraction of pupils receive the minimum recommended time.  The average amount of time spent on PE in our primary schools - just 46 minutes a week - is the third lowest in the EU.  The only conclusion we can draw from those statistics is that we are already abjectly failing our young people when it comes to PE.  In all probability, things are about to get a lot worse.<\/p><p>  It is clear that the proposals with regard to PE time breach various Government policies, particularly the cross-Government framework for health and well-being, known as Healthy Ireland.  This policy, which was launched by the Taoiseach in April, includes a commitment to fully implement the PE programme in primary and secondary schools.  That means that pupils in secondary schools should get at least two hours a week of PE classes.  The most innovative and possibly the most important element of Healthy Ireland is the commitment to deliver, for the first time, a whole-of-Government approach to health in this country.  This should involve health imperatives being factored into every policy of every Government Department.  Any downgrading of PE would represent a failure on the part of the Department of Education and Skills to live up to this crucial goal.  Apart from our specific concerns with regard to PE, it would have wide implications for a flagship Government health policy.  I ask my colleague, Ms Mulvihill, to complete our presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700007#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385559900,"counter":613,"content":"<p>The committee is well aware of the facts surrounding Ireland's obesity crisis.  Ireland has one of the highest proportions of overweight children in the EU.  The figures are alarming.  One in four three year olds, one in four primary school children and one in five teenagers is overweight or obese.  These figures mean that the problem of obesity is likely to continue to be a challenge at post-primary level well into the future.  Physical activity plays a vital role in combating obesity and cardiovascular disease, which is still the leading cause of death in this country.  That is why we have a huge interest in this topic.<\/p><p>  PE is a key component of physical activity for young people.  It allows children to develop the necessary physical literacy skills and knowledge to lead healthy and active lifestyles for life.  The Growing Up in Ireland study shows that there is a link between being physically active and maintaining a healthy weight.  Thirteen year olds who took more exercise were less likely to be overweight or obese.  Some 36% of post-primary pupils do not take part in extra-curricular school sport, which is another component of physical activity and is central to the school curriculum in so far as it relates to PE.  Those who do not take part tend to be pupils from lower social classes and older pupils.<\/p><p>  As members will be aware, the national guidelines on physical activity for young people recommend that they should have 60 minutes of such activity each day.  Just 12% of post-primary pupils achieve this.  Ironically, a similar percentage of students - 10%, in this case - are in classes that meet the current PE guidelines in schools.  It is important to stress that physical activity benefits young people socially and emotionally, as well as physically.  The links to mental health, development of self-esteem and social skills cannot be over-estimated in the current climate, where concerns about the mental health of our young people are high.<\/p><p>  Evidence is increasingly emerging that being sedentary, for example, due to sitting in a school classroom for over six hours, is an independent risk factor for health.  The important thing is to break the sedentary time with activity, ideally as frequently as possible.  Unfortunately, the opportunity to be active inside and outside school is diminishing due to environmental influences, such as increased motorised transport to and from school, due to issues of safety and due to a lack of facilities inside and outside school that can be used for activity.  Young people's learning and leisure opportunities are now more sedentary by virtue of the influences of television, the Internet and social media.<\/p><p>  All of this makes PE more important than ever.  That is recognised by the obesity task force.  As Mr. Macey has mentioned, that was also recognised in the Healthy Ireland framework.  It is ironic, therefore, that the proposed new junior cycle framework is recommending that PE should have shorter hours.  How will the new PE framework meet the greater needs of disadvantaged pupils and older girls, who are less likely to take part in sport?  In the specific case of girls, we know that minutes of PE influence levels of physical activity.  We have excellent data on the need for young people to engage in physical activity and PE.  We should be using that data to guide us.<\/p><p>  For 20 years, the Irish Heart Foundation has worked with schools to support the teaching of PE at primary and secondary levels.  We have done this because physical inactivity is a major risk for heart disease and stroke.  It is in the same category as smoking, high blood pressure and cholesterol.  I have outlined the relationship between physical inactivity and obesity.  The foundation has a track record in this area.  Our only interest is the health of our young people.  In our view, the new junior cycle framework does not recognise the importance of PE not just for health, but also for learning and cognitive function.  There is increasing evidence of the importance of PE in this respect.<\/p><p>  We contend that the reduced status given to PE in the new framework, as an optional short course and-or one of the \"other learning experiences\", means it is likely that fewer students will take PE.  We urge the Department of Education and Skills and indeed this committee to reconsider this decision.  We would like to see schools provide core PE following the junior cycle PE curriculum.  Perhaps this could be positioned under the \"other learning experiences\" section of the new framework.  We suggest that this would not be assessed, but that an additional short course on PE which would be assessed could also be offered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700007#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maureen Mulvihill"},{"type":"speech","time":1385559900,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Mulvihill to wrap up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700007#K00500","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385559900,"counter":615,"content":"<p>Our position here today is supported by the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland.

There are a few points I would like developed.  How has the ongoing industrial situation between teachers and the Department affected preparations for the start of the junior certificate reform for English?  What is the position with regard to courses, engagement and so on?  What level of engagement has taken place so far between teachers and the Department in the area of professional training and preparation for the introduction of the English course?  Are we still on course to ensure that is achieved on time for the new junior certificate reformed English curriculum beginning next year?<\/p><p>  Do the witnesses believe that the amount of in-service training that is being discussed and offered by the Department is where it needs to be and is sufficient to ensure teachers are prepared for the new course and are fully engaged with it in order that it starts in the way we need it to?  It is important that the whole reform process starts on a good footing.  The way in which reform of the English curriculum starts and how English teachers react will have a bearing on how teachers down the road will react and on the feedback to other teachers.  If not done properly it could lead to difficulties, and that is not the way to start off.<\/p><p>  I would appreciate a further comment on the issue of independent assessment and the Minister's proposal to move from a State certificate to a school certificate.  I note that for the first couple of years the Minister has indicated that the examination will continue to be set and marked by the State Examination Commission but the overall proposal is that it will move away from the commission.  That is an issue about which I would have serious concerns, having discussed the issue with parents and teachers.  There are genuine concerns in this area.  In asking teachers to mark their students, as such, they are also marking themselves, because it is the result of two or three years work with the students and how one class performs against another.  We must ensure consistency and credibility, within a school to begin with in order that two teachers are not marking separately.  For example, no teacher will want to mark themselves a bit lower.  Everybody will hedge at the higher end in order that their students come out better.  Likewise, schools will want to give themselves the benefit of the doubt in terms of the marking scheme because they will not want a lower marking than other schools.  If we do down that road, it could lead to a situation where the credibility of the junior certificate as a benchmark of standards in the education system is diminished and lost and possibly also the credibility in respect of a student in one school being able to assess his or her marks against another student in another school who sat the same examination.

I have a question for the Irish Human Rights Commission.  In regard to civic, social and political education, CSPE, and PE, schools are critical in terms of how people are set up for life.  Those are two very important skills.  We do a lot on the academic side but the other skills people need are in those two particular subjects.  The History Teachers' Association appeared before the committee in recent months.  It advocated that history should be a compulsory subject.  There are many people who advocate that religion should be a compulsory subject.  If one were to take on board all those one would have, including English, Irish, maths, religion, PE, history and so on, eight subjects out of nine would be compulsory without having a science or language subject.

Do they feel that the new proposed cycle will provide a better holistic education while addressing the issue of providing people for the workforce?  We are making wholesale changes to the cycle but does it mean we will educate our children better?  Is it a step forward or a step backward?  On the question of providing people for the workforce, Mr. Des Hogan mentioned the science phenomenon that if we want people in the IT sector, they must have a basis in science.  If we need people who are good citizens, we need to have civil rights issues addressed.<\/p><p>  I ask all three organisations what level of engagement, if any, they are having with the Department on these issues and whether this is the first engagement with the sector.

I think this document is like a magic show.  It has 24 statements of learning.  That seems to be where it finds its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>.  We have lunatic statements from the OECD that underline that teachers have the biggest impact on classroom learning as if that was some kind of new knowledge when it is fundamental.  That is where the Department should have begun.  Had it begun with that statement, many of the 24 statements of learning would have been contextualised and natural.  Many of my colleagues present would agree with that.  There is an enormous problem with this because when one digs down, one is at Mr. Magic, so to speak.  Ms Maguire is right about the school capacities and capabilities, depending on where they are, the assessment and certification being school-based, the lack of external benchmarks and the lack of consistency.  I would ask the same question as my colleague, namely, how far the witnesses have got with those arguments with the Department.<\/p><p>  There is a massive problem with this plan, and we are hearing it from all the witnesses today and from the CSPE, PE and the History Teachers' Association - I tabled a Private Members' motion about history in the Seanad - and that is the short course element.  Everything is going to be stuffed into a short course.<\/p> <p>We will have the core primary subjects, English, mathematics and Irish, and everything else will be a case of us all being at the market together where we must put out our stall.  I do not believe middle school pupils, 12 to 15 year olds, are able for short courses.  That is a module system that works within universities and with a more mature mind.  It does not work for the young mind.  Already, short courses within the learning programme are brought into schools by staff.<\/p><p> I agree on the importance of CSPE.  More than ever, with the collapse of human rights, we need this subject.  I also completely agree we need PE, as we are part of a couch potato society.  We produced a committee report on this issue and we could fill Croke Park with children under 14 who are overweight.  I cannot express how much I would like to help promote what the witnesses have been saying here today, starting with what has been said by those from the ASTI.  There is a fundamental problem with regard to how this curriculum has been magicked into being and with the 24 reasons for living.<\/p><p> The first paragraph should have been about the power and greatness of teaching.  The reason we have 1 million young people in further education is because of great teaching, from preschool to university.  Subjects must be brought alive by great teaching.

In regard to PE, class time will remain the same, but what we are talking about is non-sedentary study time.  Besides physical reasons, there are strong emotional and social reasons for a strong PE curriculum in our schools.  Physical exercise also plays an important mental health role.  This is an issue at the top of the policy agenda currently, for obvious reasons.  One of the most important ways to assist children's mental health and its development is through physical activity.<\/p><p>  We have an obesity crisis in this country.  I am aware from attending various committees and from watching what goes on in the D&aacute;il that this is an issue that is discussed quite often.  The D&aacute;il has been debating for several years what to do about obesity but has not managed to do anything positive to tackle the problem because of the complexity of the issue.  The issue of fat taxes is complex, as is the issue of the marketing of food for children, because of the power of the vested interests in various parts of the food industry.  It would be easy to implement what we seek.  We are talking about time for PE in schools.  If we cannot do this, we cannot do anything.  We know from research that the time allocated to PE is more important than the facilities in terms of having an effective course and curriculum.  We are not giving the time required to PE.  If we cannot resolve this issue of time for PE, we will not be able to resolve any of the more complex issues.<\/p><p>  A question was asked regarding how far we have got.  We have not got anywhere.

Deputy McConalogue asked about engagement with the Minister.  We wrote to the Minister twice and to the NCCA.  We would like to have had more engagement with the Minister.  As a statutory body, we are there to provide advice to the Government on best practice and how to meet its international and constitutional obligations.  We are also called upon internationally, before UN committees, to give our independent assessment as to how the State is doing.  We have a kind of bridging role and see ourselves as providing advice, to Government primarily, to ensure we are not criticised internationally.<\/p><p>  As we heard in regard to PE, we need to think about what sort of society we are trying to develop.  CSPE introduces students to a variety of areas - equality, human rights, democracy, inclusiveness, diversity, tolerance, and so forth - areas they would not ordinarily cover.  We had a very successful action project last year.  We also had a folder exhibition, which was launched by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  Quite a number of the contributions from students talked about how the issue of human rights affects them in their local area, issues such as the right to be safe, the right to own property and issues we do not normally associate with this area.  CSPE opens up these issues and, with increasing diversity in schools, it allows for discussion of the sort of person we want children to become.  Do we want them to understand about homophobic bullying, Traveller inclusiveness or same-sex inclusiveness?  Do we want them to develop a tolerance and understanding and embracing of diversity or do we want to have students who do not understand or who have never come across these concepts?  This is the core question for us.   If we do not make CSPE compulsory, these issues will not be a compulsory part of the curriculum.  If I was a member of a UN committee and asking questions of Ireland, I would be asking it to show me what it had done and how it had replaced one thing with another and made the system better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700009#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Hogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385561100,"counter":628,"content":"<p>There are a few points to make regarding the compulsory aspect of CSPE.  The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Convention on the Rights of the Child speak of a state's need to provide education that strengthens human rights.  The committee on the convention on the rights of the child went even further and looked at what this involves.  It said it is about more than knowing the facts about human rights and is about living and experiencing human rights in one's daily life.  A big part of a child's daily life is the child's school life.  CSPE is a very innovative programme, although it has limitations.  We have always been concerned that it is not allocated sufficient hours, that there are timetabling issues, and we have always been concerned by the lack of teacher support.<\/p><p>  That said, CSPE is an explicit example in the curriculum where every student has the opportunity not only to learn about human rights and equality, but to experience them through a creative process - the action project.  This project is unique to CSPE among junior cycle subjects.  CSPE is an excellent opportunity for young people to engage and develop skills and to apply these skills in their daily lives.<\/p> <p>We have introduced a number of different guidelines, such as Traveller culture guidelines, intercultural guidelines and the homophobic bullying guidelines.  All of these guidelines are wonderful, but they need a pitch or a place where they can be teased out and explored.  CSPE provides an excellent opportunity for young people to deal with these issues in a human rights framework, and develop the skills to confront racism and prejudice.  We have seen through our Express Yourself initiative how students are able to deal with these topics and relate a human rights standard to an issue that affects not only themselves but others in the community, such as their parents or grandparents.  It is very important that this is a core subject in order that every student can benefit from a human rights framework.<\/p><p> In respect of the provision of holistic education, we support the fact that the framework is offering a more creative approach.  There is potential with short courses, but we do not see CSPE as a short course.   We see it as a compulsory part of the curriculum where we could have electives that would allow a student to go deeper on a human rights issue, development issue or a sustainable environmental issue.  There are options where the short courses can be supportive to a core course, which is what CSPE is.<\/p><p> We see CSPE, social, personal and health education, SPHE, and PE as intrinsic to a person's mental and physical well-being, and to the development of his or her personality as an active citizen in our society.

Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh asked if it would provide a better education.  One would have to have an open mind, quite frankly.  The outcomes of education are always long-term.  They are not measurable within five or ten years.  They are life-long and that is why education has to be right.  We cannot bring in changes which we are not quite sure will have the desired outcomes.  That is why the ASTI has become so agitated over the framework.<\/p><p>  There are many positive aspects in the framework and it would be foolish to deny that.  It is premised upon developing a junior cycle education which reflects the extraordinary changes in the world, in our societies and in the way we live as individuals in social communities.  We are asking that we be listened to.  We have 20, 30 or 35 years of daily pedagogic experience with young people and we are very concerned about certain matters.  There is unanimity within the second level education partners - the management bodies, the principals and the teachers - that our system is not ready for this exponential change just right now.  The ASTI is requesting a deferral of certain aspects of the framework, specifically the introduction of English as a completely new subject in September 2014.<\/p><p>  We also have deep reservations about the assessment and certification model.  I think they have been clearly explained.  Assessment must support learning and not just test learning.  The current proposals in the framework, which include no provision for an external benchmark or quality assurance process, are deeply flawed.  This does not engender confidence among teachers.  It certainly will not engender confidence among parents, who are thinking of the progression of their children to senior cycle and the high stakes leaving certificate and so on.  We must have an open mind, but we would like committee members to listen to the practitioners.  We know the outcomes will not occur tomorrow, but in ten or 15 years time when we reflect on our experience.<\/p><p>  To answer Senator O'Donnell's question, it is a very complex package.  The framework is probably the most complex educational package to be put before the education community and policymakers in decades.  For that reason, we ask that this be taken slowly.   It is very complex.  It is not just about assessment and short courses.  It is about bridging the transition from primary to secondary level.  It is about key skills and about developing competencies beyond the cognitive to enable young people to be the resilient, open to learning young people we want and need them to be.  By virtue of that very complexity, it is very difficult for teachers to get to grips with it.  The difficulties that have been highlighted by committee members are exactly like what is experienced in the staffrooms.  The teachers are asking the Minister to hold on for a moment, to listen to them and to engage with them.  Much of the rationale for the negative reaction of the ASTI members to the Haddington Road agreement proposals was driven largely by the sense of having policy after policy pushed on us without taking our legitimate concerns into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700010#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon"},{"type":"speech","time":1385561700,"counter":631,"content":"<p>Before I make some quick comments, I must apologise.  With the way this place works on a Wednesday, we have to be in 14 different places at the one time, and as soon as we get into an interesting discussion, we are told we have to leave.  I will make some comments and I hope the witnesses can excuse me at that point.<\/p><p>  This has been an interesting discussion.  I welcome much of what has been said.  The witnesses have been open minded and have spoken about teachers being excited about elements of what has been proposed.  We must acknowledge that change is needed.  The junior certificate, as it stands, is not relevant to the modern era as we cannot ask 15 year olds to get a certificate in order that they might go out to the workforce with it.  That is an old-fashioned idea.  Some people are failing in the education system, particularly young men.  Many of them fall out in second year of secondary school.  They might not fall out in body and they might still be enrolled, but they certainly are not fulfilling their potential.  Something has to change, not just in the teaching but also in the learning.  That is where we are coming from with these changes.  I take on board what has been said today.  Nothing can happen in education without empowering teachers.  Nothing can happen in education without bringing everybody with us.  I know that from my experience.<\/p><p>  We had the History Teachers' Association of Ireland before the committee, and one would swear from media commentary that we were banning history in every school in the country.  When we dig deeper into the statistics, we find that only 50% of schools in the State have compulsory history at the moment, but 90% of them study history at junior certificate level.  We find that 54,000 students are doing junior certificate history and geography, but twice as many are doing leaving certificate geography than doing leaving certificate history.  Sometimes something is presented and a narrative begins, but when we examine it a little bit more, it does not seem as simple as initially presented.  In respect of the Irish Heart Foundation, what is being suggested will happen would be a negative.  What is the current situation in physical education?  Is it adequate?  Are schools doing it?  I know of second level schools, especially girls' schools, where it seems to be more of an option to opt out of physical education.<\/p><p>  We need to broaden the argument about obesity.  We need to start talking about hunger.  One fifth of children in this State are going to school or to bed hungry.  It is not necessarily a resources issue.  It is a chaos, dysfunctionality and lifestyle issue.  That is part of the overall discussion about food, helping our children learn and the lifestyle choices parents and individual families make.  When the witnesses talk about a lack of reaction on the part of the political system to that, I point out that we spend more on breakfast and school meals than we ever have before, at &euro;37 million, but part of that is a wider discussion about children coming to school hungry at primary and second level.<\/p><p>  I want to say one thing about the Irish Human Rights Commission.<\/p> <p>Approximately two years ago, I went to many second level schools and talked to junior certificate students who had just done the examination.  They told me that the one subject they had question marks over was civic, social and political education, CSPE.  They enjoyed it but they took the view that not enough time was given to it, that it was not structured enough and that it was not going anywhere.  This was their view, not mine; the subject was not in the system when I was in school.  Anyway, there is great potential for the subject in respect of turning children into citizens and not simply economic units.  I fully agree with the deputation in that regard.  One frustrating aspect of this building is that we discuss the economy and money so much and human beings as economic units.  Really, we should be discussing turning people into citizens.  I accept what the deputation has said about a vehicle or subject like this.  However, as Deputy McConalogue asked, rightly, how does one balance so many different subjects and values within the education system to try to achieve what we want to achieve?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013112700010#N00300","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385562300,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I welcome the panel.  I am sorry I missed the contributions but I was listening to most of what people said on the monitor upstairs.  I compliment the Chair on having this session.  It could not be more timely and it is very much needed.<\/p><p>  I come from this sector.  I like some things about the junior certificate reform proposals.  I like the learning outcome statements relating to developing critical and creative thinkers.  We all agree on that.  I like some of the proposals on continuous assessment.  I have great difficulty, however, with dumbing down a State certificate examination to a school certificate.  The greatest losers will be early school leavers, those who drop out before the leaving certificate.<\/p><p>  Even with the recession, which is keeping more students in school, between one in eight and one in ten students are still dropping out.  We put these young people on the boat to wherever they are going to emigrate.  Their future employers will ask for transcripts from their home school.  This happened to me when I went abroad for college.  All they will get is a school-based report.  This is rubbish.  I started tweeting yesterday about scrapping the school certificate.  What is the view of the panel?  In my view, it is simply reinforcing inequality.  Recently, a teacher put a question to me about the weight of a school certificate from Walkinstown or Ballyfermot versus one from Blackrock or Gonaza College, whether nationally or even internationally.  We know that education is the great equaliser and the route out of poverty.  Why turn all of that back to make it an \"unequaliser\"?  I am keen to hear the views of the panel on that point.<\/p><p>  I have great difficulty with turning early school leavers into children without any State examination.  I know the ASTI has articulated the point on the bias entering into an examination when we are relying totally on inside markers, that is, the teachers themselves.  I propose a mix of keeping the State examination plus local continuous assessment.<\/p><p>  I recognise where the panel is coming from on CSPE because we have the same issue with history.  The panel may not like my asking the question, but we have to find a way to teach everything without overload.  I am studying human rights at the moment and I have a great gr&aacute; for what the panel is saying.  I know what they mean about the hooks for understanding when it comes to rights.  Would the panel consider a merger between history and CSPE?  They are complementary.<\/p><p>  My final question relates to the issue of physical education.  For me, it is a no-brainer that it should remain.  I have one child just out of second level school and another just in second level school.  She is not a natural sportsperson but he was a very natural sportsperson.  I want her to realise and learn that to have a healthy mind one must have a healthy body and that physical exercise is crucial.  We know all the arguments around obesity.  The panel is correct to suggest that the problem has not been cracked in this country, because it is as much about nutrition and lifestyle.

People are being lost in first or second year because they are simply not suited to the junior certificate as it stands.  Either we keep the current system with all the compulsory subjects or we reform it.  There is a move to make history compulsory as well as CSPE, PE, science and geography.  If that happens there will be no reform; we will simply be keeping the current system.  Will the panel comment on that?<\/p><p>  Why does a student need a State certificate at 15 years of age?

The current CSPE curriculum is a much more evolved curriculum.  It deals with a lot of contemporary and relevant issues.  There are issues about its implementation and the Irish Human Rights Commission was the first to raise those concerns.  However, it is a compulsory subject.  We have advocated for a deepening of human rights in the curriculum, to regard CSPE as a cornerstone and to incorporate human rights into any review of other subjects.  For example, history is a very clear example of a subject which can incorporate human rights.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 is a very important document in the historical context.  I refer to the importance of geography and climate change and humanity.  There is a lot of scope to introduce and embed human rights in other subjects.  In our view every young person should have the opportunity, through CSPE, to actually get a basic grounding in human rights and equality and to develop the skills to be active citizens.  The way CSPE is framed with the action project gives students a lot of practical support.  We support any reforms in the curriculum that introduce these kind of active assessments which are not based on rote learning.  We know that more can be done.  It is unclear how a subject which has been compulsory since 1966 and which is subject to a State examination since the late 1990s is now being downgraded to a short course while, at the same time, it is planned to introduce a very exciting subject in the senior cycle called politics and society.  In our view, CSPE should be available for every young person as a basis and a foundation and then they may progress to choose politics and society.

The Minister is well aware that I am critical of the various means by which very profitable corporations reduce their tax liability to the point where they are paying a fraction of the 12.5% headline corporation tax rate.<\/p> <p>While we are all in favour of research and development, I am very concerned at the massive gap between the net amount of tax paid versus the gross profits of, largely, the bigger corporations here.  The tax tables that the Department of Finance provided to me make it clear that while small and medium-sized enterprises pay the 12.5% - there are not many ways out of it for them - there is an enormous gap between the gross profits and the taxable profits of the big corporations such that they end up paying a tiny fraction of the 12.5%.  It is completely unacceptable that these companies and their high-powered accountants can use headings, such as research and development, group losses and trading losses from previous years, to reduce the level of taxable profits such that they end up paying next to nothing.  In that context I worry about giving further opportunities to these corporations to reduce their tax liability.<\/p><p> While I might be alone on this, I find it shocking that we have &euro;70 billion of gross profits declared in this State and only &euro;4 billion in tax, which represents 6.5%.  Regardless of how one massages the figures and talks about accountancy standards, I do not accept it.  I take the point the Minister made last night about closing off some of the tax loopholes that high-earners were using to reduce their effective tax rate.  He pointed out that it was possible to increase the minimum effective tax rate notwithstanding that there are still ways for people to reduce their tax liability, some of which may be legitimate.  Irrespective of all that, it is possible to say that there will be a minimum amount of tax that people will pay if they are high earners.  Exactly the same principle should apply to corporations.  Notwithstanding various incentives or tax breaks for particular activities, we should insist that they must pay a minimum amount before they start to benefit from tax breaks under any category.  That is the least we could do when everybody else in the country is being hammered for increased tax and austerity in one shape or form.  The corporations are getting away scot free and paying a fraction proportionately of what everybody else is paying.<\/p><p> Against that background, I am not happy with this section and others we will discuss later.  These issues need to be discussed, debated and interrogated.

However, his intention may have been to increase the USC exemption threshold of &euro;10,036 to &euro;17,542 per annum.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, there was a specific commitment in the programme for Government to review the USC.  Delivering on this commitment, the USC was reviewed by the Department of Finance in the lead-up to budget 2012 and the report is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  As a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum.  It is estimated this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.<\/p><p>  I should point out the cost of the first part of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment as worded, would be in the region of &euro;648 million for a full tax year.  However, if his intention was to increase the exemption threshold from &euro;10,036 to &euro;17,542, then the cost would be in the region of &euro;132 million for a full tax year and would remove an additional 365,000 individuals from the charge.  This is a significant net cost, particularly in the context of the current budget balance.<\/p><p>  Moreover, increasing the USC exemption threshold to &euro;17,542 would effectively increase the entry point to the charge above the current entry point to income tax of &euro;16,500 per annum for a single employee.  To accept this would be to seriously undermine the rationale for the introduction of the USC, which was to broaden the tax base from its narrow unsustainable level with a relatively small portion of income earners responsible for a disproportionate amount of the overall income tax yield.  In addition, it was to ensure that most individuals would make some contribution, however small, to the provision of services and towards assisting in restoring the public finances.  The removal of an additional 365,000 individuals from the charge would effectively reverse the base-broadening which has already been achieved.<\/p><p>  The second part of the amendment put forward by Deputy Doherty, seeks to provide that individuals aged 70 and over would benefit from a concessionary rate of USC of 4%, irrespective of their level of income.  I should point out that given the budgetary constraints and the need to raise revenue, earlier this year in the Finance Act 2013 the Government decided to amend the structure of the USC for those aged 70 years and over and medical card holders with income in excess of &euro;60,000 per annum, such that the reduced rates of USC would be discontinued from 1 January 2013.  The Government believes this decision was justified and will ensure equity between all citizens with income in excess of &euro;60,000 per annum.  It is also important to point out that payments from the Department of Social Protection, such as the State pension, are exempt from the USC.  Furthermore, such payments will not be taken in to account in determining if an individual has exceeded the &euro;60,000 threshold.  I cannot accept that pensioners earning in excess of &euro;60,000 per annum should benefit from a concessionary rate of USC, while those individuals working and earning the average industrial wage are subject to a USC charge of 7% on their income in excess of &euro;16,016 per annum.  However, it should be noted those aged 70 and over whose income does not exceed &euro;60,000 per annum, excluding social welfare income, will continue to benefit from the concessionary rate of USC.  The Revenue Commissioners estimate the cost of the second part of the amendment would be &euro;26 million.  For the above reasons I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700005#D00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1385547600,"counter":716,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned exempting those earning below the minimum wage from the USC tax net would have the effect of reversing the intention of the USC, which was to broaden the tax base, and also mentioned that the principle of the charge is that everybody should pay something regardless of how small.

He believes 300,000 people should not be paying the charge regardless of how small and so has already accepted the principle there is a cohort of people who, because of their income, should not be subject to the universal social charge.  The battle here is what is the level and what is the group of people to whom the universal social charge should not be applicable because their income is so low.  The Minister has decided the threshold should be approximately &euro;10,000.  In my view it should be &euro;17,542 based on the weekly minimum wage.<\/p><p>  If we consider what the minimum wage stands for, it should be income which is protected and not subject to tax.

It is very unlikely much of the money, because of the income bands of the individuals, would be lost outside the State.  It would be a boost to the real economy.  The question is whether people on the minimum wage should pay the universal social charge and in my view their income should be protected and the charge should apply to those earning above the minimum wage.  The removal by the Minister of 300,000 people from the USC net did not cost anything to the State, or if it did it was only a number of million euro.  While the effect of the measure would have been in the region of &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million, another measure introduced in the same budget ensured the universal social charge recouped the amount lost.  The reason the measure costs money is because those earning between &euro;10,000 and &euro;17,000 pay &euro;132 million in a full tax year.  The total was &euro;94 million in the first year of its application.  It is a significant portion of money for this cohort of people who are some of the most oppressed people in society.<\/p><p>  We have put down a marker in the legislation with regard to the 4% figure.<\/p> <p>That was to remind us of what the Government had been doing to the over-70s.  Last night we voted on Government legislation to reduce their medical card entitlements by reducing the thresholds.  It was the second time such legislation had been introduced by the Government in this calendar year.  As the Minister mentioned, the Government also changed the universal social charge, USC, as it applied to the over-70s.<\/p><p> This relates to last night's motion on equality and impact proofing.  We need an assessment of what cumulative budgets, including USC provisions, are doing to sections of society.  On its merits, the Minister's contribution at this meeting has been justifiable and makes sense.  Why should people avail of a special rate?  However, we must also consider the medical card issue.  When we put everything together, a picture of the Government's targeting of the over-70s can be painted.  When the isolated legislative measures taken by the Ministers for Finance, Health and Public Expenditure and Reform are looked at together, one sees that the incomes and entitlements of a cohort of individuals, as well as the provisions they have enjoyed heretofore, have been subjected to targeting by the Government.  I am unsure as to whether they were entitled to these provisions, but I am sure the Minister stood before the crowd at the gates and supported it in its cause a number of years ago when people were shouting about medical card entitlements being removed by Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am sure he also supported a special USC rate for the over-70s.  This amendment is a reminder that the Government is rowing back on the commitments and provisions the over-70s have enjoyed heretofore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700005#D00300","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385548200,"counter":718,"content":"<p>We all agree with the general thesis that a budget must be fair.  We also all agree that we must be careful when designing budgets to ensure the budgetary burden that is necessary to correct the State's finances is distributed in a fair and equitable way.  On this occasion, rather than targeting the over-70s for any penal imposition, they are again protected by the budgetary strategy.  No cut was made to any pension, be it contributory or non-contributory, and the beneficial income tax credits that apply to the elderly were fully maintained.  There was a deliberate policy choice to ensure the incomes of the elderly were protected in these ways.<\/p><p>  It is reasonable that, if someone has an income of &euro;60,000, as well as welfare payments, for example, a contributory pension, both the pension and the &euro;60,000 are exempt from the USC.  One cannot sustain the argument that people beyond this level of income should have exemptions because they are over 70 years of age when the 65 year old who is still working is paying at the top rate that applies.  There is a rebalancing, but it is not as dramatic as the Deputy claims.  There is no targeting of the elderly in the budget.  As a matter of fact, there were deliberate social welfare and tax policy choices made to protect the incomes of the elderly.<\/p><p>  Regarding the other part of the Deputy's amendment, he is right.  We reviewed the USC and decided that the exemption limit should be just over &euro;10,000.  If one has an income above that figure, one's liability for the USC does not start at &euro;10,036, rather it starts with the first euro.  One pays on the totality of one's income.  There is a debate on where to draw the line, but many of the people whom the Deputy seeks to exempt are part-time workers rather than full-time workers and in receipt of benefits already exempt from the USC.  For example, family income supplement, FIS, is exempt.  One-parent allowances are exempt, as is rent supplement.  Back to school benefits and some other payments are free from the USC.  It is not a question of reaching &euro;10,036 and suddenly having the USC applied to all income.  It is applied to the amount of income one earns at work, be it full-time or part-time.  Income derived from social welfare payments is generally exempt, particularly in the case of the payments I have mentioned.  I agree with the Deputy.  The appropriate level at which to draw the line is a matter of opinion.  We went into this matter in great detail in our first budget after committing in the programme for Government to exempt the low-paid from liability for the USC.  We fixed the threshold at &euro;10,036.  That exempted 330,000 people from the charge.  This was the dramatic move we made in accordance with the programme for Government and I am not going beyond it in this budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700006#E00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1385548200,"counter":719,"content":"<p>That dramatic move cost the State approximately &euro;50 million, but the Government introduced another measure that recouped that amount.  I am referring to the case of an employee employed by two employers or the like.  While the affected individuals saw some value, there would be more substantive value in bringing those earning the minimum wage out of the USC net.  The Minister is right, in that a cohort of individuals are part-time workers and entitled to benefits exempt from the USC.  However, I am also right in saying a number of those exempt following the Minister's dramatic move because they earn below &euro;10,000 are part-time workers and entitled to social welfare payments which are exempt.  That is not a reason not to do this and it is something of which we must be conscious.  As the Minister acknowledged, the real argument is about where the line should be drawn and what income should be protected from the USC.  There is no point in repeating myself <i>ad nauseam<\/i>, as there is a difference of opinion, but that will not stop me from trying to pursue this point on the minimum wage of &euro;17,542.<\/p><p>  The Minister maintains that his budget has purposely protected the over-70s, but I contest that claim.  Let us consider the issue.  I cited the example of the Government last night passing legislation that took tens of thousands of medical cards from the over-70s through a reduction in thresholds.  It was the result of a budget that demanded that the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, find &euro;666 million in savings.  The HSE has stated today that probably twice that amount is necessary.  This is the second time that has happened this year.  During our debate on the Bill yesterday we dealt with the &euro;1,000 threshold for medical insurance.  The budget will affect people who are over 70 years of age.  It may be the Minister's &euro;40 or less, but they will be affected.<\/p><p>  We also dealt with the one-parent tax credit yesterday.  The Minister has acknowledged that grandparents have been receiving the credit if they are the secondary carers, but they will no longer be eligible.  Therefore, a cohort of over-70s will be affected.  We do not know the numbers because they have not been provided.<\/p><p>  The property tax, although not contained within the Finance Bill, formed part of the budgetary arithmetic.  The Minister booked the &euro;250 million that would accrue from that tax.  Obviously, the over-70s are not exempt from paying its full value and they will see a reduction in their disposable incomes in 2014.<\/p> <p>They are the measures we have addressed heretofore.  There are others on the spending side that will impact on the over-70s.  Are the over-70s deliberately being targeted?  Some of the previous measures introduced were very crude, in particular the USC threshold reduction.  The measure we discussed last night is targeted at the over-70s.  This is not a case of changes to medical card entitlement for everybody, rather it is a reduction in the threshold for medical card entitlement for the over-70s.  Countless other measures in the recently announced budget impact on the over-70s.  I accept that they also impact on other sections of society.  If we had equality proofed budgeting, we would not be having this type of debate.  We would instead have an independent assessment of which people were being disproportionately affected, which is the real question.<\/p><p> In terms of the various scenarios I have outlined, in the budget, looked at through the lense of what was introduced in previous budgets by the Government, there has been a particular targeting of the over-70s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700006#E00300","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385548800,"counter":721,"content":"<p>Most of the evidence offered by the Deputy to support his thesis does not prove there has been a targeting of the over-70s.

Before throwing stones about populism and being electoral, the Minister should look to Fine Gael and the initiative taken by it to cover its back in respect of the nastier cuts it directed towards people with discretionary medical cards or the elderly from whom they are being withdrawn.  <\/p><p>  On the universal social charge and where the tax burden falls, while the Minister has stated the Government's position, it is worth putting indicating that at a minimum people earning the minimum wage or less should not have to suffer the impact of the universal social charge which it should be remembered was the defining austerity tax introduced as a result of the crash and decision to bail out the banks.  The idea that those on the minimum wage, a miserable wage for people on which to survive, should not be subject to this austerity tax is the minimum ask.  Some of us would go a lot further.  We proposed in our last two budget submissions that persons earning less than &euro;60,000 be exempted from the USC and that those earning between &euro;60,000 and &euro;100,000 be liable to pay at only half the rate which, according to the Department, would cost in the region of &euro;2 billion.  We proposed that this cost be met by an increase in income tax rates on earnings over &euro;100,000, &euro;150,000 and &euro;200,000.  This proposal is dismissed pretty much out of hand by the Minister and the political establishment.  I put it to him that such a proposal is fair.  Tax collection should be about the fair distribution of income and resources.  There is an ever growing gap between high and low earners and between the rich and the poor.  It seems a progressive budget would seek to close this gap and redistribute wealth in a fair way, in part because this would be fair and also because it would be better for the economy.  Numerous studies and analyses show that more equal societies function better.<\/p> <p>That is something the Minister does not seem to get.  He is not acknowledging the point of a gap between rich and poor, with huge differentials between top and low earners.  That is unfair and corrosive to society and social solidarity.  Ultimately, there is a cost, and issues such as the universal social charge have worsened the position of the less well-off.<\/p><p> There is also the matter of economic growth.  Relieving the burden of taxation in the form of the universal social charge on low and middle income earners would have a far greater benefit for the economy than the approach which the Minister generally seems to favour of giving tax breaks to big corporations or high earners on the grounds that he believes this will incentivise investment.  There is not much evidence that there is any success in this regard, and it is surely self-evident that if the income of those on low and middle incomes is increased, the multiplier effect would be far greater for the economy, as these people will spend the money in local shops and businesses.  For the most part the money would not go outside the country or be used for speculative purposes; it will benefit the economy and generate demand, growth and employment.  The Minister does not really seem to acknowledge or understand that in how the budgets are framed and persists with policies of trying to incentivise the rich and maintain the burden of austerity on low and middle income families.  That is why the economy is not recovering and we are not getting the promised economic growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700007#F02900","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385549400,"counter":750,"content":"<p>With regard to those over 70, that demographic continues to enjoy full contributory and non-contributory pensions, as they were not touched in the budget.

They are exempt from PRSI, and that provision was not touched in the budget.  They are also exempt from deposit interest retention tax for the portion of their income which is below the exemption level, as that provision was not touched in the budget.  All these benefits apply to people over 65, so it is not even just those over 70 who are protected with these measures; there is a general policy of protecting the elderly.

The balance of imposition is certainly towards those with the highest income.  In any comparative table we are very progressive in our income tax and many people are protected.  It is estimated that in 2014, 856,000 individuals representing 39% of the income tax base will be exempt from income tax completely.  The evidence is contrary to the claims made by the Deputy.  His rhetoric is very strong but it is not based in fact.  The top 5% are paying 44% of all income tax and 856,000 individuals in 2014 - or 39% of the income tax base - will pay no income tax whatever.  Those are the facts.

I am concerned about the lack of evidence.  One of the things that section 30 does is increase the fund exit tax for life insurance and investment fund policies from 36% to 41%.  The reason that I oppose it is not necessarily because I disagree with the measure.  I oppose it because there was insufficient analysis to accompany the proposal.  I received useful analysis from the Minister's officials after the briefing session last week.<\/p><p>  My concern is with tax changes, as with those for health insurance policies and the variance changes being made to pensions.  I opposed section 18 of this Bill but unfortunately I had to be in the Chamber last night to take Private Members' time so could not attend this meeting.  <\/p><p>  Section 30 is really complicated.  It contains only one or two straightforward bits such as increasing the tax rate from 33% or 36% up to 41%.  It also includes a bunch of complicated terms such as \"at the rate of 80 per cent\" for \"at the rate determined by the formula&mdash; (H + 33) per cent where H is a rate per cent\".<\/p><p>   I shall outline my reason for opposing the provision.  It is reasonable to assume that there will some behavioural change when things are made more expensive.  For example, if we make health insurance and life assurance more expensive then fewer people will have it.  In this case the Minister's officials have used zero elasticity assumptions and assumed no behavioural change.  In the briefing note that I received there was a valid point made that it is very difficult to come up with an accurate behavioural estimate.  I would much prefer to see an accompanying technical appendix provided for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and particularly for the sub-committee that would allow us to assess the matter.  We know that the Minister proposes to increase the tax from 33% to 41%.  Can we have a few worked examples of how such a provision would change things?  Can his officials estimate the potential behavioural changes?  <\/p><p>  Let us view the matter in terms of pensions.  We had the 0.6% levy that was followed by a 0.15% increase and then changes were made to the standard fund threshold.  There were also more changes.  For example, in the public sector it was changed from final salary to salary average and the defined benefit change meant the multiple increased from 20 up to 37.  Section 30 does not deal with life assurance but the same point applies.  For good or bad reasons a lot of important things are becoming more expensive through taxation and there are fewer taxation deductibles.  Section 30 deals with life assurance and other sections deal with pensions and health insurance.  The accompanying impact analysis has not been supplied.  It would help us to understand the rationale for increasing the exit tax from 36% to 41% and making all of the other complex changes to the calculation.   <\/p> <p>We believe we will see 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 or zero new life assurance policies.  It is a point of consideration for next year's budget.  Interrogating properly the impact analysis of these changes is impossible without the resources of the Civil Service.  I do not know whether I oppose the section because I do not know what the Minister and his officials estimate as the impact of the section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700009#H02400","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385550600,"counter":783,"content":"<p>This section gives legislative effect to the changes announced in budget 2014 of my intention to increase the rate of exit tax applicable to income in gains from investment and life assurance policies and investment funds.  With effect from 1 January 2014, a new flat rate of 41% will apply to income and gains from investment in domestic and foreign life assurance policies and investment funds that comes in the gross roll-up taxation regime.  This is in line with the proposed increase to the DIRT rate in this Bill.  Under the gross roll-up taxation regime, investments may accumulate without the imposition of tax.  However, an exit tax applies when a chargeable event occurs, such as the receipt of payment from, or the disposal of an investment in, the life policy or fund or the ending of each eight-year period following the acquisition of the policy or the units in the fund.  Previously, the rates of tax on these investments varied depending on the frequency of payments to the investor and, in the case of foreign investments, on whether the income or gains were correctly included in the investor's tax returns to Revenue under the self-assessment taxation regime.  The legislation governing the gross-up taxation regime also contains anti-avoidance measures.  Where a payment from an investment held in a personal portfolio life policy or a personal portfolio investment undertaking is correctly included in a tax return to revenue, the tax rate that applies up to 31 December 2013 is the standard rate of tax, currently 20%, plus an additional 36 percentage points.  The rate is being increased to a 60% rate with effect from 1 January 2014.  Second, where payment from investments held in a personal portfolio life policy or a personal portfolio investment undertaking is not correctly included in the investor's tax return, the rate that applies up to the 31 December 2013 is the investor's marginal rate of tax plus an additional 33 percentage points.  That is being increased to 80% with effect from 1 January 2014.  These exit tax rate changes are estimated to yield the Exchequer &euro;12 million in 2014 and &euro;16 million in a full year.  The combined projected additional yield from the increase, and the increase in DIRT, is expected to be &euro;105 million in 2014 and &euro;140 million in a full year.  The policy intent is to ensure there is no distortion in the savings market as a greater imposition is placed on savings, through the increase in DIRT to 41%, and that an analogous impositions should be made on insurance policies for investment purposes.<\/p><p>  I understand that at last week's briefing with officials, Deputy Donnelly asked whether any elasticity had been built into the yield estimates for exit taxes.  The figures used in the budget material for projected yield from the increase was &euro;12 million in 2014 and &euro;16 million in a full year.  From the DIRT increase, we have projected &euro;93 million in 2014 and &euro;124 million in a full year.  The short answer is that the projections do not take into account any behavioural response.  It would be difficult to devise an econometric tool to measure the potential behavioural impact of a tax increase on investment products, particularly in light of the alternative investments available.  Tax should not be the main reason for making an investment.  The security or value of the investment is more important in such decisions.  Life insurance and investment funds are longer term investments so the yield in 2014 is unlikely to be directly affected by an increase in the rate this year.  A person who invests in a life insurance fund in 2014 would not be doing so to obtain a yield from the fund in the current year.  Even if the rate dissuaded the individual from investing in 2014, it will not affect the 2014 exit tax yield, which will be based on the decisions made by individuals investing several years before and on the performance of the investments.<\/p><p>  I take the general point that in complex amendments it is difficult for Deputies to fully assess them or to know whether they are in favour of them.  We will examine that to see whether we can put more information in circulation prior to debates on Committee Stage in future years.

My concern is not the yield although it is the concern of the Minister because he must hit the budget figures.  My concern on this, as with as my concern about changes to DIRT and tax treatment of health insurance, is in respect of behaviour.  I am less concerned about whether the change will bring in &euro;14 million, &euro;16 million or &euro;18 million and more concerned about whether it will turn people off investing their money in Irish investment accounts and beginning to move offshore.  The Minister has to be interested in the yield but I am interested in behaviour.  With regard to health insurance policies, I do not know if any behavioural change has been factored in.  The Minister's officials gave me some useful information suggesting it is pretty inelastic.  Hopefully, there will not be too much behavioural change.  What is more interesting is not whether there is an increased yield of 4% or 2% but whether 10,000 families drop their health insurance policies, which is the wider socio-economic impact.  Perhaps the Minister can do something next year with a technical appendix on elasticity or projected behavioural changes.

I do not have any difficulty with it and I support the initiative.  Looking at the census figures, I see that Limerick city's population declined by 5% in the most recent census.  The population in Cork city has been in decline for a number of years and our policies must be designed to support people coming back and living in town and city centres rather than in peripheral developments.  The Minister is amending the definition of a qualifying property and removing the reference to a Georgian house and defining a relevant house in a more general way.  In this amendment, I raise the matter of whether the Minister is tied to retaining the initiative for owner occupiers only if the purpose is to have people living in these properties and renovated to the point where they are habitable.  Will the Minister examine this point?<\/p><p>  Currently, only properties built before 1915 can avail of the relief.

In regard to the first of these points, I would like to emphasis once again that the purpose of this initiative is to encourage families to come back to live in the centres of these cities.  The Deputy's proposed amendment would completely reverse the intentions behind the initiative.  The suggestion that relief could be granted to someone who is not the owner-occupier would immediately encourage speculators back into the market. This scheme is not intended to appeal to property investors or speculators.  I think even those who do not support the initiative would agree with me on that point.<\/p><p>  In case there is any confusion about this, I should point out that the properties in question do not have to be occupied at the time the renovation work is done - in fact, in many instances they could not be.  A derelict building would have to be made habitable before it could be occupied and the relief would only commence when it is occupied as a residence.  The relief is limited to owner-occupiers.  It does, not nor will it, apply to landlords or speculators in the private rented sector.<\/p><p>  We have seen in the past the difficulties that can arise when tax incentives are provided on a wide-ranging basis.  When I introduced the living city initiative in the Finance Bill 2013, I stated that it was a scheme with a specific purpose, that is, to develop and re-invigorate run-down areas in our city centres.  The scheme was to be targeted at houses more or less on a street-by-street basis and was aimed at attracting families back to city centre locations.<\/p><p>  The second element of Deputy McGrath's amendment is that the owner-occupier relief should be extended to all pre-1915 houses in towns with a population of 10,000 or more.  Consider for a moment what that might mean in practice.  Every pre-1915 house in the city of Dublin could avail of the relief.  Make no mistake, if I acceded to the Deputy's suggestion, relief would be granted to some of the more affluent areas of our cities and towns.  It makes no sense to waste tax expenditures such as this in areas which do not need regeneration.<\/p><p>  This initiative is aimed at urban renewal and regeneration.  We have to target the parts of our cities which are in decline and need help.  That is why we are consulting the local authorities, why we will identify specific areas as being most in need of help, why we are trying to attract families back to these areas and why it is why it is a targeted initiative.  When I announced the initiative in the budget in December last year, I had envisaged that it would target Georgian houses only.  However, following an independent ex-ante cost benefit analysis conducted by my Department which recommended extending the scheme to other types of houses and four other cities, I have decided that the initiative should be available to houses built before 1915 in certain designated areas of our six cities.  The precise areas of the cities will be decided on following consultation with the local authorities and other Government agencies.<\/p><p>  We cannot go back to large-scale property reliefs and any future schemes should always be subject to comprehensive <i>ex-ante<\/i> cost benefit analyses.  That is what we have done in this case and the results of that independent analysis are reflected in the amendments to the initiative set down in this Bill.  For these reasons, I cannot accept this amendment.  <\/p><p>  The initiative must pass muster in Europe before we can apply it but we are now in a position, having done the cost benefit analysis, to process the application before the European Commission.  Things change very rapidly.  If one goes back over our conversations on the last two budgets, many Deputies drew attention to the overhang of property in Dublin, how supply was exceeding demand to such a large extent and how there was such an imbalance in Dublin.  It is the other way around now.  People are advising me there is a supply problem in Dublin.  <\/p><p>  I hope that in Dublin, in particular in the area between the canals, all those red brick houses and streets we know on the northside and the southside of the city could be restored.

The reason for 1915 was that seemingly the First World War brought about a situation where there was very little building.  There is a kind of natural fire break if one picks 1915.  Those administering the scheme will not be getting into arguments about whether the property was built in 1915, 1916 or 1917 because there was very little building in the years following 1915.

I am concerned that the Minister is extending a scheme which is not up and running.  It is not that there has been no take-up, as Deputy Timmins mentioned.  There cannot be a take-up because we have not given effect to the scheme in last year's Finance Bill as we have not received approval from the EU, or did not made an application until the cost benefit analysis was done.  However, we have decided not only to extend the scheme to four different regions but have decided to substantially change the nature of the scheme.  The number of properties eligible to come under this scheme has changed substantially.<\/p> <p>I am not sure what areas of Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin the Minister intends to designate for this scheme.  I presume that has not been worked out with the local authorities yet.  What areas are being considered?  Will it be the northside or the southside?  The decision on which parts of the city centres will be designated is being left up to the Minister.  <\/p><p> It is necessary to include provisions in finance Bills that will create economic activity.  We must take risks but we must do so on the basis of the best evidence available.  If this is a pilot scheme, it should be allowed to run as a pilot scheme.  The cost benefit analysis that has been done in terms of the impact on employment, urban renewal, property values in designated areas, business activities and so on, was derived from surveys of auctioneers, residents and retailers.  I presume that cost benefit analysis was done in the context of the original scheme, which was for Georgian houses.  Now that we have changed the scheme substantially, by opening it up to pre-1915 buildings, other issues arise.  Will the European Commission be happy with that change?  We must examine the details of the scheme closely.  It gives 100% tax relief for the cost incurred in the refurbishment or conversion of eligible properties, subject to the individual having a tax liability of that amount.  It is very lucrative, therefore, for property owners with relatively high incomes. <\/p><p> I agree with the Minister that when one walks through the aforementioned cities one sees many neglected buildings.  However, the same is true of many towns and villages.  Should the scheme be extended to every town and village?  In the villages of Pettigo and Mountcharles in my constituency, for example, there are many boarded up houses.  In Pettigo, which is on the Border, there has been some renewal with refurbishment of shops and pubs and the opening of a new community centre.  The villagers are doing their best to keep the spirit of the place alive but there are lots of boarded up houses there.  The same is true in many other towns and villages across the country.  There is an issue of fairness here.<\/p><p> The Minister has said that he is not opposed to the extension of the scheme if it works and then it could apply to places like the main street of Letterkenny, the lower half of which contains many boarded up buildings, as well as many other towns across the State.  Then we could end up with a scheme which provides enormous tax reliefs for property development in the centre of cities, towns and even villages.  I am not sure about this.  I think we should go down this road very carefully.  We have been here and done that.  We have looked at incentives such as this in the past, although that is not a reason not to look again, reshape them and remodel them to the needs of today.  However, we must tread very carefully.  I do not understand the urgency about expanding the scheme to the six cities that have been identified.   We do not know what areas of those cities will qualify.<\/p><p> I see the rationale for the pre-1915 condition and believe it is fairer than restricting the scheme to Georgian houses.  That said, the Minister must tread very carefully.  I would not be supportive of jumping in with both an expansion of the scheme and an expansion of the qualifying criteria before the scheme has been up and running and its impact has been assessed properly.  There is no urgency about this.  It will be limited in its scope in terms of the areas that the Minister designates, most likely the city centre areas.  While the scheme will not apply to a large number of properties, it is very lucrative and for that reason, I would tread more carefully than the Minister is currently doing.  We should not be expanding a scheme that does not even exist at this point in time.  It is for these reasons that I am opposed to this section of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700011#K01000","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385551800,"counter":799,"content":"<p>We are proceeding very cautiously.  When I introduced this last year, I explained that it was subject to assessment under State aid rules, that we would have to make an application to Commissioner Almunia and that the Commission would require a cost benefit analysis before the submission could be made.  We are expanding the scheme because the cost benefit analysis recommended specifically that it would be extended from the two cities that were announced last year to all cities.  The reason for this was that the analysis showed that the uptake would be very small if the scheme was confined to Limerick and Waterford.  In order for the scheme to work, it would have to be extended to the other cities.  These are the cost benefit analysis recommendations.  I published the cost benefit analysis on budget night.  It is available to Deputy Doherty if he wishes to examine the rationale for what we are doing here.<\/p><p>  I accept that the scheme is lucrative but only to owner-occupiers who are willing to move themselves and their families into city centre locations.  It takes a certain amount of courage to be the initiator of something like that.  It is called the Living Cities initiative.  One only has to leave Leinster House, walk through Grafton Street and keep going and one will get to the area around the former Meath Hospital and Synge Street, which is now being renewed.  If one continues on up the South Circular Road as far as the canal, one will see that a lot of properties have been restored.  A lot of the property in those areas is pre-1915 and much of it has a lot of potential.  Many of those older red-brick houses would be very suitable for young families.  The infrastructure is already in place, in terms of schools, shops, churches, public transport links and so on.  I would hope that some of those areas could be designated.  <\/p><p>  In terms of the designation, our next step is to get the consent of the Commission and following that, we will consult with the local authorities regarding the areas to be designated for the scheme.  No specific areas have been designated as yet.  I will take Deputy Doherty's views into account.<\/p><p>  I hope this works.  The primary motivation for the home extension scheme which we discussed yesterday is to stimulate activity in the construction sector and to get construction workers off the live register.  The primary motivation here is to revitalise areas of cities that were vital in the past but which have gone downhill recently.  The objective is not to aid the construction industry but to get people back into city centre locations, living there, rearing their children there and sending them to the schools that now have empty classrooms because so many people have moved to the outer suburbs.  The objectives here are social more than economic.  We will have to wait and see how it works.  There is a long lead-in time and it will be a while yet before we will be able to evaluate it.  We are proceeding very cautiously.<\/p><p>  I would ask the Deputies to study the cost benefit analysis to get a better understanding of the reasoning behind this extension.

A pilot scheme should be narrow to allow us to test the waters, identify loopholes and fix them and then, if need be, we can broaden it out.  We have not tested the waters yet, which is my main concern.  I have also specific concerns about conversions.

In such circumstances, a person could spend &euro;100,000 having a house converted and subsequently have the entire sum written off his or her tax bill over a ten year period.

People will take this option and given that guidelines come after the fact, Deputies are not in a position to evaluate what is the intention of the measure or how restrictive it will be.<\/p><p>  I accept it is not intended that the scheme will be open to abuse.  The decision to extend the scheme for Georgian houses introduced in last year's Finance Act to pre-1915 houses creates a greater risk of abuse.

These banks were making astronomical profits during the boom, but we got practically nothing from them because corporate tax here is so low.  They then caused the economy to crash because of their greed and nefarious activities.  We stepped in and pumped vast amounts into them, crippling our economy in the process.  Now, we prepare to launch them back into the market so that when they become profitable again, we will get nothing from them.  What we are doing is fattening up the golden goose for private investors to come and grab it.

We get the banks when they are crippled, yet the same people who helped wreck our economy and the global economy will get them when we have fattened them up nicely again and reduced their tax liability.  This is shocking.  If it was the case that we would retain ownership in the long term and would derive some genuine benefit from putting them in a stronger position, I could understand the rationale.  However, the Minister has stated clearly that his intention is to re-privatise these banks at the first opportunity.  We have more or less done that with Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p>  The difference in attitude between AIB and Bank of Ireland when they have come in here to address issues of concern, such as how they deal with distressed mortgage holders, credit for the SME sector and all the other issues we try to put pressure on them to address, is very clear.  The more privatised the bank is, the more its representatives completely ignore and disregard the concerns of the very people who bailed them out.  AIB representatives are a little more polite in their demeanour because we have some influence over them.  However, ultimately AIB will go down the same road that Bank of Ireland has already started on.  We are just reducing their tax liability and leaving them, literally, laughing all the way to the bank when we have done all the hard work of bailing them out.  This measure is just more of that and is completely unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700015#O00700","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1385553000,"counter":823,"content":"<p>What I propose is that a restriction that applies uniquely to Bank of Ireland and AIB and to no other bank in the European Union will be removed, so that the Irish banks are not at a disadvantage.  If I recall correctly, when the NAMA legislation was initiated, there was no such provision in the text as published by the Minister.  However, in the course of the debate, the Minister accepted an amendment to impose this restriction.  That helped ease the passage of the legislation and was justified at the time because there was significant anger in regard to the banks.  Many of the arguments made now by Deputy Boyd Barrett were made at the time and there was good reason for imposing this restriction then.  However, circumstances have changed since.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Doherty's question, the capital adequacy rules changed after the restriction on losses was enacted and it is reasonable to take account of changed circumstances in making broad assessments of the merits of provisions such as this.  If we were to keep the restriction, the use of tax credits against historic losses for core tier one capital provisioning would be time-restricted.  In other words, the time for using them would run out and we would not have the full use of them.  The other big difference is that we effectively own AIB now - 99% of it - and we have 15% of Bank of Ireland.  Therefore, we have a vested interest in the profitability of the banks.  One of the best ways to recover our money is that if the banks become valuable, we can sell our shares in the banks and redeem or extract the money that was put in by taxpayers.<\/p> <p>For example, three quarters of the deferred tax assets we are talking about here, which is &euro;3.4 billion of the &euro;4.5 billion involved, are sitting in AIB.  There is a large offsetting valuation benefit due to the State's 99.8% equity stake in the institution.  While we could have one view as revenue collectors, if there is a more rapid write-off of losses against potential profit, then, as an investor, the State has a huge interest in increasing the value of the shares it owns in the banks.  There is a disproportionate amount in AIB.  Of the &euro;4.5 billion of tax credits for historic losses, &euro;3.4 billion are in AIB.  This provision will enhance the value of the State's shareholding in AIB.  We also have an equity stake worth &euro;1.2 billion in Bank of Ireland and preference shares of &euro;1.8 billion in value.  This will benefit in value from this change.<\/p><p> There is a very restricted market for AIB so I would not take much notice of share values attributed to that bank at the moment, but the quoted share values on the stock exchange for Bank of Ireland are genuine prices in an active market.  If we look at the share value and if we look at what we have extracted from Bank of Ireland already, more has come back to the taxpayer in value than was originally put in on behalf of the taxpayer.  If the value of the State's investment in AIB can be correspondingly enhanced as it trades towards profitability, and we remove restrictions such as this, there is a good chance that over the years, significant amounts of taxpayers' money will be recovered.  That is the overall plan.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund does the valuation of our investments in the banks, and it marked the investment in the Bank of Ireland and AIB up to &euro;11.5 billion at this stage.  It is easier to give a more precise value to our holdings in Bank of Ireland, because we know the preference shares at par are worth &euro;1.8 billion, and there is a coupon on them as well.  If the preference shares were being sold, we would expect to get a bit more than &euro;1.8 billion.  It is publicly quoted and the shares last week were around 28 cent.  There is quite an enhancement in value there.  AIB is different.  AIB's advance towards profitability and effectiveness is about a year behind Bank of Ireland, but it is getting there.  It is moving in the right direction.<\/p><p> It was never the intention of Brian Lenihan, when he published the Bill, to have this restriction.  The restriction was brought in during the course of the debate, and I can understand why it was brought in, but circumstances have changed since and we are shooting ourselves in the foot if we maintain the restriction.  There is no benefit to the taxpayer, to Ireland or to any of our citizens in maintaining this restriction.  By removing it, we enhance the value of the portion of the shares that we have in both banks, and so I advise committee members to accept this.  There is no hidden agenda.  This is purely a matter of pounds, shilling and pence, and when we look at the balance sheet, we find that it helps everyone in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700015#O00800","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385553600,"counter":825,"content":"<p>The original restriction was a 50% restriction, but this is a timing issue.

It was decided in the legislation that when the banks started to make huge profit again the losses incurred when the Irish people saved them could not be written off against the profit so that they just soak up the profits.  AIB is a unique case because we own almost 100% of it.  Bank of Ireland is a different case.  We own 15% of it, which may decrease as it issues new equity shares on the market in the coming days.  We do not get all the profit from this measure for the Bank of Ireland.  Its shares may increase from the 15% that we own but others such as Wilbur Ross will benefit significantly from this.  If we are doing this for the sake of the core tier 1 capital ratio, so be it.  I have no problem in treating AIB and Bank of Ireland in the same way if it is to help the definition of capital adequacy ratios since this measure was brought in.<\/p><p> I had tabled a later amendment that has been ruled out of order.  It proposed that the levy on any financial institution benefiting from section 33, AIB and Bank of Ireland, which allowed them to benefit from carrying 100% of their losses forward, should be adjusted in accordance with the estimated revenue lost to the State in each relevant year, resulting from lifting of the restrictions of the carry-forward.  That deals with their capital adequacy ratio because they can carry forward the 100% losses and write them off against their tax liability to the State.  We citizens are at a disadvantage when these institutions return to profitability in respect of the tax that they would pay to the State on their income.  Through the back door we have under this Finance Bill adjusted their levy to reflect how they had benefited from the 100% of the forward losses.<\/p><p> The Irish people demand no less than that Bank of Ireland, which is predominantly in the private sector, make a return to the Irish State above and beyond the capital that we injected.  This is not simply a question of arithmetic about how much we put in and how much we want back.  That is not acceptable.  The State paid &euro;4 billion to Bank of Ireland but ordinary citizens went through pain and suffering and hardship as a result.  This was not &euro;4 billion that was stuffed under the mattress or waiting for a rainy day.  It was &euro;4 billion taken off citizens in the ways we have discussed, through sons and daughters who have emigrated, people who have been unemployed for long periods of time, benefits cut and entitlements slashed.  The people therefore have a justifiable demand that banks will not be facilitated at a time of huge profitability by carrying forward the losses that they incurred in the past so that they write-down their income to the State.<\/p><p> The banks incurred the losses at an exceptional time.  We are not treating them as ordinary banks.  The Minister says that we should treat them as ordinary financial institutions like those in every other country in Europe.  They are not ordinary financial institutions like those in any country in Europe.  They are unique.  They were bust.  They were completely defunct.  They are being investigated.

If they bought their house for &euro;350,000 or &euro;400,000 and it is now worth &euro;100,000, can they get a write-off on their negative equity against tax liability for future years?  They cannot but a bank that helped to bankrupt the country and made astronomical losses, which those very mortgage holders and people on low incomes, all those who have been the victims, bailed out.  They provided the resources to give the banks that write-off on previous losses.  Ordinary people do not get a write-off against previous losses.

Is that what this is really about?  Is the Government worried, despite constant protestations that we have the best capitalised banks in Europe?  Is the rationale for this to use these tax assets to ensure core tier 1 capital ratios?  I thought we had fully capitalised banks so why precisely is that an imperative?  Let us not forget that the Minister also told us that we would get retrospective recapitalisation of our banks because that was agreed at the meeting in June of last year.  Why, if all that is true, we have fully capitalised banks we will get retrospective recapitalisation of them, is Joe soap yet again giving a handout to banks by way of their capacity to write off previous losses against future tax liability?  Fairly soon these banks will be sailing off into the sunset again after we have paid for their crisis and will be paying for decades to come.

We are down to two banks with leverage and clout, Bank of Ireland and AIB.  It is in everyone's interest that those banks are strong and do not operate under disadvantages that no other bank in Europe is asked to operate under.  I think we would have some level of agreement on that.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty tabled amendments which are quite helpful to the debate but unfortunately they were ruled out of order.  That is normal.  We do not know what will be ruled out of order and what will not.<\/p> <p>I will read the briefing note and reply to Deputy Pearse Doherty's proposed amendments.<\/p><p> I note that Deputy Doherty has proposed an amendment No. 104 to increase the amount of the bank levy payable by the banks that would benefit from lifting of lost restrictions under section 33.  This amendment was ruled out of order but I would be happy to address the substance of his proposal at this stage.  It is important to highlight that the financial institutions who stand to benefit from the removal of section 396C are AIB and Bank of Ireland only.  As the Deputy is aware, the State has substantial investments in both banks through its equity and debt holdings.  When section 396C was first introduced, the State involvement in the banking sector was far more limited and critically, equity stakes had not been acquired by the two banks.  The State now has substantial shareholding in both banks.  I am obliged now to review the decision that was made when the NAMA legislation was introduced with the interests of the taxpayers, as shareholders in both banks, in mind.  Each of the banks is carrying significant amounts of unused losses.  The future value of these losses to the banks is recognised on the banks' balance sheets as deferred tax assets.  Under the new capital rules known as CRD4, these deferred tax assets are gradually deducted from capital, over time.  Hence, the problem with the lost restriction contained in section 396C is that it has the effect of lengthening considerably the period of time over which the losses can be utilised and so the deferred tax asset stays on the balance sheet for longer.  Thus, it negatively impacts on the capital of these two banks and the value of the State's shareholding in the banks which is directly linked to the value of these deferred tax assets.  Lifting the restriction in section 396C will reduce the period of time over which the deferred tax assets are to be carried on the balance sheets.  I believe that the cash flow and tax receipts will be offset by the improvement in the valuation of the State's equity and debt investments in both banks.  That is the complete note in reply to Deputy Doherty.  <\/p><p> In reply to other questions, core tier 1 is the principal reason for removing an exceptional and unique restriction of normal loss relief which applies to AIB and Bank of Ireland but to no other company in the country.  Capital adequacy rules changed after the restriction was introduced, such as more tax from, for example, AIB, less value in State investments, impact on the capital adequacy of the banks.  The last factor has become more significant after the loss restriction was introduced.<\/p><p> I was asked what was the situation in other countries.  I have a note which I will read to the committee in reply.  On the question of deferred tax assets, DTAs, Italy and Spain have similar issues with large DTA balances and their impact on bank capital ratios under the new CRD4 rules.  Measures that have been introduced include converting certain components of DTA balances into tax credits which would be honoured by the State should a bank face liquidation.  The effect of this is to preserve the pre-CRD4 treatment, that is, no capital deduction for these components would be required.  These measures go a long way beyond what is being proposed in this Finance Bill with the repeal of section 393C which can be seen as a normalisation of the system.  The repeal serves only to remove a restriction placed on the utilisation of NAMA losses which does not apply to other trading losses in the tax code.  It is worth noting that the losses subject to these measures in other countries relate largely to deferred tax assets arising from timing differences and not those arising from trading losses.  In Spain we understand that up to 40% of DTA balances may fall into the timing difference category.  The position in Ireland is different but the vast majority of DTA balances at AIB and Bank of Ireland relate to trading losses.  That is the fullest information I have.  There is no hidden agenda.  This is a straightforward judgment about the value of the banks and how to restore our banks to full health in the interests of the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700017#Q00500","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385554800,"counter":853,"content":"<p>Even if the current restriction remained in place, all of the losses being carried by the banks would, over time, be offset against their profits, as Deputy O'Donnell pointed out.

The expenditure must be incurred on equipment listed under one of the ten energy-efficient categories covered by the scheme.  The category of electric and alternative fuel vehicles is being extended to include natural gas-powered vehicles and associated fuelling equipment and natural gas vehicle conversions.  I have been advised by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, that such vehicles meet the policy objectives for energy efficiency and that the use of such vehicles in Ireland should be promoted.  The section will come into operation on 1 January 2014.  As done previously for the existing categories, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, will make an order listing the products that will be eligible under the extended category.

In other words, these provisions already apply to new companies.  For existing companies, the effective date of implementation is 1 January 2015.  The reason for this is that, historically, any change to the corporation tax regime in this country has been introduced on a phased basis.  For example, there was a phasing-in period when the rate went from 10% to 12.5% and when the rules regarding export sales were changed.  The Deputies will know from their own contacts with those concerned that companies do not like surprises or sudden moves.  They need some time to plan.<\/p><p>  Second, there is no loss of taxes arising from this measure because the companies involved, the arrangements of which in this regard we are now eliminating, always paid tax on their earnings in Ireland.  The issue was that profits made elsewhere in the world were being channelled through these stateless companies which were incorporated in Ireland.  There was no advantage to the Irish Exchequer in this; the advantage was to the companies.  Moreover, there was no reason they could not have engaged in the same practice in other jurisdictions.  Ireland is not a tax haven, but there was a reputational advantage in having the arrangement in Ireland simply because we enjoyed a very good reputation in this area.<\/p><p>  Deputies have asked why we have chosen to move on this issue and not the wider one.  We have taken action in this matter because we can fix it in domestic legislation, whereas all of the other issues raised in the debate require international co-operation in order to address them.<\/p><p>  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett asked about the nature of the conversations my officials had had with representatives of the various companies.  It would not be fair to the businesses in question to go into who said what and when.  The summary of their position is set out in the tax strategy document that was published on budget day and which is the result of the consultation process.  It represents the distilled wisdom arising from the consultation and is in the public domain.<\/p><p>  What we are doing in this measure is very important for reputational reasons.  The debate continues, of course, and we are fully participating in the discussions on the base erosion and profit transfer issues at OECD level.  We hope these discussions will advance quickly.  It is our view that the international corporation tax regime is not sustainable, even in the short term.  Changes must take place and we are fully engaged in ensuring they do.  At the same time, however, attracting foreign direct investment to one's country is a very competitive activity and there are very aggressive tax planning arrangements available in other countries.  Our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, is becoming increasingly attractive as an investment destination precisely because of the aggression it is showing in this regard.  Its patent box initiative, for instance, is subject to scrutiny by the European Commission on state aid grounds.<\/p> <p>If it gets it, as designed, over the line, it will be offering a 10% corporation tax rate for companies which fit the requirements of the patent box.  A significant number of people in Ireland are working in foreign direct investment companies.  The future attractiveness of Ireland for new foreign direct investment companies or those already here that wish to expand is vital to our economic prosperity.  While we want to and are willing to change, we do not want to get too far ahead of international practice either.  That is because this is a very competitive area.<\/p><p> The OECD is moving rapidly.  Its tax director, whom I met on his visit to Dublin, has laid out a programme which would involve a blueprint for action being published by September next year and action being taken shortly thereafter.  He has the political support to take action now, particularly as the OECD has been mandated by the G20.  The leaders of the G20 across the board are on record as stating change is required.  The OECD has been vested with the responsibility of designing and implementing that change.  That is the current position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700019#S00700","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385556000,"counter":881,"content":"<p>We are required to break for lunch at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700020#T00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1385556000,"counter":882,"content":"<p>Can we have a few moments to conclude on this matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700020#T00300","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1385556000,"counter":883,"content":"<p>If the debate drags on, I will suspend proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700020#T00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1385556000,"counter":884,"content":"<p>I will not make a speech on the matter.

However, there were obstacles to us questioning them about the detail of what was involved.  The Minister has stated no additional tax will accrue to the State as a result of the adoption of this measure because the profits involved were not really generated here.  I would like to drill down into this.  One way to do so would be to talk to the companies in questions, but to date, we have not been allowed to do so.  Another way would be to quiz the Minister about it, but I do not know whether he fully understands what is involved.  My understanding was that the companies involved sold advertising from here all over the world and that they then paid for the use of software and patents to these shelf companies which were incorporated in this country but which were not liable for tax here.  The selling was being done from Ireland.  Is the distinction between profits generated in Ireland and those generated elsewhere but channelled through this country actually real?  A company operating in Ireland can sell goods or services all over the place, but that does not mean that the sales it makes from here should not be subject to tax.  Such a company might be selling goods or services to some other location, but there is not doubt that it is selling them from here.  Companies of this sort avoid their tax liabilities using the moneys generated to pay royalties for the use of patents.  There is a need to examine this matter in its entirety.  We should not allow the companies involved to find new ways to avoid paying the taxes they should be paying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700020#T01600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1385556000,"counter":896,"content":"<p>That is beyond the boundaries of what is contained in the Bill.  It is, however, an issue and forms part of what the OECD is reviewing.  That organisation has been charged with drilling down into this matter.  What I am about to say may be of assistance to the Deputy.<\/p><p>  In today's economy much of the value of products can be attributed to the intellectual property of the company producing the good or service.  Royalties are typically payments for the right to use intellectual property.  Services exports from Ireland, particularly those relating to IT, are royalty intensive.  Services exported have grown in recent years to over 50% of GDP.  While a high volume of such intellectual property-rich goods and services is sold from Ireland, the underlying intellectual property is not typically owned here.  Thus, the Irish sales company must pay royalties to the intellectual property holding company which is located abroad.  The intellectual property involved is not typically developed in Ireland, nor is it owned here.  Ireland, therefore, has no right to tax it.  The ability of companies to locate valuable intellectual property in low-tax jurisdictions where they may not have real substance or presence is the real problem.  This is what allows some multinational companies to achieve very low effective rates of tax.  The OECD is examining this issue, principally through a reconsideration of its transfer pricing guidelines which deal with profits from intangible property.<\/p><p>  We have stated all along that this is primarily an international issue.  It is overly simplistic and unrealistic to expect that the world's tax problems can be solved by changing Ireland's domestic law alone.<\/p> <p>The Irish tax code operates to ensure that profit generated in Ireland is taxed in Ireland.  If we consider corporate tax receipts as a percentage of total tax revenue, the ratio in Ireland of 2.4% in 2011 is close to the European Union average of 2.3%.  We are taxing profits that are generated in Ireland.  To put it very simply, if one has a company in Ireland and part of its cost base is paying for intellectual property which is located in a company incorporated elsewhere, then, as was the case in our previous discussion, the cost of the intellectual property imported into Ireland can be offset against the profits in Ireland.  It reduces the base on which we can apply the 12.5% tax rate.  To remediate that is not within our hands because, obviously, the write-down of inputs is a normal part of the international tax code, but it is something that needs to be remediated internationally and it is one of the key issues that the OECD is addressing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700020#T01700","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385556600,"counter":898,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1385556600,"counter":899,"content":"<p>I propose to suspend the sitting until 2.15 p.m.  We will resume with section 39, amendment No. 66 in the name of the Minister.

The rulings require that equality of treatment for corporation tax purposes be provided between domestically sourced dividends and dividends received from other EU member states.  The amendment inserts a new subparagraph into paragraph 9I of Schedule 24 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  That paragraph was enacted in Finance Act 2013 in response to a court ruling in the FII Group Litigation case, which required that the foreign nominal rate of tax be taken into account when calculating double tax relief for foreign tax paid on dividends from EU or EEA partner countries.<\/p> <p>This requirement was met by providing for an additional foreign tax credit to be allowed by reference to the foreign nominal rate of tax.<\/p><p> It has been determined, however, following recent representations from taxpayers, that the current legislation is not yet fully in compliance with the judgment.  It allows for the additional credit to be claimed where the dividend paid to the Irish company is paid directly out of the profits of the paying company that has suffered foreign tax.  It unintentionally denies the additional credit where the taxed profits are paid indirectly to the Irish company.  The proposed amendment addresses that.  It allows for the additional credit to be claimed where the dividend that is paid to the Irish company is attributed indirectly, through other dividend-paying companies, to profits that have suffered foreign tax.  That will ensure the paragraph operates as intended, and in line with the ruling of the court.  The amendment also makes two technical amendments to paragraph 9I of Schedule 24.  The amendment takes effect from the passing of the Act.  I commend the amendment to the committee.<\/p><p> The amendment was introduced in order that the treatment of the issue would be in line with the European court&rsquo;s judgment, which followed in the intervening period.  We are simply reflecting the judgment in the treatment of existing Irish tax law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700022#V00300","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385557200,"counter":909,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385557200,"counter":910,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 67 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1385557200,"counter":911,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 68:<blockquote><br \/>In page 60, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:<br \/><b>&ldquo;39. <\/b>The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the effective rate of tax charged to domestic businesses in this state and separately to multinational corporations, and analyse the impact of this Finance Act with regards to lowering the effective tax rate or increasing it.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>Amendment No. 68 calls for a report to be prepared and laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann within three months of the passage of the Bill on the effective rate of tax charged to domestic businesses in the State and, separately, to multinational corporations, including analysis of the impact of the Finance Act with regard to the lowering or increasing of the effective tax rate.  We had a discussion, which the Minister of State attended, about the Irish incorporated non-resident change to the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  It was a change I welcomed as I had articulated the argument on many occasions and produced legislation to give effect to it.  We must take further steps.  While I acknowledge completely that certain aspects of multinational corporation tax and the ability of such companies to write down their effective rate of tax by using either loopholes in tax codes in this country or in other jurisdictions or by means of shifting profits from this jurisdiction to other jurisdictions is outside of our hands to a certain degree, there are issues we can address in domestic law to deal with the matter.  One measure is the acceptance of the Irish incorporated non-resident tax and the closing of the loophole for businesses that are stateless.<\/p><p>  The next step we must take is to look at the effective rate of tax charged on domestic businesses and multinationals and the impact of the Bill on them.  We have had responses from the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and other Ministers that the effective tax rate is 11.9%.  I am sure he is aware, as I am, that the report that investigated the profits and concluded the rate was 11.9% looked at generic companies across the various jurisdictions.  It was a ceramic company that does not export.  I am sure there are many small and medium enterprises, especially non-international trading ones, that pay a lot more than 11.9%, but the reality is that for the companies we are talking about, they are not in the same category as the one investigated in the report that gave rise to there being an 11.9% tax rate.  I refer to major multinational corporations that have elaborate tax structures in this jurisdiction and elsewhere.  There should be nothing to fear in the provision of a report on the effective rate of tax charged on domestic businesses and the impact of the Finance (No. 2) Bill on them.

I have a long note but I will put it on the record because it is useful given the various views about effective tax rates based on the latest report to issue.<\/p><p>  The issue of effective tax rates has been the subject of a number of parliamentary questions and discussions at this committee over the past 12 months.  It is important to note that two separate issues are often confused in discussions on the effective rate of corporation tax.  The first issue is the global rate of tax which is paid by multinational companies.  This is a so-called blended rate and takes into account the amount of tax charged across all the countries a company trades in and not just Ireland.  The ability of some multinationals to lower their worldwide rate of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and all countries operate.  The best way to address this issue effectively is for countries to work together at international level, and the appropriate action is being considered in this regard by the OECD as part of its project on base erosion and profit shifting.  I know that is an issue the Minister, Deputy Noonan, raised before the break because I was watching proceedings on the monitor.  It was an issue on which I spoke to the committee following the most recent informal ECOFIN meeting in Lithuania when we got a very good presentation from the secretary general of the OECD concerning the gold standard it wants all countries to follow.  There has been a significant move within the European Union in the direction the OECD has been heralding for some time.  The issue the Minister raised before the break was the importance of countries moving at the same time and at the same pace.  I am aware there has been considerable discussion of the matter at the committee.<\/p><p>  The second issue, which is the subject of Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s proposed amendment, relates to the effective rate of tax paid by companies in Ireland once account is taken of certain tax reliefs.  Deputy Doherty has proposed that I prepare a report on the effective rate of tax charged to domestic businesses in this State and separately to multinational corporations, and to analyse the impact of the Finance (No. 2) Bill with regard to lowering or increasing the effective tax rate.  I wish to make it clear that all companies operating in Ireland &ndash; domestic businesses and multinationals - are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities here.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits, as well as certain petroleum, mining and land dealing activities, and chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.<\/p><p>  Some other countries may have a higher headline rate of corporation tax which is then supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs.  We are all aware of the extraordinary variety in some countries&rsquo; corporate tax rate as against their effective tax rate.  That is a predominant issue that arises constantly in the debate.  The approach in Ireland, however, is transparent.  We have a relatively low headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.  We have only a small number of corporate tax incentives in Ireland, such as the research and development tax credit and the three year start-up relief for small companies, and we ensure these are targeted at the creation of additional employment and at areas of innovation with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.  The Finance (No. 2) Bill contains only modest enhancements to corporate tax incentives, for example, the amendments to the research and development tax credit in section 21 have a cost of &euro;5 million per annum.<\/p><p>  Deputies are aware there are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax and there is no single internationally agreed comparative measure for that.  In the absence of an agreed methodology, it is inevitable that differences will exist in comparative studies on effective tax rates depending on how the rate is calculated and the assumptions used in the calculation.  That has been an issue that has been addressed by the committee in the past year.  It is probably more accurate to characterise the calculation of effective rates as an art rather than a science.<\/p> <p>There are a range of independent studies, however, that show the effective rate in Ireland is very close to the main headline rate of 12.5%.  For example, the European Commission's Taxation Trends in the European Union 2013 indicates an effective corporation tax rate for Ireland of 14.4%.  Another study carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Paying Taxes 2014<i>, <\/i>which was published just last week, shows an effective rate for Ireland of 12.3%.  I know some Deputies have challenged the validity of the assumptions used in previous versions of that latter study, and I am not claiming ownership of the figures, but they are examples of the way different methodologies can produce different results.<\/p><p> Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s request that I publish a report on effective rates, I would highlight to him that the Revenue Commissioners produce very detailed corporation tax distribution statistics each year.  In response to the growing interest in this subject, Revenue published an explanatory note earlier this year to accompany the 2011 statistical report which contains data from 2010.  These 2010 statistics indicate that aggregate net taxable profits, after taking account of various deductions, allowances, charges and reliefs, amounted to &euro;41.215 billion while the total amount of corporation tax payable on these profits was &euro;4.246 billion.  This means that total corporation tax payable as a percentage of taxable profits was approximately 10.3% for that year.  If we were to add all the corporation tax paid and divide that by the profits, that is the percentage at which we would arrive.  That is the 10.3% effective rate it has produced.  Revenue statistics for 2011, to be published shortly, show little change in the position, with a figure of 10.4% estimated for that year.  While this percentage is lower than the 12.5% tax rate, this can be attributed to the availability of certain reliefs such as double taxation relief and the research and development credit used by many substantial businesses here.  The 2010 statistics are available on Revenue&rsquo;s website, while statistics for 2011 will be published on the website shortly.<\/p><p> Given the detailed material produced by the Revenue Commissioners and the need to allocate scarce resources most effectively, I cannot accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700023#W00600","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385557800,"counter":914,"content":"<p>As the Minister is aware, I have challenged the Government consistently on this issue in the past year or two and the very least it could do is accede to a request to provide the analysis and assessment Deputy Doherty has suggested in order that we can have the hard evidence before us and the public.  That would allow them make their own judgments on this issue.<\/p><p>  There is considerable slippage in terms of the gross profits made by companies, the idea of taxable profits and the actual profit made.  I have not pulled this idea out of my head.  I am putting my assertions on this issue to the Minister of State and other Ministers on the basis of information I got from the Department of Finance's CTS table 1 or 2 and from looking at EUROSTAT figures on corporation taxes paid in the various economies across Europe.  It is clear that what is known in the EUROSTAT figures as the implicit rate, which is another term for effective rate, namely, the gross profits paid as against the actual amount of tax paid at the end, the latter as a percentage of the former, was 6.5%.  That is according to those tables produced by EUROSTAT.  The comparable figures for almost all other major European countries of implicit rates were much higher.  The only exception to that was the Netherlands, which had an implicit rate similar to ours.<\/p><p>  That assessment of implicit rates paid in Ireland in comparison with implicit rates paid elsewhere in Europe must be examined.  The Minister of State has said we apply normal accounting standards, that taxable profits and gross profits are different and that it is all above board, but what he fails to explain is the reason for the gap between the implicit rate in Ireland, according to EUROSTAT's figures, and the implicit rate in Britain, Germany, France, Sweden and so on.  With the one exception of the Netherlands, why is the gap so big?  I put it to the Minister that at the very least this must be investigated because, to put it mildly, it is suspicious.<\/p><p>  The CTS 1 and 2 tables on that the Minister provided me with show that the main beneficiaries of this enormous gap between gross profits and taxes paid are a few hundred companies at the highest end of the profit scale.  What is interesting is that in the table the Minister produced for me in response to a question in which I asked him for the breakdown in deciles of the gross profits and the taxes paid, he provided that information until he got to the most profitable companies, which I believe numbered a few hundred.  At that point he stopped giving me the information in deciles and stated that because there are so few companies involved at the top end, it would be breaching confidentiality to give me the information in deciles because I might be able to identify them.  I do not accept that but we all know the identity of those companies.  They are the big multinationals.  I am certain the small and middle companies further down the table are paying 12.5% but it is the big companies that account for the majority of gross profits declared in this country that somehow manage through various measures to reduce their tax liability between gross profits and what they actually end up paying.  That area must be seriously investigated because Ireland, along with the Dutch, the home of the Dutch sandwich and the double Irish, has this massive gap.  That suggests something amiss with our corporation tax regime which is allowing these hugely profitable corporations to dodge their tax liability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700024#X00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1385557800,"counter":915,"content":"<p>We have been back and forward on this issue for some time.  The Deputy is committed to his figures and we are committed to ours.  The fundamental difference is that he is not having regard to the various allowances, losses and royalties companies face in the transaction of their business.  I would question whether a separate independent investigation by our authorities, over and above what is happening internationally, would shed more light on the subject.  For instance, the OECD is very involved in this issue in regard to politically exposed persons, PEPs.  The Deputy is probably also aware from the replies he has received from the Department that the European Commission has examined this issue very closely and its view is that the effective tax rate in Ireland is 14.4%.  That has been its position for quite some time and it has stated it clearly.<\/p><p>  I have said to the Deputy in the past that we cannot tax something we do not own.  The reality for these large-scale multinational businesses is that their entire operation is separated into many different parts of the world.  As I have told him repeatedly, the IP of many of these devices and applications in the technology area is in one part of the world, manufacturing is in another, sales is in another and marketing is in another.<\/p> <p>The Government cannot tax something that is outside this country.  As the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has stated consistently, the Government's responsibility is to be responsible for taxing things that occur in this country.  This is the reason the effective rate is so close to the actual rate of 12.5%, unlike other countries, because, ultimately, the Government taxes what takes place within this country.<\/p><p> The Deputy has also heard the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and me state that a period of change is under way.  There is a significant European-wide initiative in this area, led by the bigger countries but which Ireland is supporting, to ensure there will be an advance in this area.  The work of the OECD in creating the international standard on this - in respect of both information and the application of a solution - ultimately will resolve this particular problem.  However, one can test the view stated by the Deputy.  He is firm in his view - while the Government is firm in its view - that the 6.5% rate or the 6.8% rate applies because the distinction is between total profits of companies as against total taxable profits.  That is the fundamental distinction the Government makes in asserting that Ireland's effective tax rate is quite close to the actual tax rate.  I read the recent PwC report that highlighted a huge disparity in other EU member states in respect of the effective tax rate by comparison with the actual tax rate.  I do not believe Ireland has anything to fear or anything about which to be concerned in the circumstance where there is such a small gap between the effective tax rate and the actual tax rate that exists here.<\/p><p> I will repeat what I told to the committee a while ago regarding the Revenue Commissioners' information on this, which has been published.  It is worth re-stating that the Revenue Commissioners have stated their information is that of the figure of &euro;41 billion, the total amount of corporation tax payable on these profits was &euro;4.2 billion.  This means that even on their figures, there is an effective tax rate of 10.3%, as opposed to the actual rate of 12.5%.  Consequently, while there is a necessity to analyse this issue further, that analysis is ongoing at international level.  It is feeding into the European-wide response to this issue and I do not discern any necessity for additional analysis on Ireland's part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700024#X00300","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385558400,"counter":917,"content":"<p>This debate will continue and I note there are differing views, even among the members of this small sub-committee on finance.  Each of the three members on this side has very different views on corporation tax.  I am not trying to raise or decrease the rate in this amendment.  As the Minister of State is aware, Sinn F&eacute;in's position is to maintain the rate of 12.5% and not to raise or decrease the effective rate of tax.  The purpose of this amendment is to seek information and one cannot have a discussion on tax policy without adequate information.  I understand the Minister of State's response to Deputy Boyd Barrett and agree one cannot tax income that is not taxable.  That is fair enough and I acknowledge the availability of tax credits, carry-forward losses and all those measures that are contained within the tax code.<\/p><p>  One could, however, do what is done in respect of income streams all the time, which is to demonstrate in a clear and transparent fashion the effective tax rate for the top 10% of taxpayers in the State.  This is known because such information can be acquired from the Government in a clear fashion.  Although the aforementioned top 10% of taxpayers can avail of multiple ways to reduce their tax liabilities through reliefs, investments and a range of activities, Revenue has the figures on their total income, the tax they paid and the effective rate of tax.  Some areas pertaining to corporate structures are completely different from personal income.  Doing this should be possible, however, and the Revenue Commissioners have information on the tax paid by companies, including the income, the taxable income, the taxable profits and so on, that should be capable of being presented to a finance committee or to Parliament in a way that does not interfere with the tax privacy of an individual or company.

This can be done for income tax and it has been beneficial because when members discuss income taxes, they should be discussing effective tax rates.  It does not really matter for many people whether their marginal rate is 52% if their effective rate is 30%, because that is what they care about.  It is a question of how much of one's money is going to the taxman or woman and that is also what companies consider, namely, the effective rate, not the headline rate.<\/p><p>  There is a way to do this and I have asked the Minister for information in this regard.

One should not be afraid of having an analysis in this regard because one could be 100% right or 100% wrong or perhaps the truth lies somewhere in the middle of all the arguments that have been made.

The Government has relied constantly on the ceramic pot manufacturer as the rationale for Ireland's 11.9% effective corporate tax rate but that has been exposed, as it simply does not make sense.  It is a start-up company, it is not exporting and cannot carry forward losses because it is only in its first year of operations.  It does not make any sense when compared with the companies with which members are discussing here, the top ten of which I understand pay 25% of all corporation tax raised in this State.<\/p><p>  This amendment is not about challenging that state of affairs and if it is happening internationally, so be it, but what is wrong with having this discussion here?  It is happening here in any event; it is just that it is not an informed discussion.  It is a nonsense discussion because for the past year, members have been throwing arguments, accusations and all the rest backwards and forwards but they do not have the data.  Consequently, a way should be found to provide those data that does not skew or benefit the Minister of State's argument, my argument, that of Deputy Boyd Barrett or of any other Deputy.  Instead, the raw data should be provided in a way that can be presented to facilitate such a discussion.  I believe the best way in which to do this is for the Government itself to commission such a report.  If the Minister of State holds strongly that the effective tax rate in the State is 11.9% - I understand PwC issued a statement in the past two days stating it is 12.3% or thereabouts - and if he is convinced in that regard, were I in his position, I would be telephoning the printers and telling my officials to get that report completed to knock this myth on the head because the tax structure of the State is under attack.  If this is the case, let us unveil and unmask the truths and lay them bare for all to see.  Thereafter, were the European Commission to ask questions about Ireland's corporate tax structures, we would have nothing to hide.  However, if it is not even possible to satisfy Deputies in respect of such information, how will it be possible to satisfy opponents who may wish to have a go at us because they wish to attract the type of investment the State has enjoyed heretofore?  It is in the Minister's interest to do this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700025#Y00900","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1385559000,"counter":925,"content":"<p>The way in which we have been approaching this subject - we have had regard to comments that have been made by colleagues at the committee throughout the year and during the annual Finance Bill process - is to look at an assessment, subhead by subhead, of the effectiveness of tax.  When the Minister produced his statement this year, a number of reports were issued that day on the effectiveness of tax schemes that we have introduced.  We have done that on the basis of proposals that have been made.  That is a fair way of doing it.<\/p><p>  The problem is that companies are not tax individuals.  Tax individuals, in the majority of cases, exist in one country.  Multinational businesses exist in multiple countries and, as I stated in my opening statement, essentially a blended rate applies.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty's amendment, in the context of multinational companies, states the Minister shall \"analyse the impact of this Finance Act\".  In any given year, a corporation's ability to pay tax is not based only on the Finance Bill.  A multiplicity of issues, not only one Finance Bill, affect a corporation's rate of tax.  That must be borne in mind.<\/p><p>  The difficulty of producing a model for a company is, of course, the same difficulty that applies to all of the reports published to date by the OECD, the European Commission, PwC, this committee and others - it is based on the assumptions one makes.  The assumptions one makes differ, case by case, based on how much is forgone through research and development, capital allowances, etc.  That is the difficulty that arises in this regard.<\/p><p>  The question I would pose to Deputy Pearse Doherty is with what bit of the data in this area that Revenue has produced on an annual basis is there a difficulty.  Without being specific to companies, groups of companies or a model company, it gives the raw data across the tax head, which, incidentally, we all want to see go up.  It is in the country's interest that we get more on the corporate tax side after the collapse that occurred in 2007-08.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700026#Z00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1385559000,"counter":926,"content":"<p>May I answer the Minister of State's question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700026#Z00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1385559000,"counter":927,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputy Boyd Barrett and then bring in Deputy Pearse Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700026#Z00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1385559000,"counter":928,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that we are having this discussion.

There were much higher implicit rates and that is what I want a proper explanation for.  That is not an explanation the Minister of State can give here but it is something, along with all those headings through which the companies write down their tax liabilities, that needs to be analysed.  That is the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700026#Z01300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1385559000,"counter":937,"content":"<p>The question can be answered.  If the Minister was willing to do this, we can get our heads together and look at how we can present the data in a way that does not reveal the personal taxation issues of any company.<\/p><p>  Going back to my quote about statistics, one can dig deep into them.  Recently <i>The Irish Times<\/i> carried a report which stated, in terms of the top 1,000 companies in the State that account for 50% of the corporation tax payable, the average effective tax rate was 15.5%.  Obviously, there are reasons for that.  There are two rates of tax.  The Minister of State identified the 12.5% rate and then there is also the investment corporate tax which is the higher rate of 25%.  Where is the rate for a company?  Each individual company, as one went through it, had a different rate.  Some paid no tax because they were carrying losses forward.  Some paid a low rate of tax.  Others have disputed those figures and torn them apart, and have gone into the details of individual companies.  This is the problem with the debate.<\/p><p>  I have my own views, and my party makes no bones about it.  We want to ensure that we get the maximum effective tax rate possible from multinational companies but we have not said what that should be because we do not have a clue what it is at present.  Earlier, we discussed income tax.  While one cannot look at personal taxation and company taxation, in the past high earners were able to use all the different parts of the tax code to write down their tax liabilities and we brought in a minimum effective tax rate or a high-earner's restriction in the personal tax code.  We do not have such a provision in taxation for companies.  It is not as simple for companies.  If one were not allowing companies to carry losses forward and if they had to pay a minimum effective tax rate, it could be most disadvantageous to a company.  We need to look at it through careful lenses.  However, we need the information to have that discussion.<\/p><p>  There will be issues within the Finance Bill that will impact on this measure but, to tell the truth, I would not have got this through without the reference.  A number of my amendments have been ruled out of order because they are declaratory.<\/p> <p>One must tie an amendment in with the Finance Bill if tabling it.  I will not labour this point because we have discussed it enough.  When I was arguing about the section of the legislation that needed change, and which is changed as a result of this Bill, I argued with officials and the Minister that we needed to close down the loophole.  Counter-arguments were made to the effect that we must all jump together and so on.  What we do not want is a model company based on rates for a fictional ceramic company, as instanced, but the actual data for real companies. The Minister of State outlined the difficulty of having a model company. Deputy McGrath spoke to the Minister yesterday about the good analysis at the end of the budget book.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700026#Z01400","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385559600,"counter":939,"content":"<p>John and Mary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700027#AA00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1385559600,"counter":940,"content":"<p>Only one couple out of seven, namely John and Mary, were affected by the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700027#AA00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1385559600,"counter":941,"content":"<p>There is no change in the tax rates and bands.

The issues are exactly the same.  We had a very useful discussion in Lithuania on the basis of the OECD report and on how we move from the current double taxation agreements to the automatic-exchange-of-information agreements, which was discussed before this committee in the past.  Countries raised at the meeting the view that if our revenue system gives information on individuals and companies automatically to the US IRS, for instance, can we be certain that the IRS, which operates in a federal system, has the same breadth and capability as our system?  Can one compare the IRS to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, for instance?  It is a genuine practical issue.  If one is giving information and expecting information in return, one must ask whether both systems have the same reach.  These are very complicated issues by virtue of the fact that we not only have different rates across the board, but also different systems and applications of those systems.<\/p><p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s ambition is the same as that of the Government, namely, to ensure the effective tax rate is as close as possible to the actual tax rate.  We share that ambition entirely because it is to ensure the total amount in tax taken on the corporate side increases as there are increases in economic activity.  I am not sure whether I gave the relevant statistics to the committee earlier.  We were taking &euro;6.4 billion in 2007.  Last year, 2012, it was down to &euro;4.2 billion, and this year it will be &euro;4.3 billion.  We anticipate it will be &euro;4.38 at the end of 2014.  The ambition of us all is to get more under this particular subhead.<\/p><p>  The question of higher-income earners, as raised by Deputy Doherty, constitutes the very point of difference.  We know who the higher-income earners domiciled in this country are and, by and large, we know their income.  We know, broadly speaking, what they pay in tax given our effective tax rates.  However, can one say this genuinely about large-scale multinationals that operate across multiple countries and tax regimes?  The most recent information from the Revenue Commissioners, as I understand it, is that 95% of the top 100 companies in this country are multinationals.  They pay &euro;2.8 billion.  Effectively, 68% of the total in corporation tax is paid by the top 100 companies, as one would expect.  I would not like members to leave this meeting in the belief that the companies are in some way not paying a contribution to the Irish Exchequer under the existing tax code because they are.  This is evidenced in the Revenue data.<\/p><p>  I repeat my question to my colleagues opposite: what parts of the Revenue information published annually do they have a difficulty with?  Perhaps this is related to the point Deputy Boyd Barrett was raising when he asked how we go from &euro;70 billion down to &euro;41 billion and then produce the effective rate of 10.3% based on the amount of tax on profits paid.  There are three subheads that result in the reduction.  Capital allowances account for &euro;12 billion approximately.  Loss relief accounts for approximately &euro;6.5 billion, and approximately &euro;11.5 billion is related to trade charges or royalties.  Earlier, I referred to the IP issue.  These are all reductions on the total tax bill because they are reckonable expenses, similar to those that any other business would have.  If the Deputy requires further information from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, perhaps he needs to get it from it.<\/p><p>  I appreciate Deputy Doherty's amendment because it allows us to debate this issue, which we would not otherwise have had an opportunity to debate.  I fully understand why he tabled it.  On the Deputy's comments on having another form of statistics, there is no agreement in this area, and that is why the OECD model and a movement in that direction involving Ireland playing its role with other states in the European Union comprise the only way through in arriving at some appreciable outcome.  We have absolutely nothing to hide here.  We have a very clean and clear corporate tax rate of 12.5%.  Irrespective of the effective tax rates mentioned in the various reports that are issued, ours is a hell of a lot closer to that which other countries are charging in terms of all the discounts, provincial or otherwise, that they can factor into their tax systems.  If we need more information on this, it will be provided.  The OECD is the way to go because it provides the gold standard in terms of tax information exchange, as I have said this committee on numerous occasions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700027#AA00600","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1385559600,"counter":944,"content":"<p>I have a suggestion separate from that in the amendment.

The amendment in section 40 is designed to ensure only the real economic capital cost of the asset to its owner is allowed as a deduction in the computation of a chargeable gain or allowable loss on a subsequent disposal, where the cost of an asset has been financed with borrowed money that is not repaid to the lender and is ultimately written off.<\/p><p>  This amended section contains several refinements to ensure the section works as intended.  These include ensuring a loan released before the disposal of an asset will be subject to the restriction.  This amendment is necessary as it appears some arrangements for the release of debts may provide that a debt is released before an asset is actually disposed of.  It will also ensure any restriction or deemed chargeable gain does not exceed the lesser of the amount of the loss nominally made or the amount of the debt released. It will ensure a deemed chargeable gain cannot arise in respect of an asset that is exempt or fully relieved from capital gains tax while the release in a group of companies of an inter-company loan funded from within the group is not subject to the restriction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700028#BB01100","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1385560200,"counter":964,"content":"<p>This is a substantive amendment, replacing section 40.

That section amends section 598 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which grants relief in respect of a disposal of business or agricultural assets which have been owned and used by the individual disposing of those assets for at least ten years prior to the disposal.<\/p><p>  The relief also applies, subject to certain conditions, to land which has been farmed for the required minimum ten-year period and is then let.  Section 41 extends the relief to a disposal of farm land which has been farmed for the required minimum ten-year period, is let for a period or periods of up to 15 years, with each letting being for a minimum period of five consecutive years, and is then disposed of to a person other than a child of the person disposing of the land.  The purpose of the extension is to encourage older farmers who have no children to lease their farms on a long-term basis.<\/p><p>  Section 41 properly confirmed the application of the lower limits of the relief to the consideration received on such disposals when made outside the family. In this connection, a limit of &euro;750,000 applies where such disposals are made when the disponer is aged between 55 and 66, while a limit of &euro;500,000 applies from 1 January 2014 where the disponer is aged 66 or over.  In doing so, however, the wording of the amendment also imposed the same lower limits on the current relief for disposals of land which is let and subsequently disposed of to a child.  This relief has been in place since 2007.  It has been suggested the more generous levels of relief which apply to disposals to a child within the meaning of section 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, and which, up to now, have applied to such disposals of land which has been let, should not be restricted.  This would have the effect of reducing the attractiveness of long-term letting in such situations.  Currently, there is no upper limit on the relief available where the farmer aged between 55 and 66 disposes of qualifying land to a child within the meaning of section 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Where the farmer is aged 66 or over, a limit of &euro;3 million will apply to such disposals on or after 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>  This amendment ensures where land which has been farmed is let and subsequently disposed of to a child, the higher levels of relief available under section 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 will apply, thus restoring the position that has applied since 2007.<\/p><p>  I recommend the amendment to the select sub-committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700028#BB01800","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1385560200,"counter":971,"content":"<p>Does this amendment allow a farmer to dispose of land to persons outside of his or her family and still claim the relief?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700028#BB01900","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1385560200,"counter":972,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700028#BB02000","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1385560200,"counter":973,"content":"<p>The section was always confined to a child of a farmer.

The relief only applies in circumstances where the investor holds on to the property for a period of seven years.  The big collapse in tax revenues was focused on stamp duty.  The 2008 figures show that, from a position where we took in approximately &euro;50 billion in tax on an annualised basis, we dropped by &euro;14 billion in one year.  Much of the collapse is attributable to the property market.  Nobody is going back to the over-hyped market to which Deputy Pearse Doherty referred, but in a context where the number of transactions is low, everything should be considered to encourage the continued emergence of the positive signs we have seen in the property market.  The extension of the scheme for another year is simply aimed at encouraging people to take up these opportunities over a seven year period.  I do not think it will over-hype something already in place.  We do not have one property market; we have multiple markets, as the Deputy will be aware from his constituency.  It is not dissimilar to what is happening in the United Kingdom, where the London property market is very different from what is happening north of a line between Manchester and Birmingham.  We have to be conscious of this, but many of the developments of the future will be related to where we locate development, as opposed to the taxation system.  Is it good to try to achieve more of a yield in an area which has experienced a cataclysmic reduction in taxes?  Yes, it is.  Will it help stability?  I very much hope it will.

The view on the street is that we have reached the bottom and are starting to see prices rising once again.  That is why people are jumping at the same time.  Investors prefer to wait until a market hits the bottom in order to maximise profits.  We do not need to give them additional incentives.  I strongly suggest we do not continue the scheme this year.

He said we make &quot;no distinction between the risky, hard-won, job-creating gains of entrepreneurial activity and gains from non-productive speculation on land&quot;.  He critiques what is being proposed on capital gains tax, CGT, entrepreneurial relief.  It is welcome and is a step in the right direction but he points out that to benefit, one must first make a capital gain, not before 2010, pay the CGT in full and reinvest the proceeds in another venture which may be risky.  If one is lucky and that venture gets to a successful exit, the best-case scenario is that one's overall effective CGT rate across the two investments drops to 22%.  Meanwhile somebody who buys property and holds on to it for seven years pays no CGT.  That is a valid point which is wroth debating.  Since 2008, the UK offers a 10% CGT rate on gains from entrepreneurial activity.

The taxation of remote betting operators is designed to level the playing field with traditional bookmakers and the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013, published in July, provides the regulatory framework for this.  The Bill was subject to a three-month standstill period under the EU technical standards directive.  This commenced in July and a number of communications seeking clarification around aspects of the Bill have been received from the Commission and responded to by the Department in that time.

This was also proposed as part of Sinn F&eacute;in's pre-budget submission.  However, the Government's preferred approach has been to extend the base on which the 1% rate applies, ensuring that the tax is applied fairly widely on a level playing field for all.  When we can be sure that we have in place a framework that captures all betting, the prospect of a rate rise can be explored.  All taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis by officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners and this one will be no different.  However, the priority is to extend the tax to the remote sector.<\/p><p>  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, if one applies a tax in one area of gambling but not remote betting, people will move into the latter.  My understanding of the Minister's objective is that, by applying the 1% rate across the board, we can consider extending it at some future point.  A level playing field is necessary.  Gambling has witnessed much change in recent years, for example, online, on course and off course.  We must reflect these changes in how we capture betting.  The Minister's current priority is to establish a level playing field for everyone.

The Betting (Amendment) Bill was published in July.  This has been signalled.  The 2% increase was included in the Finance Act 2010, but a decision was then taken not to proceed with it.  The Minister of State is 100% right, in that online exchanges should have been subject to this excise tax.  Additional questions arise.  I have met some of the exchanges.  They have provided a service but are exempt from VAT.  They have had it very sweet for a long time.  Thankfully, they will enter the tax net after this Bill passes through the Houses.<\/p><p>  However, a level playing field is not the issue.  We must increase tax revenue.  While I welcome the Minister of State's comments on achieving a level playing field and then considering increasing the rate, my amendment would only require that a report on the options be made.  It is not simply a case of increasing the rate to 2% in respect of bookies and wondering what to do with the exchanges.  Currently, the rate is 15% compared with 1%.  What would be the effect of a 2% increase?  What would be the impact in terms of jobs, etc?  We must tease out all of these factors.  The Government may provide figures to this committee next year and there may be an increase, but we should flag it now.  The industry has not been taxed appropriately when taxes on nearly all other sectors have increased.  If one gambles, a 2% or 3% tax on the bet is not onerous.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State and I are in the same area.

It deprives the Exchequer of much-needed revenues and poses a significant threat to legitimate business.  For these reasons, tackling the problem is treated as a priority for this Government and by its agencies, in particular the Revenue Commissioners.  With regard to the Deputy's proposal that all invoices issued for farming contracting services carry a VAT or PPS number, I am aware of this proposal as it was discussed in the D&aacute;il in the context of the Committee stage debate in a previous Finance Bill.<\/p><p>  Farmers are not obliged to register for VAT in relation to supplies of agricultural produce.  A farmer who is not registered is known as a flat-rate farmer and will not have a VAT number.  Under VAT legislation, the invoice or settlement voucher issued in relation to a supply of agricultural produce or services is required to include the full name and address of the flat-rate farmer who supplied the goods or services.  There is no requirement under VAT legislation to include a PPS number on any invoice or similar document issued to a customer.  However, the recipient of the goods or services must have a valid invoice or settlement voucher that sets out the name and address of the supplier, the details of the supply, the amount charged, etc.  This document must be retained for a period of six years by the person who is claiming a deduction from income tax in respect of the expenditure.  This ensures that a satisfactory audit trail exists between both parties.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that the need to tackle the black economy must be balanced against imposing onerous additional administrative burdens and costs on business.  New measures to improve compliance are always being considered and it is important that those measures are proportionate.  My officials have discussed this issue with the Revenue Commissioners and it has advised that regular reviews and compliance operations in this sector are carried out.  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners have received general complaints about tax evasion in the industry in the past from farming representative bodies but, when requested, no specific details of non-compliance or tax evasion have been submitted.  If information of this nature is presented, it will be treated with total confidentiality and it will be fully investigated.<\/p><p>  As stated during the discussion on this issue last year, if contractors would like to make information available to us on a totally confidential basis, we will follow up on it.  We do not believe the problem as identified by the Deputy is widespread, although I do not think that is what he is suggesting.  This is the reason we have not received any specific complaints from contractors of this particular problem.<\/p> <p>It will clearly be kept under review.

I can be persistent.  I am making the same points I made last year.  The process would not be overly burdensome.  I would be the last to apply additional layers of bureaucracy as we should shed bureaucracy from the agricultural community, with efficient regulations to replace the overly burdensome red tape that we have.  There is the issue of asking any contractor getting payment for a service to put a PPS number on an invoice and many people know these numbers by heart.  It is not a major burden to ask these people to do this.  It is normal practice.  I used to work in a project in the community sector and I spoke to somebody recently involved in the sector but outside of that project.  As the work is State and EU-funded, if there is an event involving the Minister performing an official opening, there may be problems even supplying tea or bread for sandwiches.  If the supplies from the shop were not tendered to three different parties or have a tax reference number or address, they are ineligible for consideration.  Nevertheless, it seems the Revenue Commissioners believes a PPS number should not be put on what is an invoice.<\/p><p>  We can correspond that with previous sections of the Finance Bill.  The home improvement scheme is very good and we can see the rigorous checks and balances used in that respect.  The contractor must go to the Revenue Commissioners and be approved, and there should be details of the work and estimated value.  There must be a timeframe and they will be given a unique identification number that must be submitted to the individual paying for the work within ten days of getting paid.  The contractor and claimant must provide all these details, including the property reference number for the property tax.

(1) The Revenue Commissioners may, for the purposes of the prevention and detection of tax evasion, serve a notice in writing on an accountable person whom the Commissioners have reasonable grounds for believing is likely to have further information, explanations or particulars in respect of any books, records (within the meaning of section 108), accounts or other documents relating to his or her supplies of goods made to his or her customers which may assist in identifying taxable supplies in respect of which tax chargeable will not be, or is not likely to be, paid requiring the accountable person to furnish to the Commissioners any such information, explanations or particulars as they may reasonably require and which they consider may so assist.<br \/>(2) A notice served under subsection (1) shall&mdash;<blockquote>(a) specify&mdash;<blockquote>(i) the date from which the notice shall have effect, being a date not earlier than 7 days from the date of service of the notice,<br \/>(ii) the information, explanations or particulars, referred to in subsection (1), required to be furnished to the Revenue Commissioners,<br \/>(iii) the period for which the notice shall have effect, being a period not more than 2 months from the date specified under subparagraph (i),<br \/>(iv) the period within which the accountable person shall furnish the specified information, explanations or particulars to the Commissioners, being a period not less than 14 days from the end of the period specified under subparagraph (iii), and<br \/>(v) the form in which the specified information, explanations or particulars shall be furnished to the Commissioners, and<\/blockquote>(b) inform the accountable person of the consequences under section 115(8A) of failing to comply with the notice.&rdquo;,<\/blockquote>and<\/blockquote>(b) in Chapter 3, by inserting the following subsection after subsection (8) of section 115&mdash;<blockquote>&ldquo;(8A) A person who fails to furnish to the Revenue Commissioners the information, explanations or particulars specified in a notice served on the person under subsection (1) of section 108A within the period specified in the notice shall be liable to a penalty of &euro;4,000.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>This amendment inserts a new section 108A into Part 13 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  It also amends section 115 to provide for a related penalty.  The amendment will assist in identifying tax evasion.  The new section provides for the service of a notice by the Revenue Commissioners on an accountable person, requiring him or her to provide additional information or explanations in respect of his or her taxable supplies during a specified period.  The notice will specify the type of information required and the format in which it should be provided.  The measure will be used to address tax evasion by identifying shadow economy activity such as unregistered traders and suppressed sales by VAT-registered businesses.<\/p><p>  For example, where the Revenue Commissioners have identified an unusually high level of cash sales in a business which mainly supplies to trade customers, there would be an indication that goods may be used in the shadow economy activity.  The supplier may or may not be aware that he or she is facilitating shadow economy activity if the customer does not require a VAT invoice to be issued.  Using the new power, the Revenue Commissioners may require a supplier to provide additional information such as, for example, relating to cash supplies for specified goods in excess of a specified value.  That would assist compliance programmes in certain trade sectors.<\/p><p>  The amendment to section 115 provides for a penalty where an accountable person to whom a notice is served fails to comply with that notice.  This is being asked of us by the Revenue Commissioners, although it may be a contradiction of the previous discussion I had with Deputy Doherty, who wanted us to put PPS numbers on invoices.  This is a genuine issue that has been highlighted to us by the Revenue Commissioners concerning cash businesses, where it is recognised there are substantial cash payments in a business to trade suppliers.  We have been asked to seek the approval of the House in doing this in order to remove this form of tax evasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700036#LL00900","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385564400,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.\r\nSECTION 63<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1385564400,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 86 is an alternative to amendment No. 85 and the amendments will be discussed together.

The exemption for the transfer of shares in ESM listed companies is provided for in subsection (1) of the replacement section.  A minor technical change is being made to original version of section 86A in the Bill as initiated by removing the words &quot;for trading on&quot; as these words are superfluous.  The exemption will apply on the basis that the shares are &quot;admitted&quot; to the ESM.<\/p><p>  A new subsection has been inserted into section 86A to ensure the exemption will cease to apply where the admission of the shares for the ESM has been cancelled by the Irish Stock Exchange.

The section provides for an exemption from the 1% duty for transfers of shares in companies listed on the ESM of the Irish Stock Exchange.  The exemption, which the Minister announced in his budget speech, is one of the measures he has introduced to support entrepreneurs to create new businesses and additional jobs.

It has been specifically designed to meet the funding needs of companies at the early stages of their development.  The ESM rules provide for a low cost streamlined admission process and facilitate dual listing in similar markets in other jurisdictions such as the alternative investment market of the London Stock Exchange.  The Irish Stock Exchange is also in a position to offer a similar dual ESM-US listing that will give Irish growth companies access to US dollar pools of capital, as well as European pools of capital.

The total amount of stamp duty on overall share transactions is &euro;170 million so the amount of &euro;4.5 million or &euro;5 million out of &euro;170 million is quite small.  An American investor made the point to me that 60% of the new jobs created in the US economy, particularly in manufacturing, were in companies that had not been established at the start of the crisis.  Start-ups and ensuring small businesses can ramp up quickly to become large businesses are the key features of what the US economy has become.  Some 60% of all jobs created are coming from those new businesses.  It is important we have the same entrepreneurial speed in ensuring small companies can become big quickly.<\/p><p>  My good friend, Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, raised the matter of the financial transaction tax.  It is one element of the historic progress made during the Irish Presidency and came to pass while the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was chair of the ECOFIN discussions.  Commissioner Semeta, whose proposal it was to advance the financial transaction tax, has come to some difficulty with the ruling of the court in respect of the applicability of the financial transaction tax.  It remains the case that we have a tax on share transactions.  This applies not only to the profits to be made but also to the transaction in the first place.  The amendment and the proposal should not be presented as a major derogation when it only applies to a tiny percentage of the &euro;170 million, and is in contrast to the point made by Deputy Michael McGrath in respect of sums that yielded in excess of &euro;600 million in 2007 and 2008.  This is a means of encouraging investment in small and developing businesses that want to be listed on the fledgling stock market.  The evidence from the US is that this is the kind of activity we must encourage.  Many of the new businesses creating those jobs come and go quickly.  It is a question of how nimbly one can get investment on the international money markets.

The purpose of section 126AA is to provide for the stamp duty levy on certain financial institutions which was announced in the budget.<\/p><p>  These amendments are being made in order to ensure that the levy is payable by financial institutions which were liable to pay DIRT in 2011 and are trading in the State at the due date for payment of the levy, that is, 20 October in each of the years 2014, 2015 and 2016.  A financial institution, which has ceased to carry on a business of taking and holding deposits at the due date for payment of the levy, will be liable to pay the levy where the financial institution is carrying on a trade or business in the State at the payment date.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 95 is the main amendment which substitutes a new definition for &quot;relevant person&quot; in subsection (1) of section 126AA.

No money has been paid out to anybody under the redress scheme at this point in time.  There is an  onus on all of us to move this on as quickly as possible.  That being said, I welcome the amendment.<\/p><p>  The original section of the Bill dealt with the \"relevant individual\" but with this amendment, reference is made to the \"relevant payment\".  What was the logic behind this change?  A \"relevant individual\" was clearly somebody who worked without pay in the laundry or institution, whereas the \"relevant payment\" refers to those who have been awarded under the redress scheme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700040#PP03500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1385566800,"counter":1262,"content":"<p>The reason we are bringing forward the amendment on the definition side is that originally everyone was put on an even basis.

The Minister of State should not be outdone by the Minister; he could grab the headlines by accepting the amendment.<\/p><p>  The amendment would require the Minister to prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on options available for the abolition of the local property tax.  As the Minister of State will gather from the wording, the amendment provides me with an opportunity to raise the issue of the unfairness of the property tax and the manner in which it is being imposed.  It also draws attention to the fact that the rushed legislation on the local property tax created a significant imposition on individuals and sowed great confusion.  I refer to the manner in which the Government handled the legislation and shut down debate on it on Committee Stage.  Its flawed approach comes with a &euro;3 million price tag. <\/p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to repealing the local property tax and has published legislation to that end.  People are justifiably angered by this tax.  While it does not feature in this Bill because it was introduced last year, it has been imposed in part this year and the full amount will be recouped in 2014.<\/p> <p>People are very mindful, given the date that is in it and the deadlines for making their returns.  There have been number of fiascos in the property tax.  I come from a Gaeltacht community.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance yesterday.<\/p><p> It is very clear that the Revenue is requesting certain property-holders who live in the Gaeltacht or who have part of their addresses in Irish are appearing in duplicate form on the register and, therefore, are being asked to pay twice the amount of property tax.   However, the computer system shows that the house is not being rated at a higher level of tax but that in the view of the Revenue, that person owns two houses because one of the names is in Irish which was sourced from a utility company and the other one is in English which it may have sourced from the electoral register or from the local authority.  This is a significant issue.  <\/p><p> I accept that human errors will occur and that the register is large.  However, data software is available to deal with such work but either the Department or the Revenue has decided not to use it.  This is surprising, given that this tax brings in &euro;500 million.  It seems the view is that it does not matter if we stick those in the Gaeltacht for another property that they do not have - they will sort it out themselves and tell the Revenue and everything will be grand at the end of the day.<\/p><p> This is an unfair imposition on individuals.  I do not exaggerate the point.  Many people in Irish society can well afford to pay this tax.  I will raise the issue again and next year I will bring forward an amendment.  I do not know the Minister of State's personal circumstances and I do not wish to delve into them.  However, in the tax code, Ministers of State, senior Ministers, office-holders in this House, can have tax written off if they have a second property.  There is a reason for that - it is called the dual abode allowance-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700041#QQ02900","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385568000,"counter":1294,"content":"<p>It does not apply in my case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700042#RR00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1385568000,"counter":1295,"content":"<p>As I said, I am not interested in any individual's personal circumstances.

If a Minister, a Minister of State or an office-holder wants to buy a house in Dublin, they are permitted to write off the interest on the dual abode allowance, auctioneer fees - as far as I know - the maintenance costs and electricity and gas.  If they rent accommodation they are permitted to claim for the full rent.  It is not acceptable, in my view, that this is available to Ministers, office-holders and Ministers of State, while at the same time, ordinary people the length and breadth of the country who have only one house, who may be clinging for dear life in an effort to hold on to that house, are being subjected by the same Ministers who are able to avail of a unique section in the tax code which allows them to have their tax reduced because of the dual abode allowance.

Why is it that Ministers who have houses can get an unvouched allowance of &euro;6,500 from the Revenue?  It is unbelievable.<\/p><p>  This issue is a hobby-horse of mine.  Getting rid of the dual abode allowance will not save a significant amount because there remains the issue of Ministers and Ministers of State and office-holders who need to reside in Dublin to carry out their duties.  I make the comparison of that situation with the situation of people who have little or no disposable income.  Four weeks away from Christmas those people are considering how to provide for their children and loved ones and more and more people are going to moneylenders, legal and illegal, and are tapping the credit union and the banks to try to get the loans they need to get them over Christmas.  They are thankful the weather is not bad because they would not be able to afford the heating bills of previous years, yet the Government has decided to increase their property tax liability by ensuring that the full year's effect takes place in 2014.  A large number of these individuals, even though the property is in place for only six months, have already paid 18 months' liability.  It is beyond belief that this is what is happening. There are numerous examples of this.  I have only focused on Ministers but there are better examples of how sections of society have not carried their fair share, how people have been treated in the Finance Bill.  I have had amendments ruled out of order by SARP.  These are very special people from outside our jurisdiction who come into companies and for whom we can write down their tax liabilities by massive amounts.  We give then tax deductions of tens of thousands of euro.  We allow them &euro;5,000 to send their children to private schools yet at the same the ordinary Joe soap in Ireland who tries to fight his way through the recession in the hope of some light at the end of the tunnel is hit once again.<\/p><p>  The property tax is only item but it is a big ticket item for them.  There are many other provisions in the budget that we have discussed in the past two days and in the Social Welfare Bill and the health Bills all of which impact in the same way.  Some will get on okay while others are drowning.  They are trying to keep their head above water and this imposition is one step too far. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700042#RR00700","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1385568000,"counter":1300,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty has made many of my points.  Apart from the suffering and hardship the property tax will impose on people, particularly in its second year because the full amount will be payable, it will hit people very hard on top of the accumulation of all the austerity measures, income cuts and levies that have been imposed in recent years.  Many people will be seriously affected.  It is clear from my clinic every week that a huge and diverse swathe of ordinary citizens are experiencing a level of hardship and financial difficulty almost to breaking point.  Life is getting rough for many people.  This year there will be even greater levels of hardship.  Apart from all that has been well argued and will become evident next year, two of the central arguments the Minister put forward to justify the property tax have been revealed as completely bogus.  That is why I commend Deputy Doherty's imagination for managing to get this issue into the committee discussions.<\/p><p>  In terms of options for alternatives, two of the central arguments we heard at the time the issue was being debated, have been shown to be utter nonsense.  One was that the money derived from the property tax would go into the provision of local services.  People should pay it, it was a great idea and it would finance local services.<\/p> <p>However, we have discovered that is not true.  The first year's take from the property tax went directly towards paying off the debt that was not ours and we have now discovered the second year's tax will go into the setting up of Irish Water, which will facilitate the charging of people for water.<\/p><p> The other argument used at the time was that if only we had had a property tax, we would not have had the property bubble, would not have had all the speculation in property, and the excesses that led up to the crash would not have occurred.  Now we are seeing a bubble beginning to develop again in property.  Therefore, having property taxes has not stopped the beginning of a development of another bubble.  Rents are beginning to rise and prices are rising in certain areas and it seems possible the whole merry-go-round of property speculation will start again.  The property tax is not proving something that will stop that.  I do not believe it will, because that was not the reason for it in the first place.  The presence or absence of a property tax did not explain in any way the reason we had a bubble at all or why we had speculation in housing.  That was to do with the marketing of housing and the greed of developers and bankers.<\/p><p> The amendment is well put.  I do not believe the Minister of State will respond positively to it, but this year we will see increasing evidence that the property tax is wrong at any time.  Alternatives to it should be sought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700042#RR00800","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385568600,"counter":1302,"content":"<p>I am more than happy to respond on this because the Deputy's comments need a response.  One of the worst decisions taken in our country over the past 50 years was the decision taken in the 1970s to buy an election by abolishing domestic rates.  We need to have a broadly based taxation system and to move away from a reliance on a narrow focus on taxes as a means of collecting taxes.<\/p><p>  I predict that despite all of the speechifying and the promises that will be made between now and 2016, the property tax will remain after 2016.  It will remain because having gone through the crash and the hardship of the past five or six years, the public in its maturity will see through those parties that now propose its abolition.  It is entirely right and proper that we tax wealth.  One of the principal forms of wealth is the asset in which they live.  Notwithstanding that and the difficulties people face, I believe this property tax, in terms of its application and the tax itself, is fair and proportionate.  If people are in very difficult circumstances, they do not have to pay immediately.  The payment is deferred.  Next year, approximately &euro;550 million will be raised via this tax.  Does anyone seriously suggest that in the future this tax should be laid aside or ignored?  The circumstances are that we must broaden the tax base.  This is one of the most jobs friendly taxes in that it does not propose an additional tax on work.<\/p><p>  When we have a grown-up mature debate on this, people will see through the arguments being made by the parties opposite.  People will realise that, as is case in jurisdictions not a million miles from here, a property based tax will remain and that it is important to have that tax as part of a broadening of the tax base.  Despite all the shouting, roaring and screaming about this, the fact its application has been so broad and the compliance rate so high despite the difficulties that have emerged from time to time, demonstrates the recognition by people that we had to take this route.  In circumstances where so many people are unemployed, we do not want to tax work further.  We want to ensure incentives are built into the economy for people to take up work.  Despite all the politicking on this, the property tax is here to stay.  I suspect that it will remain after the next election.  In regard to the dual abode allowance, I understand that people with two properties pay property tax on both, or if they have three properties, they pay tax on the three, irrespective of the allowance.  This tax is not part of the Bill to which Deputy Doherty referred.<\/p><p>  I would argue strongly that the decisions taken by the Government, in terms of further reductions in pay, a reduction of 50% in the cost of ministerial transport, the abolition of termination payments affecting every Minister, demonstrate the intent of the Government in terms of having a fair adjustment.  Four years ago, the Taoiseach's pay could have been &euro;310,000 but now it is down to approximately &euro;165,000.  I have no difficulty with showing my payslip to Deputy Doherty after this meeting so he can see the \"enormous\" sums of money I manage to draw down as a Minister of State.  It is breathtaking, to say the least.  To pretend to people that those at the top have not seen a great adjustment in terms of a reduction in net income is a lie, and everyone knows that.  This argument is further extenuated by the European authorities in their assessment.  <\/p><p>  We know, from all of the assessments done by the European Commission and the OECD that the way the adjustment has been done has been most progressive, in that those who have more pay more.  We also know, by way of the 39 countries tested under the OECD, that we have the third most progressive tax regime.  The evidence is there from international bodies who have no axe to grind in this regard.  They have made it clear that our adjustments have been fair, proportionate and progressive, in terms of those who have most having to pay most, as it should be.  To suggest that the terms and conditions of those in ministerial office have not changed dramatically and that changes have not been borne by them is not true.  People know that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700043#SS00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1385568600,"counter":1303,"content":"<p>This debate has been well rehearsed, and the Minister of State will get the last word, in any event.  We will leave here disagreeing.  However, I think it is indicative of the way the Minister of State approaches this that he said people live in assets.  The point is they do not live in an asset.  Most people do not live in an asset.  They live in a home, in a house.  They purchased it as a home and do not perceive it as an asset in that sense.  Putting a roof over their heads is a prerequisite for civilised and dignified existence and for enabling them to function in society.  That is the reason people go to great lengths and struggle and pay for their whole lives to put a roof over their heads.<\/p><p>  People are bitter and angry that after doing all that, they are now asked to pay again.  The Minister of State has said that people realise the property tax is the best route to take, but I do not think that has happened nor that he believes that.  People felt ambushed by the fact the collection of the tax was handed over to the Revenue and thought there was no way to continue a boycott.  There had been a substantial boycott, particularly in the first year when there was an overwhelming boycott.

A commitment was made to people at the time that they would not be asked to pay again.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State did not respond to my point.  He and all of his spokespeople said that we should pay this charge, even if we do not like it, because we need to fund local services.  The fact is that the Government has not increased the funding for local services, but has cut it.  For many of the services that we used to get from paying taxes, we now have to pay charges anyway.  There are charges for parking, for going into hospitals, increased rates, future charges for water and so on.

However, there has been an unfair impetus put on the Irish people at the lower level.  The Minister of State refers to reports from independent studies and so on, but he fails to mention the names of the studies.  For example, the ESRI is one such study.  The Minister of State should talk about the ESRI study and not rely on what happened before he came to office.  The ESRI's study on the 2012 budget showed clearly that it was regressive, \"with reductions of about 2% to 2.5% for those with the lowest incomes, as against losses of about 0.75% for those on the highest incomes\".  The ESRI is independent.  It carried out an analysis of the budget.  The Minister told us that the ESRI does not take full account of all the measures and so on, but that is a study.  I do not need a study to tell me where the impact has fallen.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State can argue and talk about gross figures, and I will go back to the Mark Twain quote about lies, damned lies and statistics.  It is not about who take the gross amount and whether the current Taoiseach took a pay reduction.  Of course he took a reduction, and he have should have done so, because the last Taoiseach was overpaid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700044#TT01000","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1385569200,"counter":1316,"content":"<p>----- of &euro;100,000.

People at the higher levels of income may have taken reductions in gross pay, or reductions in net income as a result of higher taxes and so on, but the point is that they have a larger disposable income and many of these measures, such as the local property tax, eats in harshly to disposable income.  For people on the minimum wage or the average industrial wage, there is a good chance that the property tax that they pay will not be a million miles away from the property tax that others pay, because the values of houses are not astronomically different across the State.  There are variations, but there are not massive differences.  However, the problem is with the disposable income of different individuals.<\/p><p>  These increases, such as the increase in VAT to 23%, the rise in carbon tax and the tax on fuel, small tax increases on cigarettes and wine and the price of a pint, the local property tax, prescription charges, accident and emergency charge increases, all dig into people's disposable incomes.  The Minister of State can stand on his soap box for long as he wants and claim that the Government has not touched bands, rates or credits, but that has fallen on deaf ears to many people who have seen the real impact of the budget.  The local property tax is one of those big-ticket items for them, and it should be abolished.<\/p><p>  Ideologically, the Minister of State is opposed to that view.  There are members in his party who were not opposed and who did not share his opinion on the abolition of the 1977 tax.  He makes a valid point that the property tax might have been abolished to buy an election.  Perhaps it was abolished for that reason, perhaps it was not.  Was the Taoiseach's statement at the time about the vampire tax his attempt to buy the election?  Are we going to claim that every single person who makes a proposal like this is taking an ideological view on this?  It is a property tax and not a wealth tax.  It is not an asset.  The Minister of State should talk to the 118,000 people who cannot pay their mortgages and tell them that this is their wealth.  For many people, it is a noose around their neck.  If they could walk away, hand back their keys and say \"Goodbye\" to the debt, they would be happy to do so.  This State is taxing debt to a large degree.  Some people are in equity and there is an asset involved.   There is value in the roof that is over their head.  However, for many people it is just debt.  This is an indiscriminate form of tax and it does not provide for services that it was supposed to provide.<\/p><p>  There are property taxes right across Europe and each one has a different role, structure and so on.  The same is true for wealth taxes, income tax and so on.  There is no property tax in the North, but there is a rating system in place where people pay tax for their property but they get services provided as a result.  We can argue whether that is right or wrong, but I would be willing to have a debate with the Minister of State on a type of system like that where there are no water charges, bin charges or book costs for going to school, and where people have their septic tanks emptied for free once a year, they get free dental care and health care.  Let us have that debate and I will be the first person to discuss some type of system to pay for it, and to make sure that exemptions are built in regarding income and debt and whether the property really is an asset or not.  However, that is not what we are at here.  This is just a money grab.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett has said, this is not going into local services.  The local authority budgets are being cut and we are now told that the 80% of property taxes supposed to be retained in local areas will not now happen because Irish Water will make a financial imposition on local authorities.   Local authority members are still waiting for their allocations to be announced as they try to prepare their budget.<\/p><p>  I have made my point and I will continue to make it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013112700044#TT01200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385569200,"counter":1318,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1385569800,"counter":1319,"content":"<p>We will take that vote at the end of this cycle.

I understand the committee already has a copy of the draft agenda.  The Lithuanian Presidency will provide the Council with progress reports on two dossiers, first, the proposed network and information security directive and, second, the proposed regulation on broadband cost reduction.  Both these files are an important part of the EU's digital agenda.<\/p><p>  There will also be an orientation debate on the recent Commission proposals on the single telecoms market, also known as the connected continent initiative.  The primary purpose of this debate is to provide some guidance and direction to the incoming Greek Presidency in terms of how best to manage this important and detailed file when it assumes the Council chair in January next.<\/p><p>  Under the any other business part of the agenda, the Presidency will provide the Council with information on the files relating to trans-European telecommunications networks, and electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions.  It is not anticipated that there will be any discussion on either of those two issues.<\/p><p>  The forthcoming Council should be viewed in the context of the recent European Council, which had a specific digital theme.  The conclusions of that Council meeting stated,<i> inter alia<\/i>, that the Heads of State wanted to see the completion of the digital single market by 2015.  The European Council welcomed the presentation of the Commission's connected continent package and encouraged the legislature to carry out an intensive examination with a view to its timely adoption.<\/p><p>  The draft network and information security directive relates to cyber security and proposes that member states be required to adopt national network information security strategies, designate national competent authorities and establish computer emergency response teams.  It sets out standardised procedures for dealing with the increasingly sensitive area of cyber security and proposes an enabling power for the Commission to specify mandatory reporting obligations in regard to security breaches on public administrations and on critical infrastructure operators.<\/p> <p>In general terms, Ireland welcomes the proposal although it is seeking clarifications on the precise scope of the directive.  A number of member states are of the opinion that the proposed obligations on market operators and public administrations to assess and report risks posed to their information systems, as well as taking the necessary steps to deal with such risks, are too onerous.  Striking the balance between commercial sensitivity and mitigating risks through information sharing will be an important feature of the final text on this directive.  I expect discussions on the detail of this file to continue through next year's Greek and Italian Presidencies.  I am conscious that the joint committee has expressed a wish to hold a meeting with my officials on this particular proposal and I have asked my colleagues to contact the joint committee with a view to arranging such a briefing as early as possible.<\/p><p> In respect of the progress report on the broadband cost reduction proposals, I understand the committee has already had an opportunity to discuss the detail of this file with my officials a couple of months ago.  In common with most other member states, Ireland's primary concern in this regard is with the proposed legal instrument.  While the Commission is proposing a regulation, the majority of member states would favour the greater flexibility a directive gives when taking into account existing national mechanisms for dealing with the issues and aims of the proposal.  Subsequent to last year's publication of both the next generation broadband task force report and the national broadband plan itself, my officials have been working with fellow Departments and local authorities and agencies with a view to streamlining and introducing greater consistencies into the consent and planning processes around the installation of telecommunications and broadband infrastructure.  I am very conscious of the extent to which civil engineering contributes to the costs of these investments and I hope that our initiatives in this area can have a positive impact on reducing overall capital investment requirements for telecommunications operators.  My Department is also continuing to work to ensure that it leverages, as much as possible, the existing State-owned infrastructure, again with a view to reducing the overall investment burden.<\/p><p> Much of this territory is covered in the Commission's draft regulation and the Government's aim is to ensure the measures being proposed are as effective as can be and as has been achieved to date in Ireland and do not cause additional complexity.  In the Government's view, a directive would be a preferable legal instrument that would allow member states such as Ireland to adapt legal principles to suit local circumstances.  A number of member states have expressed concerns about the impact of the proposed regulation on property rights, a concern which Ireland shares.  It will be important to resolve these issues as this proposal moves forward to ensure the proposals are effective and workable.  Much scrutiny work remains to be done on this proposal at working group level and I therefore expect no discussion or debate on the subject at Council next week.<\/p><p> The final substantive item on the Council agenda is the proposal on the single telecommunications market.  I understand the joint committee recently engaged with my officials on this matter and has issued a considered opinion on the subsidiarity aspects of the Commission's proposals.  The concerns raised by my officials during their appearance before this joint committee a few weeks ago have been echoed by a number of member states at recent meetings in Brussels.  The European Council, in its October conclusions, noted the need for intensive scrutiny of the proposal, which will assist in ensuring proportionate and effective outcomes from this measure.  The Lithuanian Presidency will chair an orientation debate on this issue at next week's Council.  This proposal is relatively new, having only been published in September.  I expect that member states will reiterate their support for a digital single market during the debate but will also signal the need for time to consider this new proposal in detail.  It is worth reminding members that during the previous Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council on telecommunications held in June last, which I chaired in Luxembourg, Ireland facilitated a policy debate on the concept of a single telecommunications market.  Although this debate was prompted before the Commission had published its proposals, it provided an opportunity for member states to signal any issues that were likely to be of concern.<\/p><p> Two key perspectives on policy emerged from that ministerial discussion, the first being that market consolidation across Europe may not be in the long-term interests of competition or consumers and the second being that spectrum is a national strategic asset and must be safeguarded for economic and other reasons.  I believe Ministers are very likely to hear a repeat of these key messages when they gather in Brussels again next week.  I am glad that the Lithuanian Presidency has devoted much of the agenda to a debate on this topic, as the Government has consistently underlined the need for in-depth and intense debate on it.  The Commission always has been proactive in promoting a seamless digital single market and this initiative seeks to accelerate progress towards this end.  Additional consumer protections, the elimination of roaming and other regulatory measures are all welcome ambitions and the Commission has a strong track record of delivery in these areas.  It is important, however, to have a measured and considered debate on this proposal to ensure the goal of a single European digital market is achieved as effectively as possible and to continue to support vital investments in telecommunications infrastructure and services. <\/p><p> At the Council next week, Ireland will highlight the continued need for the Union to maintain a stable and pro-investment regulatory framework, while continuing to progress the various elements of the digital agenda targets.  I am pleased to note that files which were prioritised during the Irish Presidency have been progressed by the Lithuanians, in particular the file on electronic identification, which will be the subject of a report under any other business.  Clearly, it is in the interest of Ireland and Europe to have a fully functioning, seamless digital market across Europe.  All of these measures contribute to that goal, which aims to increase Europe&rsquo;s competitiveness and ensure an more inclusive society for all of its citizens.<\/p><p> In respect of energy matters, the Council will deal with one legislative file, which is the draft directive on indirect land use change and Ministers are expected to adopt a common Council position on this file.  As for non-legislative activities, the Council will consider two reports, one on the internal energy market and the other on external energy relations.  These reports are being presented by way of follow-up to the European Council of 22 May 2013.<\/p><p> With regard to the fuel mix in the transport sector, the 2009 renewable energy directive set a target of 10% of transport fuels from renewable sources by 2020.  This target is binding on all member states.  The directive also requires that all biofuels used to meet the 10% target must comply with certain sustainability criteria, that is, they must not be made from feedstocks sourced from certain categories of land and must achieve certain greenhouse gas emissions reductions.  In October 2012, the Commission proposed a set of amendments to this directive and to the fuel quality directive to mitigate the potential effects of indirect land use change, ILUC, occurring as a result of the use of certain biofuels, sending a clear message to the market that second generation biofuels were preferable to biofuels made from food crops.  One amendment proposed was to limit the contribution that certain crop-based biofuels can make towards renewable energy targets for transport in European Union member states.  I share the concerns that biofuel production and its use, unless properly regulated, could have a negative impact on food production and on food prices.  Moreover, first generation biofuels also could lead to increases in greenhouse gas emissions, which would be contrary to the objectives of the renewable energy directive.  In this regard, Ireland has argued for a restriction on first generation biofuels and for incentives to encourage the development of advanced biofuels that do not affect food production.  Ireland&rsquo;s preference is to see as low a cap as realistically achievable to mitigate the potential conflict between biofuel use in the EU and land use in the developing world, and the potential for higher greenhouse gas emissions from certain categories of biofuels.<\/p> <p> This has been a complex file with views expressed across a broad spectrum, from arguments that it does not adequately address the risk of ILUC emissions to concerns about its impact on investment and jobs.  However, I understand that the Lithuanian Presidency is confident of securing a qualified majority at Council with respect to its text, which includes a cap of 7% on biofuels from food crops and the requirement that member states report to the Commission on the feed stocks used in making biofuels.  Ireland has supported the Lithuanian Presidency's efforts to reach agreement on this proposal and although, regrettably, a lower target is proposed, Ireland can agree to the overall text as a package in the context of a negotiation with the Parliament in 2014, and we will indicate that next week.<\/p><p> The Presidency will present a report on completion of the EU internal energy market by 2014, as a follow-up to the 2013 European Council's conclusions on energy.  The report is to be adopted at the Energy Council on 12 December and submitted to the European Council in March 2014.<\/p><p> The Presidency's report covers a range of issues concerning the completion of the internal energy market, IEM, including demand side issues; further empowerment of the energy consumer and protection of vulnerable consumers; the need for further discussion on generation adequacy and capacity mechanisms; and the importance of joint solutions to problems and of information exchange between member states, particularly on matters with potential implications for other member state.  In addition, the five energy policy priorities identified by the European Council, namely, the single energy market, investments, diversification of energy sources, energy efficiency and competitiveness, are also addressed in the Presidency's report.<\/p><p> The report highlights the importance of the TEN-E Regulation 347\/2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure adopted in April to end energy isolation, and states that the first list of projects of common interest, covering 248 projects spread over 12 priority corridors and areas, marks an important milestone for the implementation of a fully interconnected trans-European energy network.<\/p><p> With regard to investor certainty, the report states that a clear framework for climate and energy policies for 2030 is required.  In March 2014, the European Council will discuss policy options for the 2030 framework, having regard to the Commission's 2013 Green Paper, A 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy Policies.<\/p><p> The Presidency's report also notes the ongoing discussions on the Commission's proposed directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure; the Commission's plans to adopt guidelines on state aid for energy and environmental protection in 2014 so as to ensure that subsidies do not unduly distort the internal energy market; the updates on a number of programmes which will fund energy related measures; and the development by member states and the Commission of an action plan to implement the integrated roadmap which will prioritise the development of innovative solutions for the European energy systems in the future by mid-2014.<\/p><p> With regard to diversification, energy efficiency and pricing, the Presidency's report refers to the work being done by the Commission on an environment, climate and energy assessment framework to enable safe and secure unconventional hydrocarbon extraction, which is expected to be published before the end of this year.<\/p><p> The draft report contains updates about progress made by member states on the implementation of the energy efficiency directive and on the rate of transposition of the 2010 directive on the energy performance of buildings.  It urges member states to define and clarify the relevant regulatory and policy framework for nearly-zero energy buildings.<\/p><p> The report also lists the actions being taken to address the impact of high energy prices and costs, in the context of the EU competitiveness, including reviewing whether a new approach is needed on long-term contracts in the EU wholesale gas market.  In addition, the report looks forward to the presentation by the Commission of its analysis of the composition and drivers of energy prices and costs, as requested by the European Council.  That analysis will form the basis of further discussion on the factors underlying increasing energy prices and costs.<\/p><p> The report concludes by stating that sustained efforts are needed to achieve the 2014 goal set for completion of the internal energy market.  It identifies three priorities for attention: harmonisation through implementation of the third energy package; development of energy infrastructure without delay; and effective application and enforcement of EU rules on market integration and energy efficiency for a level playing field for companies operating in the EU.<\/p><p> In May 2013, the European Council called on energy ministers to follow up on their 2011 conclusions on the Commission's 2011 communication on security of energy supply and international co-operation, entitled The EU Energy Policy: Engaging with Partners Beyond our Borders.  Following the Commission's review in September 2013, and discussions with member states, the Lithuanian Presidency prepared a draft report dealing with the main elements in the global energy landscape since 2011.<\/p><p> The report identifies the most significant issues since the adoption of the conclusions in November 2011 as the continued growth of unconventional oil and gas production in the US, increased exports of US coal to the European Union leading to increased use of coal in electricity generation and reduced use of gas-fired plants in the EU - the competitiveness of European energy intensive industries has been affected; the potential for shale gas exploitation in the EU has become a significant issue in terms of security of supply and competitiveness; and new sources of fossil fuels are emerging, most significantly in the eastern Mediterranean.<\/p><p> Competitiveness continues to be a significant issue in Europe and energy prices are a major contributor to the debates.  The Commission is working on an analysis of the composition of energy prices and costs and will present this in January 2014 as part of the climate and energy 2030 framework package.  The topic for discussion at February European Council is competitiveness.<\/p><p> During the discussion at the September 2013 ministerial meeting in Vilnius, Ministers noted the significant progress on the energy community treaty, which will be the model framework for developing energy relationships with other countries and regions.  For example, there is a possibility that a similar energy community will develop from the Union for the Mediterranean.<\/p><p> Work on modernising the energy charter continues and membership has increased.  Russia has still not ratified the treaty.  However, it has paid its outstanding dues up to 2009 and continues to engage with the charter.  The aim of the ministerial session on 5 December is to assess the last 15 years of practice and theory in energy investment promotion and protection under the treaty.  The Lithuanian Presidency's text on the energy charter will be approved at COREPER on 29 November and presented to the Energy Ministers' December Council for endorsement.<\/p><p> Under any other business, there will be a presentation on the work programme of the incoming Greek Presidency and an update on recent development in the nuclear energy field.<\/p><p> It is expected that the Greek Presidency will deal with only one legislative measure, namely the ILUC file, which will inevitably be affected by the European Parliament elections.  The priority issue for the Greek Presidency is likely to be progress on the climate and energy 2030 framework.  The European Councils in February and March will discuss competitiveness and the 2030 framework, respectively.  The Greek Presidency will have input into both European Councils.  The March Energy Council is also likely to discuss the 2030 framework.  The other priority issue for the Greek Presidency will be the protection of vulnerable energy consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700003#B00800","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385545800,"counter":1360,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to discuss what will be a busy meeting for him.  I appreciate that he mentioned earlier that a number of items will not be debated and discussed, but in the context of the pursuing of a goal of a single European digital market, one question that would arise is whether the successful achievement of this will result in lower prices for the Irish consumer.<\/p> <p>What is the current state of biofuel production in Ireland in terms of secondary resources, as outlined, rather than those associated with the food area?  I understood that what little biofuel production occurs in Ireland is related to the food area.<\/p><p> Is it the concept of developing energy infrastructure without delay, as outlined in the report's conclusions on the completion of the internal energy market, that is forcing EirGrid to pursue its current policies on accelerating infrastructural development in Ireland?  Does the Minister have any comment to make on the ongoing debate on infrastructure?  A number of groups have appeared before the committee in recent weeks that are united in their view that there should be undergrounding of cabling in Leinster and the north midlands.  I would be grateful if the Minister, who has made a number of public statements in this regard, took the opportunity of clarifying the exact position.<\/p><p> With regard to the report on progress on external energy relations, reference is made to the continual growth of unconventional oil and gas production in the United States and increased exports of US coal to the European Union, leading to the increased use of coal in electricity generation and a reduction in the use of gas-fired plants in the European Union.  This is a very serious development, coming about primarily because of the literal collapse in the cost of shale gas in the United States.  A number of companies are able to sell their coal cheaper than gas, which represents a complete turnaround from the position a year or two ago.  It is stated that a particular type of coal, Illinois coal, does not seem to pose as much danger to the environment in terms of climate change, but I am not so sure because a leading expert in the coal area said recently that three quarters of the remaining coal deposits should remain in the ground.  Does this relate to Ireland in any way in the context of the increased exports of US coal to the European Union?  Does it affect climate change and our obligations in terms of trying to reduce carbon emissions?<\/p><p> Can the Minister give us an update on the position of Ireland on fracking?  A media report last week indicated that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, will produce its impact report in January or February of next year.  Can the Minister say when he expects to get that report?  What does he expect to do with it?<\/p><p> Does Ireland participate in nuclear energy discussions at Council meetings when they arise?  For example, under the heading of any other business, there will be a presentation on the work programme of the incoming Greek Presidency and an update on recent developments in the nuclear energy field.  I am curious about this because Ireland has a particular anti-nuclear position.  Do we actually participate in nuclear energy discussions or do we absent ourselves?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700005#D00200","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385546400,"counter":1362,"content":"<p>There are a number of important questions.  The primary motivation behind the digital single market across Europe is not so much focused on the impact on domestic consumers; rather, it is about facilitating continued economic growth within the European Union and removing obstacles to stimulating investment and growth within Europe.  It is a matter of enabling Europe to compete with Asia and the United States.  It is designed to encourage innovation and enterprise within the Union and to allow greater access to these markets for Irish businesses.  However, it is fair to say that a single digital market could only have a positive impact on prices.  It is certainly very difficult to understand why it should have a negative impact on prices.  A great deal of work has yet to be done.  Different member states have different traditions and histories in this regard.  The members will know from recent engagement with my officials that there is a great deal of work to be done.<\/p><p>  Senator Mooney is correct that what has happened in the United States has had a profound impact on the global energy market.  It was not foreseen as recently as five or six years ago.  The scale of discovery of shale gas and shale oil has had a considerable impact on gas prices in the United States.  The result is that the United States is now engaged in the export of coal to Europe.  I will not say it is cheap coal, but it is certainly cheaper, and that is beginning to change the geopolitical map in energy terms.  The United States is heading fast towards self-sufficiency in energy production, which would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked about the impact of US developments on Ireland.  They have little enough impact but they have major implications for Europe at Commission level in the sense that serious issues of competitiveness arise owing to the fact that the cheaper energy stock is available in the United States.<\/p><p>  The Commission is due to publish a paper on hydraulic fracturing by the end of this year.  Many member states will be interested in it.  Some member states are far more positive about the new technology than others.  Poland, for example, is very anxious to proceed with it.  Its rationale is that fracking makes a contribution to lowering carbon emissions because shale gas would be a better prospect considering its reliance on coal at present.  The British Government recently made taxation changes to encourage hydraulic fracturing in Britain.  Countries such as France have a temporary moratorium while they examine the issue.<\/p><p>  The moneys have been assembled and the basic groundwork has been done for the major study by the EPA.  Given the length of time it took the United States Environmental Protection Agency to produce its report, I do not believe we will have ours in 2014.  I believe it will be 2015.  As the Senator knows, there will be no hydraulic fracturing taking place in Ireland in the interim.  It is important that we carry out a proper, thorough and professional assessment of the technology and that we can ultimately rely on the science.  In political terms that is a long way down the road, but Europe cannot turn a blind eye to the competitiveness implications of what is happening elsewhere in the world.  We will have to engage in the debate, but I would like to see us engage in it when we have proper scientific analysis that will allow us to engage on the basis of fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700006#E00200","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1385546400,"counter":1363,"content":"<p>Does the Minister anticipate that there will be a move towards a comprehensive shale gas protection policy within the European Union following next week's meeting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700006#E00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1385547000,"counter":1364,"content":"<p>No.  The report was only seriously engaged in during the summer and will not be published until the end of this year.  There will not be any push in the interim until we get that report and member states have had an opportunity to examine it.<\/p><p>  No primary biofuels are being processed in Ireland and all secondary biofuels are from used cooking oil and tallow.  The biggest and most significant plant is in Wexford, which I visited recently.  It is increasing employment, has almost 50% of the market in Ireland and proposes to grow further.  <\/p><p>  The dispute in Europe is that there is something of a rethink about the correctness of using primary biofuels and a realisation that the emphasis should move towards secondary biofuels.  There is a bigger concern in the developing world.  The committee may have been subject to representations from NGOs that know what is happening in some African countries, where huge tracts of land are being cleared.  Big transnational corporations from Europe have bought up land for the production of primary biofuels.  It is land that could otherwise be used for food production, so there quite a lot of concern about that.  The Lithuanian proposal is probably the best that can be achieved in the current circumstances because opinion is divided.  During the Irish EU Presidency, when I chaired such Council meetings, I strongly supported the NGOs' arguments.  In this particular regard, the NGOs know what they are talking about and state that it is having a negative effect on food production in certain African countries.<\/p><p>  On the other hand, some member states have put huge investment into this area in the expectation that they would have certainty for some years ahead.  As a result, the 7% figure in the Lithuanian proposal will not meet the target of the NGOs, which have set their cap at 5%.  We will support the Lithuanian proposal, however, which is likely to be as good as we will get at this time.<\/p><p>  We do participate in the nuclear debate and express the Irish position.  The debate is topical for a number for reasons.  Post-Fukushima, the decisions that have been made in Europe are highly significant.  For example, nobody anticipated the decisions made in Germany and their implications.  We have seen what is going on in Britain, which has been engaged for some time in regenerating its nuclear power facilities.  The UK has encountered a great many obstacles and difficulties, and has only recently entered into a contract with the French state company, EDF, to construct a plant at Hinkley Point.  That is going ahead.  We expressed the Irish position, however, and are not alone in doing so.  Member states such as Austria take a stronger view than ours.  There are also issues concerning the EU safety directive, including nuclear liability and stress tests, in all of which we have an interest.  We express those views when the issue is debated at Council level.<\/p><p>  As regards energy infrastructure, the debate on the completion of the internal energy market has been focused on the design of the market, as well as regulatory questions and other difficult technical issues.  The question of infrastructure and building interconnectors between member states is still some distance into the future.  However, one cannot have an integrated market in practice without that interconnection.  We have recently strengthened our interconnection to the neighbouring island with a 500 MW interconnector that was commissioned just over a year ago between Wales and County Meath.  That is a valuable piece of infrastructure which is cited in Europe as an example of what should be happening between member states.  If we are to develop an export capacity exploiting our indigenous resource for the purposes of creating employment and bringing a revenue stream into Ireland by trading green energy with the neighbouring island - and, who knows, maybe further afield in future - then we will have to improve the transmission system.  In any event, the transmission system must be continually refurbished to be fit for purpose.  The concerns raised by members of this committee are the same across Europe.  We have a State agency of acknowledged international competence, which is charged with the delivery of a safe and secure electricity supply system in Ireland.  That agency must have regard to safety issues and best practice, but I accept that it is not without controversy.<\/p><p>  In recent discussions with EirGrid, and conscious of the position adopted by this committee, I took the opportunity to state that there ought to be an extension of the public consultation period for the Grid Link project.  I expressed my own support for that view.  As members of the committee will know, the public consultation period has now been extended to 7 January 2014 in order to give community groups and all citizens an opportunity to make their input.  We will see how it progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700007#F00100","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1385547000,"counter":1365,"content":"<p>I will try not to cover ground that has been dealt with already.

Cyber-security should be at the top of our agenda, given the potential for financial and transactional fraud, electronic identity theft and the leakage of critical data.  I know the Minister will raise these matters at the forthcoming Council meeting.  We have seen some high profile cases recently whereby critical data is getting into the public domain, but it should not happen.  That element of risk needs to be addressed.  I welcome the fact that cyber-security is a high priority for the Minister.  I would be interested to hear of any further developments in that area.<\/p><p>  The Minister noted this committee's concerns about the single telecommunications market.  The committee did agree to a considered opinion.  It is certainly my opinion that the Irish spectrum of the telecommunications network is a national asset.  We need to be careful in any agreements that are reached with our EU partners not to abdicate any control of that network or how it is utilised.  It could have implications for our competitiveness, especially given our peripheral position.  Perhaps the Minister can expand further on that issue.<\/p> <p> Household broadband penetration comes to 65% nationally.  I need not tell the Minister of the importance of equality of access to high quality broadband services.  While I accept that we are a predominantly rural country, we are a small country.  In comparison to other member states, are we achieving favourable access to quality broadband services in the regions?  Quite an investment has been made over the past several years in the MANs, metropolitan area networks, in the larger urban centres.  What is the connectivity of these centres?  It has been identified that Aurora&rsquo;s dark fibre network needs to be extended to Waterford city and region to link up to other MANs in Cork and Dublin, which are coming out of recession.  If we want the regions to come out of recession too, the roll-out of high quality dark fibre broadband infrastructure will be required.  Will the strengthening of telecommunications and broadband infrastructure in the regions be on the agenda of the Council meeting?<\/p><p> I welcome the announcement that the time for the consultation process on the Grid Link project will be extended.  This will allow for more public consultation on the project, as well as submissions.  The Minister referred to the interconnector between Ireland and the UK.  How far has development of the interconnector between Ireland and mainland Europe progressed?  This will be an important element in the import and export of energy into the future.  Energy security and competitiveness are important in optimising our energy resources.<\/p><p> I believe building energy performance is an area in which we are lacking but one in which we are beginning to catch up.  Action No. 44 in Action Plan for Jobs is to establish an energy efficiency fund to support energy efficiency in the public and commercial sectors.  This is an important action to be implemented if we are to reduce our carbon emissions and get the public on board.  We cannot expect various sectors to reduce their carbon emissions when the public sector has not, however.  We need to lead by example in this area.<\/p><p> Another action in the plan relates to a disruptive reform in big data and data analytics.  The plan hopes it will have a direct economic impact and will support the delivery of public services through innovative measures.  This needs to be discussed both domestically and in the European Union, seeking support from our EU partners in areas where there are infrastructural deficits to connect the regions.  The fact the south east does not have Aurora&rsquo;s dark fibre interconnection is putting the region at a disadvantage.  Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, produces top graduates in financial services.  Recently, Deutsche Bank announced that it would be creating thousands of jobs in Dublin.  There is no reason those jobs cannot be created in the regions, providing we have the infrastructural support.  We have the graduates but they are moving to where the infrastructure is located.  We need to get the infrastructure in place to support the regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700007#F00300","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385547600,"counter":1367,"content":"<p>I cannot agree more with Deputy Coffey.  The exciting point about this new technology is that it offers the regions an opportunity for local development that they never had previously.  If we can improve the quality of broadband interconnectivity in provincial Ireland, it will stimulate the creation of local employment that has not been possible in the past 100 years of industrial policy.  It is not that we are suddenly going to start landing major foreign investment projects into remote parts.  There will be some of that but it will be mainly small companies being spawned to provide services of different kinds online while allowing people to live where they were reared.<\/p><p>  The broadband debate at the European Council will not be along the lines that Deputy Coffey has suggested, but it is happening here.  We are in the middle of a detailed mapping exercise which is required as a result of the fact that the commercial sector will not provide high quality bandwidth to the regions.  There is a very healthy and fierce rivalry in urban areas, with high quality service provision which would compete with most EU member states and is better than some.  That is not the case for more than 20% of the population, and due to our population density, a great deal more than 20% of our landmass.  It is certainly not up to what will be needed given the increased uptake and the extraordinary developments in the technology and its applications.<\/p><p>  The MANs initially were slow to catch on.  That is no longer the case, however.  It is no exaggeration to say 50% of them were not lit as recently as two years ago.  That is no longer the case.  The operating franchise recently changed hands, with a new American company in charge.  It is its intention to stimulate further usage of the MANs.  I do not believe the company in question would have made the purchase, which cost it a lot of money, if it did not see market possibilities.<\/p><p>  As a result of the Cabinet approving the requirement for State investment in the south east, we have to comply with state aid rules and make a submission of considerable detail to Brussels.  Every tract of inhabited land is being mapped for this submission.  We are determined to deliver a high quality service to rural areas.  In saying that, I have the support of the Cabinet sub-committee that supervises infrastructure.  We do not think anything about the billions of euro spent on roads, electricity and water provision.  Yet broadband, like the roll-out of electrification in the 1950s, has the capacity to lift rural areas.<\/p><p>  The discussions on the interconnector with France are in the early stages.  It is one of the projects of common interest to which I referred earlier.<\/p><p>  The energy efficiency fund has been established to focus on energy efficiency in public and commercial buildings.  The Department has put &euro;35 million into the fund, with pledges for more than that from the private sector.  Last week, the preferred bidder was approved and the legal provisions are now being put in place.  It will manage the fund.  We will see if we will be able to leverage further private sector funding or use the European Investment Bank as a source of further finance to replenish and increase the fund.<\/p> <p>That decision was approved last week.<\/p><p> I agree with the point about cyber-security and critical infrastructure in particular.  As I mentioned earlier, we have a group equivalent to the computer emergency response teams, or CERTs as they are known in Europe, and we are examining this issue.<\/p><p> In respect of the single telecommunications market, I cannot see any set of circumstances in which we would pool spectrum.  It is a national asset and I cannot see circumstances in which we would want to agree to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700008#G00200","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385548200,"counter":1369,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late arrival.

In a spirit of co-operation, I will work with the Minister and the Department in their stated aim of continued investment in and development of the Bord G&aacute;is energy business and reviewing options for the future of the business.  I have been critical of the Department and Government in respect of the lack of what I would call a real strategy for energy and natural resources.  I have made the point that we tend to respond to business interests rather than take the initiative to do what I believe is the right thing for this country.<\/p><p>  We agree broadly on the key considerations for energy and natural resources.  These are security of supply for this nation; a maximum return for the Irish people in terms of taxation, other income and, critically, employment; and the smooth and non-controversial development of energy and natural resources projects throughout the country.  Sadly, that has not happened to date.  Critical to this issue of smooth and non-controversial project development is not trampling on the rights of coastal communities in a bid to push ahead with what are sometimes badly planned or located developments.  Again, I will work with the Minister on this.

I hope this will be the first of many constructive engagements with him and his colleagues.  Many of the issues I will mention in my presentations are live in both the Telecommunications and Energy Councils and the Minister has covered them to some extent in his presentation.  The Department has a wide economic brief and is responsible for policy formulation and implementation in the key national areas of communications, including broadband and digital media, energy, broadcasting, postal services and exploration and mining.  The formulation and implementation of public policy in these areas of the economy are fundamental to sustainable economic development and job creation.  These are critical economic sectors and there is a heavy and ongoing European agenda across most of them.<\/p><p>  While I was invited by the committee to discuss the 2012 reports, I would also like to take the opportunity to brief the members on the successful 2013 Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  While this predated my arrival in the Department, I know from my own experience of chairing the environment working group in Brussels for Ireland's 2004 Presidency the detailed planning, sound execution and absolute commitment of staff required to deliver such a successful Presidency in the first half of this year.<\/p><p>  I will begin with the energy agenda.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a regulation on guidelines for a trans-European energy infrastructure was progressed in the energy working group under the Danish Presidency in the first half of last year.  Published in October 2011, the proposal was part of the Commission's comprehensive package to enhance trans-European infrastructure development in transport, energy and information society.  The proposal replaced the existing financing regulation for major energy projects and aimed at delivering energy market integration and completing the internal energy market.  A progress report was also provided at the June Council on the regulation on safety in offshore drilling adopted by the Commission in October 2011.  The objectives of the regulation were to ensure consistent use of best practice for major hazards control; to implement best regulatory practices in all EU jurisdictions, ensuring no conflict of interest between regulatory activities for safety and the environment and the economic development of offshore natural resources; to strengthen preparedness and response capacity to deal with emergencies; and to improve liability and compensation provisions.<\/p><p>  The Commission adopted a communication on a strategy for renewable energy on 6 June 2012 and presented it at the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy, TTE, Council in June.  The communication outlined several renewable policy options for the period beyond 2020 and emphasised the importance of the integration of renewables into the energy market.  It also called for a more co-ordinated European approach in the establishment and reform of support schemes and increased use of renewable energy trading among member states.<\/p><p>  There was one Energy Council in December 2012 under the Cyprus Presidency, which made further progress on the regulation on safety in offshore oil and gas drilling.  Most of the provisions were agreed in Council working group and an initial trilogue with the European Parliament was held at the end of November 2012.  The completion of the agreement between member states and the negotiation of the file with the Parliament was passed to the Irish Presidency.  Council conclusions were adopted by Ministers at the December Council on the Commission's communication on a strategy for renewable energy. <\/p><p>  There were two Energy Councils and one informal meeting of energy ministers under the Irish Presidency.  The Councils took place on 22 February in Brussels and 7 June in Luxembourg.  An informal meeting of energy ministers was held in Dublin Castle on 23 and 24 April.  The main proposal covered under the Energy Councils was the amending directive on the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, which amends both the renewable energy and fuel directives.  The Minister discussed this with members earlier.  The discussion on the file during the Irish Presidency led to general agreement that the risk of food and feed production being displaced for the production of biofuels is a serious issue that needs to be tackled.  There was general support for the proposal and the Commission's objectives to promote the use of advanced biofuels to meet climate targets.  There was a policy debate on the Commission's communication, Making the Internal Energy Market Work, and a general consensus that the implementation of the third package and the development of energy infrastructure, including cross-border, are essential for the completion of the internal energy market and to ensure energy security.<\/p><p>  Following constructive negotiations by the Cyprus and Irish Presidencies of the Council and the European Parliament, the proposal for a regulation on safety in offshore oil and gas prospecting, exploration and production activities was adopted by the Council and the Parliament at the end of the Irish Presidency.  This is key legislation which has as its central objectives the following: to ensure the consistent use of best practices for major hazard control by offshore oil and gas operators; to strengthen the EU&rsquo;s preparedness and response capacity to deal with emergencies potentially affecting EU citizens or the environment; and to improve and clarify existing Union liability and compensation provisions.<\/p><p>  A number of important issues were discussed at the informal Energy Council meeting in Dublin, including better control of energy consumption through smart technologies.  This discussion focussed on the interaction of ICT, energy and innovation, and how to achieve better control of consumption through smart technologies.  There was also an initial discussion on unconventional oil and gas and the effects on energy supply, competitiveness and prices at the informal Council.  It was clear from the wide-ranging discussion and divergent views that these are early days in the discussion and that Europe is facing both opportunities and risks, which will vary depending on how the EU manages the framework for development.  Such a framework would need to respect the environment and ensure public consultation and public acceptance of any emerging proposals in this area.<\/p><p>  The informal Council also focused on identifying the barriers to financing energy efficiency.  Presentations were also made on the economic effects of the integration of intermittent renewable sources into the grid.  Member states noted the need for physical grid build-out and completion of market integration and that storage capacity needs to be built up to ensure intermittency is carefully and adequately managed.  The joint lunchtime discussion by energy and environment Ministers at the informal Council was on the Commission&rsquo;s Green Paper on the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework, which initiated a policy development process and provided a basis for a focused debate on shaping the framework for a new climate and energy package for the period to 2030.  The primary aim of the Green Paper was to consult stakeholders to obtain evidence and views to support development of the 2030 framework.  <\/p><p>  It has also been a progressive 18 months in the Telecommunications Council.  The Danish Presidency prioritised the proposal for a regulation on roaming on mobile telephone networks in the first six months of 2012 and reached an agreement with Parliament at first reading at the end of March.  This proposal aims to bring competition into the roaming market through structural measures that will enable alternative operators to provide roaming services to consumers using the networks of the main operators.  It also reduces further the wholesale and retail charges for voice, SMS and data services and introduces retail price caps for data roaming.  The regulation came into effect on 1 July 2012.<\/p><p>  The Danish Presidency also focused on two other legislative files: the amending directive on the re-use of public sector information, known as the PSI directive, and the regulation on guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks, known as the CEF telecommunications guidelines.  Both files were taken forward by the Danish Presidency and the Cypriot Presidency, which also identified the regulation concerning the European Network and Information Security Agency, ENISA, as a priority proposal.  The Minister set out at the end of last year the incoming Irish Presidency priorities of reaching agreement with Parliament on the ENISA regulation, the PSI directive and the CEF telecommunications guidelines.  Agreement was reached on the first two files by the end of the Presidency.  The purpose of the CEF telecommunications guidelines was to establish a series of guidelines covering the objectives and priorities envisaged for broadband and digital service infrastructures in the telecommunications sector.  Considerable progress was being made on this proposal under the Irish Presidency up to the end of February.  In March, the European Council reduced the funding available for the sector from &euro;9 billion to &euro;1 billion, following which the Commission withdrew the proposal for reconsideration.  Following lengthy internal discussions, a revised proposal was presented by the Commission at the end of May, which was too late for further work on the proposal under the Irish Presidency.  Political agreement was achieved earlier this month.  Agreement has also been reached on the umbrella CEF regulation and the other two sectoral guidelines in transport and energy.<\/p><p>  Work was also substantially advanced under the Irish Presidency on the regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market, also known as the eIDAS, eID authentication and signing, proposal.<\/p> <p>The purpose of this proposal is to enhance security and trust in online transactions and to encourage the provision and use of online services requiring electronic identification throughout the EU.  This complex technical file was examined on 12 occasions in the Council working party during the Irish Presidency.  In addition, two seminars on specific aspects of the proposal were held by the Presidency in conjunction with the Commission.  Significant progress was achieved on the sections dealing with electronic identification and a substantial progress report was presented at the TTE Council in June. <\/p><p> With regard to the TTE Council, Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency concluded with a highly successful digital agenda assembly which was held in Dublin Castle on 19 and 20 June.  This was the first time the event had been held outside Brussels, and it was attended by more than 600 delegates, with a further 4,000 following it online.  The assembly programme had a strong emphasis on digital skills, entrepreneurship and growth.  The workshops that were held focused on ICT skills and jobs, public services, research and innovation, trust and security, entrepreneurship and the digital single market.<\/p><p> Since the conclusion of the Irish Presidency, the Commission published in September one of the most ambitious regulations in the telecommunications sector in the last five years - the proposal concerning the European single market for electronic communications and to achieve a connected Continent.  The committee was briefed by the Department on the proposed regulation in October.  The Commission&rsquo;s aim is that the draft regulation be adopted by the Legislature by April 2014, when this Parliament&rsquo;s term will end.  At the October European Council, Heads of Government and State called for an intensive examination of the proposal with a view to its timely adoption.  It is clear that member states will require more time to analyse and consult on this far-reaching regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700010#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385549400,"counter":1386,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Griffin.

Given where we need to be in broadband communications and the digital agenda in coming years, we have an opportunity to make some critical decisions on the delivery of broadband within our State.  This is an EU-wide issue.  There is a digital agenda for Europe that envisages that by 2013 all citizens will have access to a basic level of broadband, which Ireland has achieved.  It has a much higher target to be achieved by 2020.<\/p><p>  As the Minister outlined earlier, we have a pretty well-supported broadband sector in the major cities and towns.  We have good competition among Eircom, UPC and Sky at this stage.  The situation is not as good in rural areas and we all accept that needs to be addressed.  The Government covered its broadband strategy last year, which identified the need for targeted Government investment in the provision of broadband in those areas that will not be supported by the commercial market.  The Department has commenced a mapping exercise to identify the areas to which the commercial operators will provide broadband.  By definition, that will identify areas in which the State needs to intervene.<\/p><p>  In recent months the state aid guidelines have changed, requiring a rethink on the nature of the intervention on our part, and that work is still under way.  It is a problem for all member states and one we want to ensure we get right in the next 12 months or so, in order that we can, as the Government says, make this country the best small country in the world in which to do business.  That is a critical component of the infrastructure needed to do that.<\/p><p>  Still on the digital theme, the Department's digital strategy published earlier this year outlines the scale of investment that is being made online by Irish people.  Approximately &euro;4 billion was spent last year, of which approximately 70% went outside the State.  That is a real challenge for us in how we position small businesses in the State to gear up in order to have an online presence.  They need to be able to conduct transactions online and recover some of that business.  Even if they only recover 10% of it, the economy would benefit from &euro;280 or &euro;300 million.  If the level of ambition is set higher, it would have much greater benefit for the Department.  There is also a huge risk.  If we do not make the right decisions in the coming years on the digital economy, there is a real risk that a much greater proportion of retail trade will be transacted online, with a consequential impact on Irish businesses, jobs and the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  The renewable energy agenda is another area where there are developments at EU level and nationally.  There are EU targets for renewable energy to be achieved by 2020.<\/p> <p>We have set ourselves an ambition of 40% of electricity generation from renewable energies by 2020 and we are well on target to achieve this.  We are slightly beyond 20% at this stage, which is a significant achievement for the State and the people active in the sector.  When one considers the fact the State relies heavily on the importation of fossil fuels to run our generation businesses, it is critical we have another avenue in terms of the fuel source, and the fact we have invested so much in the development of the renewable energy sector will pay off in due course.<\/p><p> Our energy efficiency ambitions are quite significant.  Targets are set at EU level.  The Minister mentioned in his intervention the fact we will put the energy efficiency fund in place quite quickly.  We have an ambitious energy efficiency target to achieve in the public sector of 33% by 2020, and we have significant targets in the private sector.  Substantial investment has been made by the Government in retrofit programmes and the better energy homes and better energy warmer homes schemes, which as well as having an impact on the energy efficiency agenda and delivering the targets are also very beneficial from an economic development and job creation perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700011#K00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385550000,"counter":1395,"content":"<p>I wish Mr. Griffin well in his new role, which is very challenging given what he has outlined.  There is no doubt much work has gone into setting EU and national policy with regard to the roll-out of communications and energy infrastructure.  The strategies have been put in place but the difficult part is implementation.  We all agree this is where the main challenges will be, and we see this with EirGrid.  We also need public acceptance for the energy infrastructure, and this will be ongoing.<\/p><p>  With regard to the renewable energy targets which have been set, are we putting all our eggs in one basket and all our hopes on the wind energy sector or are we trying to develop other areas such as wave, tidal and hydro energy?  I have mentioned that more than 150 years ago in my home town, 300 kW of power were generated from the local river Clodagh.  Not 1 kW is generated from the river now.  One must consider the opportunities and potential for small micro projects which would heighten public awareness and get community engagement in renewable energies.  Some focus should be on this as well as on large economic investment projects such as wind energy projects. We should not give up on this area.  Communities could get involved in other smaller projects.  Is anything being done in this regard at departmental level to try to get buy-in through schools or communities?<\/p><p>  With regard to energy efficiency in homes, smart metering was a buzzword a few years ago.  Where is it now?  For a very small investment a household could have a meter to indicate exact consumption at particular times.  A pilot project was proposed a number of years ago.  Is it intended to roll this out in communities to give people better understanding?  No matter what policies are adopted at the highest levels, unless we have public engagement and public awareness we will find it very difficult to implement them across the board.  Human behaviour must change, and this goes for the private and public sectors.  I suspect much poor practice occurs with regard to building management and energy efficiency in the public sector.  In many public buildings the heating may be on full blast and there may also be air conditioning trying to cool down the heating.  Public buildings may have conflicting energy efficiency models.  This is an area we can certainly work on and big savings are to be achieved not only to the public purse but also in reducing carbon emissions.  I would like to hear Mr. Griffin's views on this.<\/p><p>  I spoke to the Minister about broadband and the assets we have, such as metropolitan area networks and semi-State agencies such as EirGrid, which I understand has telecommunication fibre wrapped around its main transmission networks running throughout the country.  I understand Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann also has telecommunication networks.  How are EirGrid, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the metropolitan area networks co-ordinated?  What connects them to ensure we get the best value from this asset in order that we sweat it to the maximum potential?  These are all semi-State or State agencies and we need a body or agency co-ordinating this to ensure we get the maximum benefit from existing assets.<\/p><p>  I welcome planned investment and I mentioned the Aurora dark fibre network which we need in the south east if we are to be competitive.  This needs to continue and I hope we get the capital resources to invest in it.  In this respect I ask Mr. Griffin whether this specific investment must come from the public purse or whether public private partnerships are possible in the roll-out of this type of infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700012#L00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385550000,"counter":1396,"content":"<p>I will take the last question first.   Deputy Coffey is correct with regard to broadband and the fact so much infrastructure is in place in the State sector.  The 2012 broadband plan contained an intention to examine the totality of the infrastructure which existed in the State sector, whether in the Office of Public Works, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Bord G&aacute;is or the Department because apparently the Department owns ducts throughout the country, which was a great surprise to me when I joined the Department.  A substantial amount of this work has been undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700012#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1385550000,"counter":1397,"content":"<p>Did Mr. Griffin say \"ducks\" or \"ducts\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700012#L00400","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385550000,"counter":1398,"content":"<p>I said \"ducts\" but it would not surprise me if we had the occasional duck or hen around the place either.  A considerable amount of work has been done on the issue by NewERA.  The work is not finalised but it is beginning to show that a substantial amount of infrastructure is in State ownership, spread throughout a range of State agencies, and we need to examine this to see how to leverage it in the development of State intervention.  In so far as how this State intervention would be funded, we are examining whether the Exchequer would need to commit to it exclusively or whether it could be funded or part-funded by the infrastructure fund or the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, and whether pension funds would be interested in getting involved in the business.  This is contingent on how commercial a proposition it is.  The NPRF and the Irish strategic investment fund will invest on the basis a proposition is commercial and there will be a commercial return.  It may well be some of the interventions we must make are not commercial by nature.  We need to examine this.  It is an issue in which the Department is heavily engaged at present.<\/p><p>  With regard to the renewable energy sector and whether we are putting all our eggs in the large project basket, the big interventions will be in wind energy and we have seen many of these projects put in place.  Significant investment has been made in wind energy in recent years and at present we have approximately 2,100 MW installed wind capacity.  We need approximately 3,500 MW or 4,000 MW to meet our 2020 targets, so there is still a bit of headroom in terms of what needs to be achieved.  Through the Gate 3 process we have enough planned capacity to meet our 2020 targets.<\/p><p>  Deputy Coffey is correct that there are potentially significant opportunities in offshore, wave and tidal energy.<\/p> <p>The Minister will shortly publish an offshore renewable energy development plan which will consider what needs to be done to enable the conditions for effective offshore wave and tidal capacity as well as offshore wind capacity.  We have committed moneys from the Department's Vote to ocean research development and demonstration projects.  We will have spent &euro;26.3 million by 2016, an increase of &euro;16.8 million on what was originally budgeted, on development sites, for example, the Coastal and Marine Research Centre, CMRC, in Cork and the Marine Institute test sites in Cork and Galway.  Investment has been made and more is to come.  We are hopeful there will be significant developments in this field during the coming years.<\/p><p> The Deputy raised the issue of public awareness.  As a principle, I am supportive of public awareness.  Interventions need to be targeted.  There was some criticism of what was delivered by the Power of One campaign of a number of years ago.  The Department has lessons to learn about the effectiveness of that process.  The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, also has an awareness dimension.<\/p><p> I understand the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has embarked on an awareness campaign in recent weeks to promote the availability of retrofit grants.  We have secured additional money for that purpose in 2014.  The SEAI wants to communicate to householders the fact these grant schemes exist, how to access them and their value to householders.<\/p><p> The general issue of public consultation is critical, given the reaction of communities in recent months to the proposed export project in the midlands.  For example, communities have expressed concerns about the Grid Link project.  Public consultation is a fundamental principle underpinning the Government's approach.  One need only read the policy statement published by the Minister last year on behalf of the Government that made crystal clear the importance of ensuring early and adequate engagement with communities.  My opinion is the agencies involved need to overcommunicate.  One cannot communicate or engage enough with communities.  The concerns that have been expressed are genuine and need to be addressed.<\/p><p> Committee members will be aware the Department started a public consultation process in October on the planning framework that will surround the export project if an intergovernmental agreement is concluded by the Irish and British Governments.  The deadline for the first phase was last Friday.  As of late last week, we had received 200 submissions, which is great.  It is important that people have an opportunity to engage on this project.  There will be at least two further stages of consultation as part of the programme.  A strategic environmental assessment and an appropriate assessment will also be undertaken.  A robust planning framework will be put in place to allow the public full access to the consultation process.  This is important and the steps taken by the Department in this regard have been constructive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700012#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385550600,"counter":1400,"content":"<p>On a point of clarification, Mr. Griffin's definition of \"consultation\", my definition and that of the communities might differ.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700013#M00200","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385550600,"counter":1401,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013112700013#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1385550600,"counter":1402,"content":"<p>Consultation depends on the extent to which options are open or closed.
