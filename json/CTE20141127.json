There are two conflicting opinions, but both are simply opinions.  We will not get a definitive answer until the issue is tested in the courts.  One of the key concerns last week was the scope of the protection.  It was decided a risk analysis, covering both the committee and Mr. Ryan, would be carried out before any decision was made on bringing Mr. Ryan before the committee.  This was the decision taken last week and it still obtains.<\/p><p>  We will hear from Revenue next week and we have the letter from the Minister on the information Mr. Ryan gleaned from the Companies Acts, which has all gone to Revenue.  Therefore, Revenue should have all the information.  It is for the committee to decide if it wants to or not.  In looking at the risks, which is what the committee decided to do last week, we will have to see what the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 protects this individual from.  This is especially so in the context of the Companies Acts because they have specific penalties in terms of giving information to anyone other than designated people.  This is my understanding of the situation.  I have had just a preliminary discussion with those in the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser.  When the Parliamentary Legal Adviser was here, we asked if we could forward the dossier to Revenue.  We were told we could not.  The Chairman then wrote to the Minister about this.  It is information gathered under an investigation under section 19.  The Act offers very limited scope on where it can be sent.  All of this will have to be thrashed out with our legal people.  Whether the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 applies and whether it protects the individual will have to be examined again.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700004#C00700","nonspeaker":"Clerk to the Committee"},{"type":"speech","time":1417083000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The concern is that, even before carrying out the necessary risk assessment, there are not only two different views but absolutely conflicting views.

That causes me concern.  We do not want to jeopardise Mr. Ryan, in the first instance, or the committee.  However, it makes more sense if clarity is obtained on that issue first.  Whatever about a difference in interpretation, to have legislation that is amenable to such radically different interpretations suggests there is a problem with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700004#C00800","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1417083000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Yesterday, at a meeting of various Chairmen of committees in this House, I raised that issue and asked that the legal section in this House would carry out an overview of the legislation, which is related to the case before us and the whistleblower.  In the case of Mr. Ryan, I do not think it is clearly understood what the legislation has brought about.  It has left him using legislation under which he thought he was covered.  The legal adviser to the House that passed the legislation tells us he is not covered under it.  It is unfair to Mr. Ryan to have a standoff between the respective legal advisers.  Clarity should be obtained by this House.  The submission has been made to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I support the idea of asking the parliamentary legal adviser to seek a second opinion on both sets of legal advice.  Having regard to the overall work of the House, there appears to be a stand off at almost every turn on legal advice being sought and given and the direction that committees are being asked to take.  I understand we have to protect the committee and the House, but we also have to do our work.  It appears to me that we are being tied up in a legal tangle that does not allow the work within the remit of this committee to flow as freely as it should.  It will also impact on other committees.  We have to seek clarification.  We should get another view on this and a view from the Attorney General on the legislation itself.  The committees in the House have to be allowed to do their work.  We have to be allowed to progress within the set limits.  However, we need clarification when things like this happen.

For the purposes of carrying out our work, as described by the Chairman, but perhaps more important for the sake of Mr. Ryan himself, we need to know if he is covered by the legislation.

We made decisions as a committee last week.  It seems that when a decision is made, we come back the following week and question that decision and find ourselves on a completely different course.

My understanding of what happened last week was that the legal advisers were to be here today to reiterate their advice on the specific issue of the whistleblower's attendance and the implications for him personally.  We did it that way because the Comptroller and Auditor General made the point that if we had the whistleblower before the committee it might compound things negatively.

It operates its own racing activities through 11 subsidiary companies, and licenses greyhound racing at other privately owned tracks.  In recent years, it has received annual State funding of around &euro;11 million from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  The level of State funding is anticipated to increase in 2015.<\/p><p>  The main project undertaken by Bord na gCon under its 2007-10 capital programme was the development of a new racing stadium and administration headquarters building in Limerick.  The project was completed in October 2010.  Subsequently, concerns were raised publicly about certain aspects of the project, resulting in media reports and correspondence to this committee.  In the course of the audit of the 2011 financial statements, we sought to examine the evolution of the project, and its impact on Bord na gCon&rsquo;s financial position.  Because the issues were complex, we were unable to conclude that the project had been delivered in a satisfactory way, and continued the examination in parallel with the audit of the 2012 financial statements.  Members will recall the discussion about the stadium last November with the representatives of Bord na gCon in the context of examination of those financial statements.  I felt it was necessary to present a report to allow finalisation of the matter by the committee and to address the public's concerns.<\/p><p>  Redevelopment or replacement of the existing Markets Field stadium in Limerick had been contemplated since around 2000.  Although public bodies are required to assess the business case for capital projects, we did not find evidence of any formal appraisal underpinning the decision to construct a new stadium on a greenfield site rather than to redevelop the existing stadium.  At a public auction in April 2005, Bord na gCon bought a 16-acre site in Meelick, on the outskirts of the city.  The purchase price was just over &euro;1 million, and further expenditure totalling &euro;935,000 was incurred on stamp duty, site investigations and development, and project planning and design fees.  Prior to the auction, a firm of consultants hired by Bord na gCon identified a potential problem in relation to site access, and the fact that the Meelick site fronted a national road.  There is no evidence that the consultants&rsquo; report was presented to or discussed by the board in advance of the site purchase.  Subsequently, Bord na gCon dropped its planning application to develop the new stadium at Meelick, due to anticipated planning difficulties over access.  The site at Meelick is still held by the board, and was valued at end 2012 at &euro;150,000.  A total of &euro;1.6 million spent on site purchase and subsequent development and planning costs has been written off.<\/p><p>  In June 2008, the board purchased an alternative site of 11.5 acres at Greenpark at a cost of &euro;3.4 million or &euro;304,900 per acre.  Bord na gCon had commissioned a valuation of those lands in 2003.  This indicated a value of &euro;160,000 per acre would be reasonable at that time.  Despite a 91% increase in price per acre and a number of major changes in the site characteristics between 2003 and 2008, a fresh valuation was not sought at the time of the purchase.<\/p><p>  When the board approved the purchase of the Greenpark lands, it was informed that the vendor would construct the car park for use by members of the public attending racing or other events, on the basis that it would also be available for use as an overflow car park for a nearby commercial development.  The board was also told that the developer would provide necessary fill for the site at no cost to the board, subject to a landfill licence being granted.  These features of the deal on offer could have reduced the overall cost of the development.  In the event, these aspects of the deal did not work out as planned and Bord na gCon incurred additional costs and risks.   <\/p><p>  Department of Public Expenditure and Reform rules for capital projects require the preparation of a formal appraisal in advance of substantial commitments being made to a capital project.  An initial capital project evaluation was presented to the board in June 2008.  An updated evaluation was presented to the board in April 2009.  This projected an excess of net project revenues of &euro;1.4 million, in net present value terms, based on a capital investment of &euro;19.8 million.  My examination found that there was a lack of thoroughness in the manner in which this appraisal was undertaken by Bord na gCon.  In particular, despite available evidence that revenues from greyhound racing activity were falling in 2008-09, high racing revenue was forecast for Limerick.  As a result the projected net revenues from the operation of the Limerick track appear to have been overstated by an estimated &euro;2.9 million in net present value terms.  This was in contrast to the expenditure side of the analysis, which took account of the fall in construction prices being experienced in 2008-2009.  In addition, cash from property disposals accounted for over one third of the total projected project revenues, and these were not backed up by current valuations, despite falling property prices.  Finally, sensitivity analysis of the results did not appear to have been carried out.  This would have allowed the board to identify that the commercial viability of the project was heavily dependent on the assumptions around increases in tote betting contribution and track profit at Limerick.<\/p><p>  The outturn on the project has been that profits from the track operation and the Tote at Limerick have been well below the levels projected and are forecast to remain so in the period to 2015.  For example, the evaluation projected profits in Limerick of &euro;800,000 in 2011, increasing to &euro;1 million by 2015.  In fact, Limerick generated a surplus of &euro;208,000 in 2011, and recorded a loss of &euro;107,000 in 2012.  The stadium was at break-even in 2013.<\/p><p>  My main conclusion is that had better analysis been done and more soundly-based assumptions used, it is likely that the analysis would have indicated that the Limerick stadium development was marginal in commercial terms.  There might nevertheless have been strategic arguments in the interests of the greyhound industry in favour of proceeding with the project, or a scaled-back development, but in pursuing such a course, the board should have recognised that the project might adversely affect its financial position.  In the end, Bord na gCon spent a total of &euro;21 million on the development at Greenpark, including the site purchase at Greenpark, stamp duty and irrecoverable VAT.  As indicated in the figure displayed on the screen to the committee, its borrowings increased from under &euro;10 million in 2007 to around &euro;22 million in 2012.  Over the same period, its operating profits have declined from about &euro;6 million a year to about &euro;3 million a year.  The chief executive officer will be able to brief the committee on the steps being taken to reduce the borrowing level and address the longer-term sustainability of Bord na gCon&rsquo;s operations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700006#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417084800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>It is a year since the Irish Greyhound Board appeared before the committee.  Since then, we have had a number of significant reviews of matters of concern to the committee and to the board.  The Comptroller and Auditor General report into the Limerick project, the construction of the new greyhound stadium and Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, headquarters, was published last October.  It is clear from the report that over the timeframe of the entire project, from its conception in 2000 to its delivery in 2010, there were issues of concern to the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General found that the project, notwithstanding that there may have been a case for undertaking it, was not subject to appropriate capital appraisal, particularly at a time in 2008 when IGB profits from its activities were declining, the year before the decision to proceed with the project was taken.  This is, rightly, of concern to the Committee of Public Accounts and also very much to the IGB, which has inherited the consequences of the decision to proceed.  There is a double impact here.  Apart from the management of the finances arising from the Limerick project, its profile has meant that it has absorbed massive amounts of staff time.  It has damaged staff and organisational morale, affected our relationships with some stakeholders and to this day has badly affected the IGB's capacity to focus on the future.  There is a major opportunity cost.<\/p><p>  The IGB accepts the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General report and has implemented its recommendations.  Since we last met, the independent review of the greyhound industry and IGB commissioned by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Tom Hayes, has been carried out by economic consultancy Indecon.  The IGB welcomed the commissioning of the report on an industry that was, and is, under pressure and on which commentary was generating a lot more heat than light.  Indecon pointed out that the IGB faces many challenges in its efforts to restore financial stability and sustainability to the organisation.  It was also prescriptive in its recommendations, to which the board has responded in great detail and in a time-lined fashion.<\/p><p>  The board believes the Indecon report can make a very significant contribution to a re-energising and restructuring of the greyhound industry.  The board hopes the publication of the report will be a defining moment and will facilitate closer working relationships with all stakeholders.  Notwithstanding our current difficulties, the board shares the confidence of the consultants that with the implementation of the report's recommendations and the continued support of the Minister and Government, there is a positive future for the industry ahead.  However, it will be hard-won, and the board and executive are under no illusions about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700007#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Meaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1417084800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>May we publish Mr. Meany's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700007#F00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417084800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Meaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417084800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General's review of the Limerick project raises serious concerns about the adequacy of the analysis informing the decision to proceed with the project.  It accepts that there may have been strategic arguments in favour of proceeding with the project or with a less expensive development and concludes that the board should have recognised the project might adversely affect its financial position, if proceeded with at that time.  That has come to pass.  Our financial position has been seriously affected and that is the reality we now find ourselves in.<\/p><p>  It would be remiss of me, as chief executive, not to point out to members that no one representing the organisation here today was involved with the Limerick project, whose genesis goes back to 2000.  That is not intended to be a special pleading on my part.  It is simply a fact that we were not privy to the discussions that took place at the time.  Nor were we part of the contract negotiations, the sanction of borrowings or the supervision of the construction phase.  While we have, as best we can, familiarised ourselves with detail from the files, ours is, at the very best, a remote and inadequate view and is limited as a result.<\/p><p>  The current board and executive have the responsibility to deal with the legacy of the Limerick decisions.  The implications of those have been compounded by the economic environment which coincided with the project.  We are, in a sense, dealing with a perfect storm.  We are servicing the additional borrowings arising from the Limerick project and endeavouring to manage an industry that faces many other challenges, some of the most acute of which have arisen from the impacts of the recession.  Disposable income has come crashing down, affecting all our income streams, namely, gate receipts, food and beverage income, tote and sponsorship.  While IGB has always carried borrowings, these have been doubled as a result of the Limerick project.  While IGB has never breached any bank covenants, repayment of debt is our biggest challenge.  The Indecon report states that this issue, not operational day-to-day cash flow, represents the biggest problem for IGB.<\/p><p>  The issues we face are complex and even if we did not have significant legacy issues to manage, there are many other challenges.  In the first instance, we need to stimulate, energise and restore confidence of the core elements of the industry, the foundations on which the industry is based.  We need to increase the number of owners, breeders and trainers.  We need larger dog pools to sustain the industry and ensure the quality of racing is such that it attracts not just an indigenous audience, but an international one.  All of this must take place within a robust and clearly understood regulatory and welfare framework.  We are in the entertainment industry, competing for discretionary income with other sports and hospitality venues.  New technology, changes in consumer tastes and new demographics are all part of the challenge.  To meet it, new product development, the exploitation of the global opportunities from streaming, getting more value from our assets, new forms of track ownership and operation and the rationalisation of tracks all have to be considered.<\/p><p>  As the IGB chairman said, we have submitted a detailed, time-lined response to the Indecon report.  My obligation as chief executive is to restore the financial stability of the organisation and to oversee a transformation across IGB governance, regulation and welfare.  It is a daunting task.  If this industry is to survive and prosper, it will require tough decisions, ongoing assessment of the business model, the development of new income streams, and openness to new approaches across the sector.  Together with the board and all industry stakeholders, the decisions will be made so as to ensure the long-term sustainability of the industry.  The issues facing the industry are so pressing that leaving matters as they are is no longer an option for anyone involved.  I hope we can demonstrate to committee members that the strategy now at work in IGB can deliver significant change and improvement and thereby best protect the State's interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700007#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1417084800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>May we publish Ms Larkin's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700007#F00500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417084800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>You may, indeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700007#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1417084800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I welcome everybody here, both from Bord na gCon and the Department.

Harold's Cross and Shelbourne Park are very much part of the Dublin landscape and it is a very serious matter.  I have carefully examined the briefing the IGB provided, the Comptroller and Auditor General's statement, which was a very strong and robust analysis of what has happened over recent years, the current situation and how we are moving forward, and what the chairman and CEO said today.  I see some mixed messages in the report and what the chairman and CEO said today.  The statements recognise the harsh, cold, dire realities of the situation.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has indicated that at least &euro;4 million in costs could have been avoided in the projects to which we refer.  The average attendance was the same in 2012 and 2013, 392 per race, and is clearly unsustainable.<\/p> <p>There was a 32% reduction in greyhound ownership in Ireland between 2007 and 2013.  Between 2008 and 2013 the debt doubled from &euro;10.4 million to &euro;21.8 million.  There was a pensions deficit in 2012 of &euro;8.6 million.  These are serious matters.  Bord na gCon is only paying interest on the debt and there is no indication of when the principal will be repaid.  The witnesses tell us that next year they hope to restructure the debt.  It is stated on page 3 of the briefing that the Irish Greyhound Board has reached agreement with its bank on the restructuring of loan facilities and that the agreement will come into effect once the security held by the bank has been legally perfected, whatever that means.  There is no indication of how much of the principal will be repaid.  Will the witnesses clarify whether repayment will continue on an interest-only basis?<br\/>I am concerned that following the reference in the briefing document to the restructuring of loan facilities there is a paragraph with wishful thinking:<blockquote>As outlined the financial statements for 2013 continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.  While the forecasted profits projected from new income streams did not materialise in 2014 due in principle to reconciliation of information technology platforms, IGB remain confident that significant returns will be generated for the industry over future years from secured contracts with co-mingling partners and supply of live racing pictures to the wagering market.  IGB are currently finalising contracts with an established tv provider within the wagering industry and have contracts with some of the largest wagering partners that are due to commence during quarter 1 2015.  IGB are encouraged by the support and financial commitment made by these wagering outlets for their future use of the IGB racing product.  The demand for the Irish greyhound racing product is greatly enhanced with the badge of a semi-State organisation.<\/blockquote>What does &quot;due in principle&quot; mean?  This paragraph is nothing but waffle, making tentative references to &quot;confidence&quot; about &quot;future years&quot;.  This is all wishful thinking.  The reality is the level of greyhound ownership is down, track attendances are down and the Tote take is down.  We received clear and realistic statements from the CEO and the chairman stating the situation was bleak.  The chairman says staff morale and relations with stakeholders have been damaged and that this has badly affected the capacity of the Irish Greyhound Board to focus on the future.  We are receiving mixed messages.  It is suggested everything will be hunky-dory in the future, but the reality today looks serious.  Will the witnesses address this issue?<br\/>I do not like being told that there is a new board that cannot take responsibility for things that happened under the old one.  The suggestion is that we must accept the legacy of the old board, while acknowledging that the new one is not at fault.  Representatives of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board were before the committee three weeks ago and the board had impaired debts of around &euro;40 million.  To a large extent, it blamed the old board, but this is not good enough in the case of a commercial semi-State body that must operate on an ongoing basis.

It is very clear, both within the document and then in a summary appendix at the back of the document, how exactly we are going to hit each of the recommendations.<\/p><p>  Specifically, Deputy Costello talked about asset disposal and the consideration around Harold's Cross.  I have two things to put forward in reply to that.  First of all, when the board and the executive were formulating the response to the Indecon report, obviously we looked at what other proposals might be considered rather than an asset disposal of Harold's Cross.  The proposals put forward by the executive included a review of all the stadiums that are currently under the control of Irish Greyhound Board, looking at them from the perspective of operational performance, operational surpluses, the freehold or leasehold arrangements on particular sites or stadiums, and, indeed, the particular zoning attached to each one.  After that analysis, and, indeed, looking at the surplus that is generated on an annual basis by Harold's Cross and doing a projection on those figures, it was on that basis that the board decided to proceed with the sale of Harold's Cross.  While Harold's Cross is in profit - to the tune of &euro;200,000 in 2013 - the reality of the situation the IGB is in is that its debts are far greater than any continued operation of Harold's Cross would realise, assuming we can dispose of the asset with full zoning.<\/p><p>  It also has to be considered that, while I accept what Deputy Costello is saying in-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700010#J01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1417086600,"counter":136,"content":"<p>For what purpose is Bord na gCon looking for it to be rezoned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700010#J01700","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417086600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>In terms of realising maximum value from the sale of the asset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700010#J01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1417086600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Has Bord na gCon submitted a proposal for that?

If Bord na gCon does not get it rezoned, of course, the value it expects from the site is hugely diminished, because it is of no value unless it is rezoned for the purpose it seeks.  It is those matters that need to be teased out carefully, and then we can consider whether it is desirable that a profitable race track should be disposed of, whether the new unit in Dublin is the way forward, whether the same racegoers who went to Harold's Cross will now go to Shelbourne Park - as it is a different clientele that goes to the two race courses - and whether what has been successful to date might be best to build on.<\/p> <p>These aspects are very relevant to the sustainability of Bord na gCon and its future activities.

One of the key issues for the IGB and for the industry is that we will need to target money where it is giving the best return for the industry.  In that vein, we have proposed in our response to Indecon to start measuring the performance of each individual track.  That measurement will not be solely financial.  In addition to financial measurements, we will also be considering from an industry perspective the relative size of the dog pool within each area, the relative attendance at each stadium, the level of sponsorship attracted to each stadium, growth and development and the local involvement at each stadium.  We will also consider the level and state of development of a stadium so that we are not comparing an undeveloped stadium with one that has received significant capital investment.  Over time, these figures will give us a much better overview as to where we are getting best value for the taxpayers&rsquo; money.  In the short term we will work with stadiums in order to explain and evaluate these metrics.  However, the reality is that we have to focus prize money and our subvention on those tracks that are contributing the most back to the industry.  If we do not realise the asset sale, or if the expected value is not realised, as indicated in our briefing, then the emphasis on the performance of those tracks will become even more severe.

We obviously have to evaluate the Indecon recommendations and put an implementation plan in place.  Our executive has been recognised by Indecon as being under-resourced, due to the numbers that were removed from the organisation in recent years because of cost-cutting measures.  Consequently, we do not have the facility to appoint a single individual with responsibility for risk and nor do we currently have the capacity to incur that additional resource.  Therefore, the risk officer role is deployed through a risk management committee.  That committee comprises the entire executive.  The risk management committee has completed a risk register with three different gradings of risk.  That risk register is then considered by the audit committee of the board and all high risks are considered at every single board meeting until they come down to an acceptable level.<\/p><p>  The solution we have proposed is robust.  It recognises the limitations of the resources we have available to us, but at the same time delivers a strong risk management policy.  From the recommendations in the Indecon report, the key was that we manage the risk and ensure that key personnel have responsibility for addressing the risk as it arises under those areas.  Ultimately, it is governed and controlled both by the audit committee in the first instance and by the board in total which has responsibility for it.  There are layers of risk governance within that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700012#L01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1417087800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I accept all that, but the line in the Indecon report is that at all times the board should ensure that an experienced risk officer and an effective internal audit function are in place.

I do not have the exact date when it was considered, but that report followed on from an examination conducted by Mr. Tim Dalton, former Secretary General of the then Department of Justice and Equality, of governance matters arising, I think, from the development of Shelbourne Park.  The report pointed out that there were difficulties with governance.  Some of the key findings included considerable day-to-day involvement by directors in the business of the organisation, including the provision of services; a failure to clearly outline the functions reserved to the board and those delegated to the executive until September 2002 when Bord na gCon formally adopted a code of corporate governance; a division of duties which served to limit the CEO's involvement in a key part of the organisation - Shelbourne Park and Harold's Cross - in the period from 1997 to 2003; a tendency for the chairman to adopt a hands-on approach and, at a later stage, ineffective communication between the board and the CEO and a failure to adequately involve the board in the planning and development of Shelbourne Park in 2005.  There is a history of difficulties in Bord na gCon around these developments and their governance and oversight.  What is disappointing is that in the period on which we have now reported these problems continued.  It could be that they were not adequately dealt with at the time and that adequate structures were not put in place.  There are resonances of these findings in the report now presented on the situation in Limerick.  That is part of the legacy with which the current board and executive are dealing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700013#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1417088400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Arising from that contributrion and previous questions, what Department, prior to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, was responsible for oversight of the operations of Bord na gCon?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700013#M00900","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417088400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>The then Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700013#M01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1417088400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Did officials from the relevant section of that Department transfer to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700013#M01100","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417088400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700013#M01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1417088400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Was there any conversation with them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700013#M01300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417088400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Yes; we received a briefing from them and had a number of meetings with them.

Then the organisation put in for planning for parking on the site that it did not own, only to be told by Limerick County Council that it would only allow for greyhound parking and that the vendor would be unable to use it for other activities.  The vendor wanted to appeal the case to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but Bord na gCon was against the idea because it would delay the project.  The vendor had Bord na gCon over a barrel.<\/p><p>  Then Bord na gCon had an issue or problem with the type of filling being carried out.  It appears that due to the absence of any proper form of planning Bord na gCon ended up spending &euro;4 million more than it should have spent, at a minimum.  A total of &euro;1.6 million was spent on the site being written off in Meelick, &euro;1.4 million went on costs incurred in respect of the site fill at Greenpark, something the vendor was supposed to do originally, and &euro;1 million was spent on a call option held by the vendor with Bord na gCon whereby the vendor could call upon Bord na gCon to purchase the freehold.  If proper preplanning had been carried out with Limerick County Council then, at a minimum, the organisation would have gone to the vendor and made the case that it would only buy the site if the vendor extended the site to include an area where Bord na gCon could get parking as well.<\/p><p>  It appears the board has a reserve function in terms of capital acquisitions.  Was the chief executive bypassing the board?  Was there proper reference back to the board?  Was it simply too loose?<\/p><p>  For me, it is simple.  Bord na gCon does great work in the dog and greyhound industry, which is of major importance.  The Greenpark racecourse is a fantastic amenity in the city.  I come from a county and I represent a portion of Clare where dogs are a major activity, but it is fair comment to say that fences were rushed and improper attention was paid in terms of due diligence prior to the purchase of the sites.

Ownership and dog pools are at the core of what drives business and income in stadiums.  The largest challenge - not just for the IGB, but all stakeholders and participants in the industry - is to increase the level of ownership and restore the dog pools.  Working with the stakeholders to achieve these aims is the challenge that we as an executive and the board face.  We have plans in place and in development to promote and develop ownership.  We will engage with stakeholders in the near future on how to progress the situation.  The level of ownership has decreased from approximately 17,000 in 2009 to approximately 8,000 currently.  One can see the impact of this on income lines in the stadia, for example, admission fees, food and beverage sales and expenditure on the Tote.  We must work through this critical issue with the people in the industry as well as with the organisation.  There is no magic road to recovery.  There is no quick six-month fix.<\/p><p>  We have been examining how to use our food and beverage model as a driver of attendance in the domestic market, for example, special offers and tailored packages on off nights.  We would use it as a means of encouraging people into stadia.  It would also be a driver in the corporate, incentive and tour operator markets.<\/p> <p>We have had some success in recent years in growing the tour operator business and the volumes through the stadiums from tour operators.  We are examining engaging with the tourism industry and international trade fairs to drive those numbers in the early part of 2015.  Food and beverage is a critical part of that plan and how it looks and what we offer will help to drive attendances in the stadium network.  <\/p><p> We are also examining having an increased sales resource and how we can do that effectively.  The sales resource we have currently is very limited and stretched in that the people who are in the sales function cover a multitude of other tasks on a day-to-day basis in the stadiums.  During the cost reduction phase staffing levels were reduced, therefore, the time available for selling and dealing with customers has been reduced.  We are currently concluding a test whereby we are using third party call centres to provide support for the local stadium managers in terms of their sales.  They do lead-generation work, business development and cold calling for us.  That is very cost effective rather than trying to put a team of sales people on the road.  We get an immediate response.  We get database building and profiling of potential customers, be they corporate or individual parties.  We will be running through an evaluation of that test programme in the coming weeks.  If that is proved successful in terms of the revenue generated from it, we will then seek to run a number of those campaigns by stadium during 2015.  It is a far more cost effective way rather than having sales people on the ground. <\/p><p> From a marketing strategy point of view, we are promoting the venues on the basis of a brand, a venue brand or entertainment brand within their local market.  Previously the main plank of the marketing strategy would have been promoting the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, but people do not travel to see the IGB.  They go to Curraheen Park, Shelbourne Park or Harold&rsquo;s Cross stadium.  We have individual websites and webpages and our digital strategy for 2015 will see the individual local brands in those areas.  Their websites will act as a hub for all social media activity and all digital activity and we will be able to engage with people, understand the profile of people coming through the gates, have better segmentation and be able to tailor and customise our activity and our offers towards people based on databases that have been and will be built during 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700019#S06600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417092600,"counter":590,"content":"<p>On that point, I am from Galway and with regard to the track there, do all these tracks have individual targets to meet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700020#T00200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417092600,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700020#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1417092600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>What happens if they do not meet them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112700020#T00400","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417092600,"counter":593,"content":"<p>The way we work is that each track has its own business plan and its own P&amp;L.

In October, the Minister for Finance wrote to the committee requesting that it look at a possible role for mortgage insurance in the Irish housing market and its impact on various stakeholders.  He asked the committee if it would consider the previous experience of mortgage insurance in Ireland, the models adopted and the experience of other jurisdictions.  Given the good work the committee has done on mortgage arrears and its concern that Ireland learns from past mistakes, it is appropriate and timely to examine innovations that may lead to greater stability in the banking sector and to greater protections for citizens.<br\/>We have invited a number of witnesses to discuss the issue of mortgage insurance.  This session will include submissions from some of those involved in the provision of MI  while the afternoon session will have a greater focus on consumer issues.  The format of the meeting will be a round table discussion.  I welcome the witnesses who will make their opening statements in the following order: Mr. Angel Mas, president and chief executive officer, and Mr. Simon Crone, vice president and commercial leader, Genworth Mortgage Insurance Europe; Mr. Joe Leddin, consultant, and Mr. Stephen Rance, JLT Insurance Brokers Limited; and Mr. Michael Bennett, chief actuary and chief risk officer and Mr. Florian Mayer, compliance officer, Arch Mortgage Insurance Ltd.

Genworth Financial is the only global leader in the provision of MI for residential mortgages with a market presence in 15 countries.  Our global reach across a range of jurisdictions and over a number of different housing cycles gives us a particular insight into how MI can operate under different conditions.  Genworth Financial has a substantial presence in Ireland.<\/p> <p>Last Monday, the Taoiseach opened our new international business centre in Shannon, where over 400 colleagues service Genworth's Irish and international operations.<\/p><p> We have provided MI to lenders for more than 70,000 borrowers in Ireland since early 2000.  We have first-hand experience of operating in Ireland.  The current focus on MI in Ireland directly arises from the recent consultation process with the Central Bank, which proposes to introduce certain caps for mortgages.  There is much in the Central Bank consultation with which we agree.  It is important that there is proper supervision on the granting of new mortgages, particularly for high loan to value, LTV, mortgages.  While the Central Bank proposals on LTV restrictions have been welcomed, there is concern that the proposed measures will have unintended consequences.  In particular, there is fear that new measures will deprive creditworthy purchasers of the capacity to buy their first home.  This could arise as a result of the inability of a purchaser to raise a 20% deposit, or as a consequence of the cap imposed on the number of high LTV mortgages that a bank can provide.  Once the 15% quota of mortgage allocations is used up, no more high LTV mortgages can be provided, regardless of the creditworthiness of the potential homeowner.  Given that high LTV represented approximately 50% of the mortgage market last year, a significant number of consumers will be excluded from the market and forced to wait an additional three to five years before becoming homeowners, if they are ever able to.  MI has an important role to play in facilitating prudent and sustainable regulation, while still facilitating home ownership for creditworthy first time buyers.<\/p><p> MI allows lenders to reduce the risk associated with high LTV mortgages by insuring the top tranche of the home loan.  For example, a lender who has an MI policy in place will be able to insure the first 15% to 20% of the value of a home being used as security of a loan.  The MI policy has various benefits for the system, lender and borrower.  It reduces the risk to the lender of providing a high LTV loan given that the top 15% value of the property is covered.  Given that the mortgage is covered by a credit risk mitigant, the lender has to put less capital against the high LTV loan.  Consequently, it is less expensive to provide the loan to the consumer.  The lender benefits because the loan application is scrutinised by a second pair of eyes.  The insurance company assesses the risk, and has an alignment of interest in the quality of it.<\/p><p> The lender and the insurer work together to ensure that borrowers are kept in their homes when they get into mortgage arrears.  The MI policy is not just about paying out when a house is repossessed and sold.  The MI provider works with the lender and the borrower to restructure loans that have gone into default with the objective of ensuring that the homeowner remains in his or her home.  This involves the insurer making payments to the lender to facilitate a restructure.  For example, in Ireland over the last five years we have worked with lenders to keep 15,000 families in their homes ahead of foreclosure and have paid over &euro;70 million to facilitate this happening, with a further &euro;40 million expected to be paid in the future.  MI also has significant benefits for consumers.  It enables people who would otherwise have been excluded from home ownership to access a family home with a reduced deposit.  It can also assist in reducing the cost of credit given the lower capital cost of a mortgage carrying MI.  There is the added comfort of knowing that in the event that the loan gets into difficulty there is a willing insurer prepared to work to keep the borrower and family in the home.<\/p><p> MI is nothing novel or new.  It is a well trusted international instrument that has been used successfully in a number of jurisdictions to facilitate prudent lending.  MI is used extensively in Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Mexico and the United States.  MI or mortgage indemnity bonds were also prevalent in Ireland as a matter of practice before the property boom.  Regrettably, as some lenders sought to encourage new business during the boom, they dispensed with the requirement for an indemnity bond to be in place and there was no regulatory compulsion for them to insist on one.  Caution and prudence suffered in a market that ran ahead of itself.  Had MI been prevalent in Ireland, it could have saved approximately &euro;1.7 billion of losses to Irish lending institutions.<\/p><p> I am conscious of the limited time.  I encourage the committee to recognise the positive and responsible contribution MI can make in Ireland.  There is plenty of international capacity for MI in a new, regulated landscape and the reinsurance market is also very alive and active internationally.  MI will facilitate responsible lending with proper mitigation of risk.  For the State and Central Bank, it can also work as a macro prudential tool to control systemic risk.  This is why we believe the new LTV limits and the 15% quota for high LTV lending proposed by the Central Bank should be flexible to accommodate creditworthy first-time buyers.  In such circumstances, it would be harsh to limit access to mortgages as a result of a quota.<\/p><p> It is important to define public policy around first-time buyers.  First-time buyers do not usually cause rapid home price appreciation.  Recent home price appreciation in Ireland has occurred mostly in above average upper market property and areas.  It did not require substantial credit availability, much less high LTV.  First-time buyers' products and the benefits associated cold be bound by age or property value to ensure they do not contribute to the most aggressive price increases.  Creditworthy first time buyers' access to credit should not be subject to quotas.  First time buyers require high LTV, low deposit loans, and, even when prudently originated, those loans represent a significant systemic risk, which can and should be mitigated with a specific and internationally tested and recognised solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angel Mas","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417082700,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us here.  I am here with my colleague, Mr. Stephen Rance, from our London office.  I work with JLT, which advises companies and governments on insurance matters across 135 countries.  Our expertise in the construction sector has led to our becoming the largest construction insurance broker in the world.  The Irish housing market is not functioning effectively.  As a company that advises globally, we believe the solution is relatively simple.  The key issue is risk and how it is regulated.  Nobody wants to return to the housing bubble.  The current mechanism for regulating risk in the market, particularly the proposed mechanism that most borrowers, unless privileged, would have to provide a 20% deposit, is too crude an instrument and would serve to exacerbate the problems already evident.  There is an alternative.  Rather than reducing risk by restricting first-time buyers' access to the market, one could insure against the risk.  The remedy is to introduce a mortgage indemnity guarantee scheme which would protect the banks against the risk of loss in the event of a fall in house prices.<\/p><p>  Most of the people who will address the committee today will suggest, as we do, that the solution is an insurance product.  The question is who should carry the cost.  Under the system we propose, there would be no cost to the State.  The bill would go to the banks, which would pay a once-off premium to insure against a fall in house prices of up to 30%.  Mortgage indemnity guarantees, MIGs, are being considered by the Central Bank, which, last month, suggested that people buying a house from a bank with a MIG in place could be exempt from the proposed 80% LTV restriction.  The Central Bank's principal concern is that such products be provided by highly-rated companies.  We agree, and would go further, suggesting all MIGs should be provided not by one company but by a pool of companies, all of which have an minimum credit rating of A.  The key point is that pooling reduces the risk even further.  Equally, such A rated plus insurers should be in a number of markets, not depending solely on mortgage risk.<\/p><p>  Under current proposals for dealing with the issue of mortgage risk, namely, the LTV restrictions, the banks would be fully liable for the first 80% of the value of the property.<\/p> <p>If MIGS were implemented as we are proposing this would see banks exposed only to the first 70% of the value of the property.  Aside from providing greater risk cover to the banks operating in the Irish market and doing away with the need for young house-buyers to come up with 20% deposits, MIGS would also provide a very valuable but very simple regulatory tool to the Central Bank.  By setting the level of MIGS in the market the Central Bank can effectively ease or restrict access to the housing market.  One could think of MIGS as being the Central Bank's thermostat.<\/p><p> In advance of addressing the committee today, JLT has held detailed discussions with the Construction Industry Federation, the banks and equity funds looking at the Irish market.  All are agreed that MIGS would act as a very effective stimulus to the new homes market.  In particular, the companies, including banks, which fund builders, have told us that the introduction of MIGS to the Irish market would greatly free up the availability of finance to Irish builders.  In every other country where MIGS were introduced, they have served to facilitate credit flow to builders.  I do not wish to prompt a detailed discussion about the banks' capital requirements but under BASEL rules the introduction of MIGS would relieve the capital requirements on Irish banks.<\/p><p> MIGS have already been considered by the Irish Central Bank would remove the need for first-time buyers to come up with onerous deposits.  They would significantly reduce the risk to banks operating in the Irish mortgage market; they would reduce the risk to the Irish economy of an overheating of the property market; they would give the Central Bank a very effective tool to restrict or promote access to the market place.  This would allow banks to pass on the savings to customers which come from reduced risk.  If 100% of the savings were passed on directly, we believe the average mortgage rate in the Irish market could fall by up to 2%.  MIGS would provide an immediate proven boost to builders, particularly those building for the new home and rental markets.

I will provide a brief introduction to Arch Capital, discuss the benefits of mortgage insurance and how the cost to consumers can be minimised. <\/p><p>  Arch Capital Group Limited, is a Bermuda public limited liability company with approximately $6.98 billion in capital at 30 September 2014.  Arch Capital is a NASDAQ listed company.  Through its operations in Bermuda, the United States, Europe and Canada, Arch Capital writes specialty lines of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance, as well as mortgage insurance and reinsurance, on a worldwide basis.  Arch Reinsurance Limited, the main insurance risk-bearing entity in Arch Capital has financial strength ratings of A1-, or outlook stable, from Moody&rsquo;s; A+, outlook stable, from A.M. Best Company; A+, outlook stable, from Standard &amp;amp; Poor&rsquo;s; and A+, outlook positive, from Fitch Ratings.<\/p><p>  In 2009, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Arch Capital began to recruit its mortgage insurance team.  The Arch mortgage insurance team has now more than 375 employees worldwide.  The Arch mortgage insurance team is dedicated to providing risk management and risk financing products to lenders worldwide, through its three distinct platforms in the United States, Europe and Bermuda.<\/p><p>  Our group of dedicated mortgage insurance and reinsurance professionals understands the unique requirements and challenges of mortgage insurance markets around the globe.  Our market-specific knowledge and expertise enables our teams to provide creative and commercially viable solutions for our clients.  Superior analytics and risk assessment, combined with outstanding client service, are at the forefront of all our activities. <\/p><p>  In 2013, Arch Capital developed and delivered the first insurance contract on the Freddie Mac agency credit insurance structure.  Freddie Mac is a US public Government-sponsored enterprise which seeks to reduce its risk exposure by obtaining insurance protection from private insurers.  In 2014, Arch Capital completed the acquisition of CMG MI, a US mortgage insurer which is the leading provider of mortgage insurance to the US credit union sector.<\/p><p>  Arch Capital established its presence in Ireland in 2008 and currently employs over 40 people through its subsidiary operations based at offices in Dublin and branches in Europe.  In 2011, Arch Mortgage Insurance Limited was established.  Arch Mortgage Insurance Limited is a mortgage insurer regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland and authorised to write mortgage insurance - non-life insurance class 14, credit insurance - in a number of EU member states on a freedom of services basis.  Arch Mortgage Insurance Limited has financial strength rating of A plus - outlook stable - from Standard &amp;amp; Poor&rsquo;s.<\/p><p>  Mortgage insurance increases the resilience of the banking sector to property shocks by providing additional capital to absorb losses from stressed economic scenarios.  The additional capital provided by mortgage insurers in respect of insured loans increases the aggregate stock of capital available to support mortgage lending.  Insurers who have a strong international presence and write multiple lines of insurance are well placed to absorb losses from mortgage exposure in one country.  The capital provided by international mortgage insurers has the benefit of being diversified from the capital base of the domestic banking sector.  Mortgage insurance, through increasing the resilience of the banking sector to property shocks, reduces the potential need for future taxpayer support to the banking sector.  Mortgage insurance may help improve loan underwriting quality as the mortgage insurer will provide feedback to the banking sector in terms of changes to underwriting standards and practices.  The mortgage insurer effectively acts as a second pair of eyes. <\/p><p>  The recent UK Treasury help-to-buy guarantee scheme for high loan-to-value mortgages achieved good take-up by lenders due to the approval by the UK regulator of the capital benefits to lenders who participated in the scheme.  Lenders who participated in the guarantee scheme can hold less capital in respect of the guaranteed loans due to the fact that additional capital is being held by the guarantee scheme in respect of the covered loans.  In Italy, the regulator gives preferential capital treatment to loans above 80% loan-to-value, LTV, where the loan is covered by mortgage insurance.<\/p><p>  We encourage the Central Bank to provide clear guidance to lenders on the reduction in the capital they are required to hold when a loan is insured by a strongly capitalised and highly rated mortgage insurer.  We note that the EU capital requirements regulations, CRR Article 202, in respect of eligible providers of unfunded credit protection require an equivalent rating of A- or above. <\/p><p>  The cost of mortgage insurance is comprised of three components: the expected losses; the cost of capital which the insurer holds in respect of the insured risk; and the administrative costs of providing the insurance services, such as loan audits and claims handling.  The larger of these components are the expected losses and the cost of capital, with the administrative costs being the smallest component. <\/p><p>  Where mortgage insurance is provided in a regulatory framework which allows for capital benefits to lenders, the economic benefits of reduced losses for the lender and lower cost of capital for the lender balance off against the cost of these components in the mortgage insurance premium.  The net economic cost of providing mortgage insurance is the frictional administrative cost of providing the insurance services.  However, there are also additional benefits to the lender in terms of increased resilience to withstand adverse economic scenarios and lower volatility in the lender&rsquo;s profitability.  These benefits may enable the lender to access funding and capital from the capital markets more easily and cheaply than they would have done so in the absence of mortgage insurance. <\/p><p>  We believe that the cost of mortgage insurance would not be fully passed through to the consumer, but rather lenders would adjust their pricing of mortgage interest rates to allow for the economic benefits of mortgage insurance to the lender.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Bennett"},{"type":"speech","time":1417083300,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I will now outline the rules of the meeting in order to give everyone an opportunity to ask questions.

In a typical example on a &euro;200,000 mortgage in Ireland a single upfront cost, a one-off payment from the bank would be somewhere in the order of &euro;2,000.  If that was transferred to the borrower in full as part of the interest rate that is charged on the mortgage it would end up being around &euro;250 a year.  The bank would obtain many potential benefits, in terms of reducing its capital and provisionings and therefore the full cost may not need to be passed on to the consumer.  In the worst case it is &euro;250 a year.

How much uptake is there for this type of product in, say, other European countries?  For those who do take up the product, how many times is it called upon?  In the Irish context, we already have banks with buckets of insurance policies against risk, so this will be an extra layer of risk insurance for the bank against a borrower, who might not be as sure as we have been at the bank, which says much more about our banks' practices in the past than it does about borrowers at the moment.  We are actually potentially proposing to penalise borrowers more than we have done in the past with hidden costs through the interest rate charges from banks already, because our current banks cannot borrow on the capital market.  The reason this insurance is needed - and it is needed - is that our banks cannot borrow on the capital markets.  It should never be the case that the borrower pays.  I appreciate that it costs &euro;2,000 for a &euro;200,000 mortgage, but the lender should pay, as it is the lender that will benefit from this.  The customer will still pay their mortgage at the interest rates that are set by the banks at the moment.

There is now a soft cap, which is what we would propose here, so that banks can give up to 80% LTV loans.

Fundamentally the banks see it as a problem of risk and risk is associated with reserves and capital.  Banks perceive that high LTV loans have specific risk characteristics.  This is not due to the low quality of the loan, which must be of high quality, as we cannot do sub-prime high loan-to-value, no question about it.  Even when a good quality loan originates from the high loan-to-value segment, if it goes on default the loss for the bank will be much bigger.  In view of that, the banks must have bigger reserves and much more capital - sometimes six times as much capital.  That is why the cost of high LTV loans is much greater.  Such loans are directly associated with first-time buyers, which is why first-time buyers are the first to suffer when there is a solvency or capital problem in the bank.  There is no credit access to them, so we are trying to propose a way of reconciling those two elements: prudent access to credit for first-time buyers and macro prudence and financial stability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700007#F01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angel Mas"},{"type":"speech","time":1417084500,"counter":711,"content":"<p>In the markets in which the witnesses' firms are currently operating, how much of a draw is there on the insurance policies that have been sold?

They must be specialists and really know what they are doing.  Generalists are not appropriate.

I must say I am somewhat sceptical about all of this.  Our mortgage market is picking itself up off the floor and all of a sudden we have various companies coming in and dressing this up as something to help individual mortgage holders.  It is not that long ago since we were in this room dealing with people who had been mis-sold mortgage protection insurance.  The banks and their agents had to be forced, in a David versus Goliath-like fashion, to repay mortgage holders.  There was a cohort of people in financial difficulty who, on checking the small print, found that they did not qualify.  I am sorry if I am somewhat sceptical about the intent here.  I am dubious about the claim that this is something that is good for the mortgage holder.  Certainly, risk sharing is something that this committee is interested in and in that regard, there is a role for insurance companies.  However, I do not believe that this will ultimately be a lender-paid product.  In other words, I do not believe that the banks will pay the insurance companies and the consumer or mortgage holder will have a safety net available should he or she run into financial difficulties.  That is just not the way it works.  Banks are in business to make a profit, as are the insurance companies.  While I am all for profit, the notion that this is a lender-paid product does not stack up.<\/p><p>  I ask the witnesses to give their views on the lending institutions only having recourse to 80% of mortgages taken out by first-time buyers, with the 20% non-recourse element being the subject of a separate financial insurance contract between insurance companies and the banks.  If, for example, a first-time buyer runs into difficulty with a mortgage for a family home, he or she is on the hook for 80% and the bank cannot pursue the mortgage holder for 100% of the liability.  The mortgage insurance requirement would be on the non-recourse element based on a strict contractual arrangement between the lenders and the insurance providers.  The historical experience of mortgage insurance here is not a pretty picture.  There are thousands of people in this country who would have a very jaundiced view of what they are hearing this morning.  The insurers are being portrayed here as knights in shining armour coming to the rescue of an emerging market that is only just picking itself up off the floor and offering something that is good for the mortgage holder, the insurance companies and the banks.  However, it would only be good for mortgage holders if they were not on the hook for 100% of their liability, on the back of an arrangement between the banks and the insurance companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700010#J01400","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417086300,"counter":782,"content":"<p>The proposal made by the Deputy is that the portion of the loan above 80% would be unsecured lending and would be non-recourse and he asks whether there would be an appetite among insurers to insure such a loan.  The first step would be to fundamentally change the way mortgages and credit are distributed in Ireland and to tier mortgages into two components, a secured and an unsecured component.  That would need to be evaluated in detail to determine its impact.  The second aspect to this is the appetite of insurers to lend in those circumstances.  We would term that a \"second lien\" although it is not even that; it is an unsecured second lien which sits over the first security that the bank has towards the borrower.

We believe that mortgage insurance would facilitate a more open market and assist people who have good jobs and strong affordability but who may not be able to save up the large deposit required.  We believe it would create a fairer market for all first-time buyers.  I agree with the Deputy that it absolutely should be a lender-paid product.<\/p><p>  Mortgage indemnity insurance is not the same as mortgage payment protection insurance.

Mortgage insurance would be a contractual relationship between the lender and the insurer and the loan agreement is a contractual relationship between the lender and the borrower.  To the extent that there are disclosures of information in respect of costs and illustrations one might see in other insurance products, that would be an issue for the regulator.  I do not think we as an insurer who is now a party to the agreement could dictate it.<\/p><p>  In respect of due diligence, most insurers operate under a delegated underwriting authority but perform periodic evaluations and loan file audits to assess underwriting criteria, including the accuracy of appraisal values.  My experience is that for high LTV lending, a full appraisal whereby an appraiser visits the property, rather than a drive by appraisal or a view of comparable properties on a website, would be the most appropriate.  We would be happy to provide coverage to State banks.  In terms of the pricing and whether it varies by loan attributes, it does not vary by health and that is not a criterion this is considered by even the lenders.  They consider the sustainability of income and affordability.  In terms of age, the only caveat I would add is that the borrower must be have sufficient income for the term of the mortgage.  Therefore, there is usually is a limitation on lending into retirement but there is not a differentiation between someone who is aged 35 and someone who is aged 40, apart from their being able to sustain the mortgage for its term. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700015#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Bennett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417088700,"counter":834,"content":"<p>I will respond to Deputy Barry's point on first-time buyers and the impact a cap would have and my colleagues can respond to some of the other points he raised.  There will be a little fewer than 10,000 first-time buyer mortgages in Ireland this year, which will be  high loan to value which is typical for first-time buyers.  At the peak of the market there were more or less 37,000.  If the normal level could be half the number at the peak, and  I am speculating on this, let us say it would be 20,000 mortgages, that would mean that if it is 50% in terms of  first-time buyers, it would be 40,000 total mortgages.  If a cap of 15% is imposed, 14,000 families would be excluded from home ownership because they would not have the high loan to value mortgage they require. Even if applied to today's levels, that would mean that 6,000 of the mortgages that were originated this year would have been part of the quota and 4,000 would have been excluded and this is at a time when we have an all time low.  Clearly, there is a need for a solution and we think mortgage insurance is a key part of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700015#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angel Mas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417088700,"counter":835,"content":"<p>To respond to Deputy Barry's second question, he is correct that &euro;20,000 would be maximum claim amount in the example he gave and his understanding on that is correct.  We are supportive of transparency.  There is nothing to hide in what we are trying to promote.  For example, in Finland the cost of the mortgage insurance is laid out and the borrower sees it transparently and it can also be capitalised into the loan and can get spread over a cost rather the borrower having to come up with, say, &euro;2,000 in the example I mentioned.  We would support such transparency.  As Mr. Bennett mentioned, we do due diligence up front and then we do ongoing due diligence to make sure that the quality of underwriting prudencies continued to be applied and that the valuation standards are high.<\/p><p>  On regional caps, we would support something like that.  The house prices required for first time buyers in Dublin with the commensurate affordability and prudency that is applied is different from perhaps other parts of the country and so a different level may be suitable for different parts of the country.  We agree that we would work with both State and privately owned organisations and we would not treat them any differently.

The key point I want to make is that the main beneficiary of restrictions on reckless borrowing and lending will be the borrowers themselves.  The people who suffer most when they borrow too much are borrowers.  The banks can be insured and bailed out but the borrowers are the major losers.  It is a decision of the Central Bank but as a society we need to set a level for prudent borrowing.  Whether the LTV is 80% or 90%, we should set it and not exceed it.  If we think that 80% is the correct level for prudent lending, we should not then allow reckless borrowing by way of mortgage indemnity insurance.  That is very important.<\/p><p>  If we think that 80% is too low, and it may well be, we should consider having an appropriate LTV, which might be 90%.  We should not use mortgage indemnity insurance to get around prudent borrowing and lending.  I do not think mortgage indemnity insurance is a very good idea.  There was a very good discussion today, during which other witnesses made presentations.  One point that is missed is that the insurance is very expensive and is paid by the borrower.  It may be paid directly in the form of money seen in a mortgage statement or paid in some other way through interest rates, but borrowers will end up footing the bill for mortgage insurance.  There are not many benefits for the borrower.  If the mortgage defaults, the lender may well receive a lump of money from the insurance company, but the borrower is still on the hook for it, which is a very important point.  <\/p><p>  An example was given today of a house worth &euro;200,000 with a LTV of 90% where the extra 10% was insured for a premium of &euro;2,000.  It is important to realise only 10%, or &euro;20,000, of the mortgage is being insured for a premium of &euro;10,000.  It is not as if the whole mortgage or the bank's loss will be repaid if the borrower defaults.  It is a very limited loss.  I was very surprised to hear Genworth Financial say today that it paid out 15,000 claims and a total of &euro;70 million.  That sounds like a lot of money and I was surprised by the figure.  In fact, it is &euro;7,000 per claim.  It will not make a large dent if there is another major problem.  <\/p><p>  The problem we have is how first time buyers can enter the housing market.  They cannot come up with a deposit of 20%.  My suggestion is to allow them to access their pension funds for the deposit.  At the current time when somebody retires at the age of 65 years, he or she can access 25% of his or her pension fund tax free.  I suggest we allow people to access it early, when they need it.  That would mean people would be able to save a 20% deposit and there would be lower LTVs, interest rates and overall payments, which would be good for everybody.  It would not be good for the insurance companies because they would not get their premiums, but it would be very good for borrowers and the economy.  <\/p><p>  Whatever changes we make should be introduced gradually.  Deputy Pearse Doherty pointed out yesterday that we cannot introduce an 80% LTV on 1 January if mortgage insurance is not in place.  If the Central Bank decides to bring in 80% LTV, it should be phased in over a period of time.  Any changes should be phased in rather than introduced on 1 January because there will be unintended consequences.

I do not want to repeat some of the things Mr. Burgess said.  A number of our comments will be in a similar vein.  The invitation asked us to address previous experience of mortgage insurance in Ireland.  I do not think there is significant experience from a consumer perspective of mortgage insurance schemes, but we have experience of mortgage protection insurance, which is mandatory under consumer credit legislation and it is the lender which must ensure that life protection is in place.<br\/>In a number of instances of which we are aware, those policies have lapsed due to people falling into arrears, as have buildings and house contents insurance on existing mortgages.  The consequences of that for borrowers are important to understand.  During the boom years a number of people took out optional insurance policies such as critical illness cover, redundancy insurance and so on.  Members will be aware of the difficulties that have occurred with some of those policies in terms of people understanding the restrictions on the policies with which they have become involved.  There are a number of associated costs with servicing a mortgage, quite apart from the monthly instalment.  That is relevant to the question of mortgage insurance in particular because, as Mr. Burgess said, although the policy is taken out in the lender's name, in effect the cost of the premium is bourne by the borrower, one way or another.<br\/>We understand that the reason the committee is considering this issue is in the context of the Central Bank's consultation paper on a macro prudential policy for residential mortgage lending.  There has been a lot of concern about the 20% deposit in terms of the LTV ratio.  As Mr. Burgess said, the mortgage insurance scheme can be used to mitigate that 20% rule by the lender taking out a policy to cover 10% of it.  In theory, it would appear that everybody would benefit from this, in the sense that a borrower with a good credit history would not have to build up such a large deposit and the lender is covered for a portion of the loan in the event of some cyclical swing in property values and so on.  There is the ongoing effect of boosting the construction industry on the face of it.<br\/>The example of Canada is often cited and Genworth Financial, which was before the committee today, had an involvement in the Canadian market.  In our submission we included a couple of comments.  One is from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, CMHC, and explains the product on its website.  It states: <blockquote>To obtain CMHC Mortgage Loan Insurance, lenders pay an insurance premium.  Typically, your lender will pass these costs on to you.  Your lender will give you the exact price when you apply for a mortgage.  The CMHC Mortgage Loan Insurance premium is calculated as a percentage of the loan and is based on the size of your down payment.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>The economist, Jim Power, published a paper recently in conjunction with the Genworth financial breakfast where the virtues of mortgage insurance schemes were extolled, and it was suggested that mortgage insurance should be left to the private sector through a mortgage insurance model rather than be backed by the State.  In the absence of a State-backed scheme, it is clear that the cost of such a scheme would reflect on the borrower's capacity to pay.  In the context of the Central Bank's consultation paper that this has an effect on the loan-to-income, LTI, debt-to-income, DTI, and debt-servicing-to-income, DSTI, aspects of the paper, it recommended a 3.5 times loan-to-income ratio.  The bank is suggesting that this equates to a maximum of 40% of take-home pay being paid on accommodation costs.  We already think that is quite high.  The international standard would generally tend to be one third.  However, when one adds in insurance - life cover and optional insurance - and if the borrower also has to pay for mortgage insurance for the lender, then the affordability problem becomes more apparent.<br\/>The question is who benefits from the mitigation of the risk.  One of the purposes of the insurance is to compensate the lender, or investor who has bought a package of mortgages, where the borrower becomes unable to make full payments.  I understand from Canada that in these instances the property is often repossessed.  An issue for the committee to consider is whether the introduction of such a scheme would prevent house repossessions in the event of default.<br\/>The concluding part of the submission contains a quote from a recent article we saw in a Canadian business journal, <i>The Globe and Mail<\/i>.  It is an interesting article because it references the announcement by the Government of the 75 action points to kick-start and reinvigorate the construction industry.  Interestingly, the title of the article is &quot;Canada should learn from Ireland&rsquo;s housing crash&quot;.  It explains that the bank is required to buy the insurance in Canada but it makes the home buyer pay the premiums.  The insurance pays the bank back if the home buyer defaults.  The buyer loses their house, while the bank recoups everything that was owed on the mortgage.  I take it this is a reputable journal.  The article says that the insurance therefore encourages banks to lend bigger and riskier mortgages than they otherwise would..  According to the author of the article, the scheme seems to have had an effect on house prices in Canada.  The author concludes the article by saying that Canada might benefit from some of the lessons that Ireland has learned the hard way.  She says, these include &quot;the dangers that stem from a lack of adequate data to study the housing market, the dangers of promoting the idea that home ownership is almost always preferable to renting, the dangers of relying on construction for economic growth and, importantly, the dangers of assuring people that a soft landing is on the horizon&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700016#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417089900,"counter":848,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Joyce.

My actual role is described by the Central Bank for English speakers as the pre-approved controlled function.  That means I work mainly in compliance, which sets out the rules of how the financial system works and the ways one should and should not behave.  I would like to think that it gives me some insight into this subject.<\/p><p>  Our main job in residential lending, which is to help families to buy homes, and by and large that is what we do.  We have done it successfully for more than a decade.  When I hear people talk about issues and the impact on first-time buyers, it concerns me.  We are the ones who face these people and we know their issues.  We see how hard it is to save for a house at a time when one might have children, when the banks underwrite against people who have children, and when there is higher taxation.  Those are all things that make it difficult.  It does not help the people who are impacted by it to make it more difficult in order to get some approved ideological outcome.  Yesterday, I heard that only 2,800 first-time buyers will be affected by the proposed changes.  That is not an accurate reflection of the gross number because if one looks at the number of people borrowing, people in negative equity can be affected by this.  There is an exemption in it for people with negative equity but not on the new loan, so they will be in there.  People who remortgage, who might want to do up their house, will be competing for the same limited number of higher loan-to-value loans.  To say only 2,800 people will be affected is taking the minimal data figure one can get away with and still be telling the truth, and inferring that is the size of the problem when it is not.<\/p><p>  I also do not know whether it is the role of regulation to create a market for a private insurer.  That does not sit well with me.  I do not say that not having mortgage insurance is good but equally, to open the doors for firms to come in means there is a layer of cost attached.  Insurance is not altruism and it never was.  It will come at a cost.  When we talk about preventing people from hurting themselves, I still refuse to believe that the majority of people are too thick to make good decisions.  Generally, what has happened is people have been hit with job losses, rising taxation and increased costs, which caused compression.  A lot of mortgages are quite sustainable as people are on trackers, and even they are going into arrears.  Unemployment does not explain that because in 80% of households with arrears there is no unemployed adult, which means there are other forces at play.  Going into this crisis we did not have things like the Insolvency Service of Ireland that could deal with secured debt.  Neither did we have a reformed bankruptcy process.  We have that now, so if we are going to try to future-proof things, it does not mean one has to do it in credit, because we do not have a credit bubble - what we have is a housing shortage.  The vacancies in Dublin City Council at the moment are the lowest they have been since it first kept statistics.  It is just under 1.5%.  The last time we had this few houses available was in the early 1800s.  That is where one is seeing it on the social housing side.  When one does not have enough houses to apply a macro tool on credit, when lending is at about one tenth of what it was at the peak and when the volumes are back where they were in the early 1970s, what is proposed is the wrong medicine for the job.  That is the fact of the matter.  It is also not going to prevent a boom and bust scenario.  There are several reasons for that.<\/p><p>  I have been involved in a project - Ronan Lyons is working on a similar one - looking at house prices going back over time.  We had boom and bust scenarios in the 1700s when there was not a mortgage market and likewise in the 1800s.  Normally, an under-investment in housing causes compression and causes prices to rise.  In the past that helped to create tenements because people piled into the same existing stock.  I hope we can avoid that.  One of the nice things about modern society is that we should have better tools to get ahead, but that is the kind of outcome that has been there.  When one looks at Hong Kong, which has been in such a situation since 1991, there have been two spectacular boom and bust cycles in the same period.  Canadian house prices have gone out of kilter.  In Sweden house prices are spiralling out of control even though a cap on loan-to-value has been introduced.  People are actually taking risky loans to get around it.<\/p><p>  We should probably not be having this conversation.  The Central Bank plan should not go ahead and neither should the plans for mortgage indemnity.  I have worked in this area for a long time and the lending we are doing now is very responsible and prudent.  One could do things that already exist in legislation such as increase the stress tests that go on loans when they are stressed to see what would happen if rates change.  If one increased that, one would probably make it safer, without any of what has been proposed.  If one wants to introduce insurance, then let it be for the things that hurt people such as job loss.  One solutions would be if everyone who took out a mortgage had to pay a certain small amount of the mortgage repayment, whether the loan is performing or not, towards a fund that would help cover a mortgage for a period should one lose one's job, and that was triggered when one went into the mortgage arrears resolution process.  Such a scheme, which could be easily set up and run by the State, the banks or whoever, would save a lot more people than this scheme.  When repossession triggers the pay-out, then that means we will have to repossess houses a lot.  We do not want that.  The Central Bank brought out rules which included a ban on repossessions, which was a failed concept brought in from Hungary, and then the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which is seen internationally as one of the worst pieces of financial regulation not only in Europe or among OECD countries, but in the  world.  That is what we are up against.  Repossession will not work.<\/p> <p> Equally, institutions like Genworth were highly in favour of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears because it would prevent it having to pay out.  There will always be times of booms and bust.  Homeownership creates wealth in households.  It is one of the biggest forms of wealth in the world.  For people who start off with nothing and succeed in owning their own home, the generation following them tends to do better.  That is the empirical evidence.  To lock people out from owing their own home, which is what this proposal will do, is to deny them a better financial future.  <\/p><p> We are also not making very good comparisons.  Much of what is being spoken about is being spoken about in isolation and is not well placed to be looked at here.  In Canada, the main provider is the Canadian Home and Mortgage Corporation, which is a state-backed body that has an implicit state guarantee.  We are talking not about doing that but about bringing in insurance firms from mainland Europe to do this.  That is not to suggest that the Canadian system is better but structurally it is quite different.<\/p><p> On rising house prices and what is proposed, a worse correlation between the two could not be made.  They are two distinctly different issues.  What is proposed will not solve or fix anything.  I created a financial calculator to examine what would be the impact of what is proposed on borrowers.  Even if prices rose by about one third of what the ESRI predicts, the cost of staying out of the market and meeting the cost of rising rents while continuing to save to get together a large deposit is a brand of austerity which most households could not endure.  Those who did so would still be &euro;100,000 worse off at the end of the day.  Again, the role of regulation is not to make the citizens of a country poor.  Having said that, I do not know if there is an ideal answer.  What I do know is that this idea is wrong.  I know this because I have been working in this area for a long time.  In the past, we had mortgage indemnity guarantees, the cost of which was always passed on.  These were later done away with.  I think KBC was the last to stop doing them in 2004.  As loans get older they tend to become safer.  In this instance, there will not even be an opportunity for loans to get older because they are not sufficient houses to buy, which is the reason approvals are increasing but draw-downs are not.  We should be focusing on housing people who cannot afford to house themselves and on building houses for people who can afford to buy them.  If we focused on that and did it well this whole conversation would be seen for the misplaced concept that it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700017#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Karl Deeter","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417090500,"counter":851,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.  I am not sure I have much to add apropos of the previous speakers.  I believe what the Central Bank is doing is important because at this time, long before any credit bubble arises, it is seeking to, and properly so, ensure that we do not, if possible, repeat the mistakes of the past.  The Central Bank's function is to, in so far as is possible, maintain price stability.  While inflation rates are currently low the real cost of living is inflating by reason, primarily, of increased property prices, be that in the rental or purchase markets.  The Central Bank has a duty to ensure that as far as is possible we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.  The question then is how does it do this.  One mechanism is to require a deposit.  It is in that context that the discussion around the mortgage insurance schemes arises.  In my view, the requirement in terms of that deposit will be an important decision made by the Central Bank.  It is designed not to punish first time buyers, even though it will have an affect on them, rather it is fundamentally to avoid banks becoming involved in what Mr. Burgess described as reckless lending or in improvident lending.  The idea that the banks will not do that again is entirely misplaced.  The banks will do that again once they get an opportunity to do so.  Unless there is regulation against this, eventually time will pass and we will all forget what happened in 2007-2008, property prices will continue to increase, developers will recommence developing, credit will return to the market and, as prices increase, there will be a feeling of nothing can go wrong this time and we return to a credit bubble.  This will happen unless steps are taken to ensure it does not happen.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that while in Ireland when it comes to housing we live very much of the law of the jungle, in other countries, the state is involved in the property market.  Here the only involvement of the State in the property market is in terms of social housing provision.  In terms of the mortgage market for buyers with a rental market this is very much an unregulated environment.  Regulation needs to be introduced in that area.  In the 1970s when my parents were buying a house banks did not provide mortgages for first time buyers.  These mortgages were provided by building societies or mutuals which were effectively not-for-profit organisations.  The current providers of finance for the purchase of properties are profit driven organisations who make their profits from lending.  It must be recognised, even at this early stage, that unless the market is regulated and unless credit is restricted we will inevitably fall back into a credit driven bubble.  It is this that the Central Bank is seeking to guard against.  The question that arises is what affect would the mortgage insurance schemes have on that regulation.  My concern is that they are an attempt to avoid regulation.  The pretence is that if they are put in place there will be no need for a 15% or 20% deposit.  Eventually what will happen is that the deposit required will decrease and be replaced with insurance, which is okay for the banks, but will result in more lending into the market thus driving prices up.  The argument against this - this was raised yesterday at this committee - is that it creates an inequality between those who can borrow and therefore have homeownership and those who cannot because they cannot get together the 20% deposit.  The Governor made the point that credit does not result in greater equality.  He cited the example of the United States where credit has resulted in deeper inequality.  The Governor is correct that access to credit does not result in greater equality.<\/p><p>  In all of that context, I believe the mortgage insurance schemes, while may be of some benefit, cannot be used to set at nought or undo the proper regulation that the Central Bank is seeking to put in place to limit the amount of credit into the area of homeownership, which is not good for the banks because they want to do that because that is where they will make profit, but it is good for society.  At the same time, that will not solve all of our problems.  We need also to look at other ways in which people can have sustainable long term stable housing.  That, I respectfully submit, involves the state.  The cost for a family with three children living in Dublin today renting or meeting mortgage payments on a three bed semi-detached house at the bottom rather than top end of the market is, at a minimum, &euro;1,500 per month.  If that is the case, then applying the Insolvency Service of Ireland reasonable living standard, that family would require a gross income of in excess of &euro;70,000 per annum.  This is an indication that the cost of living, when rent-mortgage costs in Ireland today are factored in, is a problem.  As pointed out by Mr. Deeter, supply will be important in addressing that.  <\/p><p>  I would be concerned that a scheme like this would create a gap in the hedge to allow banks avoid regulation, which is important, resulting in five years' time in crazy lending happening again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700018#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ross Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1417090500,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I now invite Dr. Ronan Lyons, economist, Trinity College Dublin, to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700018#S00300","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417090500,"counter":853,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.<\/p> <p>I also apologise if I duplicate some of the points already made.  I will keep it brief.<br\/>I hope most of us agree on what high level housing policy should be, which is that families should have access to affordable and abundant good-quality homes, and, if I can cheekily say, everything else is just detail.  Obviously getting the details right matters.  The State should be neutral between private profit-making, private co-operatives and social.  It should also be neutral between owning and renting.  These are not for the State to decide.  We need to think of three groups, namely, private owners, private renters and social renters.  I will return to this point because it is where the mortgage insurance scheme is targeted.<br\/>Affordability is about linking incomes to prices or rents and the cost of building.  This can be thought of as a competitiveness argument  The State tries to attract companies such as Google.  The bulk of the cost base of such a company is wages, and the bulk of wage demands is to do with housing.  In Trinity, students come from abroad and state they cannot find somewhere to live or it is too expensive.  This affects competitiveness.  The simplest maths is that we have a growing population but not a growing housing stock.  It is a human right to have shelter.  We can already see in the rental market that we have greater sprawl because we have reached the limit of where rents can go, and now a greater number of buses come from Cavan, Laois and Wexford on a daily basis bringing students to Dublin.  The reasons for this sprawl may be for another committee, but it is not a sustainable long-term policy.<br\/>I will now discuss the housing market specifically in terms of the mortgage market.  There are two sets of factors.  The first of these comprises incomes, supply and demographics, and these affect prices and rents.  Another set of factors affects the relationship between the two, which comes down to expectations and credit.  There is much more detail in the housing market, but it comes down to these issues.<br\/>Mr. Maguire mentioned credit rationing.  The effect of this is to try to keep the link between house prices and incomes, which should have a stable relationship. Credit rationing also aims to keep prices in line with rents.  The side effect of credit rationing is to prevent the cost of building a home from getting out of control.  In a sense we are too late on this, because it is what happened in the decade to 2007 and 2008, when the cost of building a home got way out of line with peoples' incomes and, because the price was going up, nobody really cared that much about the cost.  There was free profit because credit was so easy.<br\/>The supply of credit should be rationed and the supply of housing is key.  The effect of new supply is to keep prices and rents down; sometimes it is tough think in these terms given what we know and what happened over the past 15 years.  One can say there was much new supply between 2001 and 2007, but neither income nor supply had an impact on prices in these years.  The only thing that drove up prices was credit.  We are now seeing the impact on prices and rents of all of the excess building in terms of keeping prices and rents low.<br\/>There was very little building in the greater Dublin area on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis, even during the bubble.  My concern is the new regulations have caked in the high cost base, which means that new housing is anti-poor in that those on low average incomes cannot afford to buy a minimum spec home in the greater Dublin area because of local authority regulations.  Ironically, the new regulations mean greater profits per unit in euro terms for those who do get to build.  The problem is most do not get to build because the numbers do not stack up.<br\/>How does all this relate to mortgage insurance?  The direct effect of mortgage insurance will be to increase prices relative to rents and incomes.  This is not in debate.  If one gives more people more credit the first and most important thing to happen will be that prices will increase relative to rent and income.  Generally speaking this is a bad thing unless it is in some way sustainable.  An insurance scheme may remove some of the risk to the banks, but it breaks the link between peoples' incomes and the cost of people's homes.  This is my concern.  We can go into it in more detail during the discussion.<br\/>Generally speaking, I hope committee members have taken from what I have said that as a general rule credit rationing is good and what the Central Bank is trying to do is good.  Clearly there are transitional issues and cost issues with regard to building a home.  The introduction of mortgage insurance would undo this work and would leave us open to the prospect of another bubble.  The one asterisk to this is if we have next to no social housing strategy then mortgage insurance might fulfil a role.  If one thinks about the distribution of people and, for simplicity, renting as an age factor, there will be a dividing line between people at family stage in the private and social sectors and the minimum deposit will determine the boundary.  No social housing would mean the lowest minimum deposit possible because the private sector would have to provide for everyone and therefore everyone would require access to credit.  The existence of a social housing strategy would mean such a low minimum deposit would not be necessary and the deposit could be much higher and safer.  The concern is the mortgage insurance scheme is effectively a substitute for a full social housing scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700018#S00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Lyons","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417091100,"counter":855,"content":"<p>I must go to the Seanad soon so I will probably have to leave before the witnesses conclude their replies.

It is not just about the money.  It is about how the money is used and how the rents are paid.  As I understand it, a normal social housing system works along two principles.  The first is that one borrows money to build social housing and that gets paid back over a 30-year period.  I think we are drifting back into that but for too long, it was capital grants-based where it was a case of \"once you have it, you have it and when you don't, you don't\".  This is definitely not counter-cyclical, which is what one needs for social housing.  The second element concerns the rent a social housing tenant pays.  To put it bluntly, at the moment, they are paying such a small fraction that the cost then falls on the taxpayer who has limited appetite for that.  Under a system that is much more commonly used in the rest of Europe, a fraction of a person's income up to a maximum goes on the rent and the taxpayer pays the rest.  This then prevents any perverse incentives around not wanting to get a higher paying job or to get out of a certain income threshold.<\/p><p>  Do we have a social housing strategy?  There was one launched yesterday but I do not know if it is called a strategy.  Is it where we need to be in ten years time?  I think it is still well short of that.  It is still far more a private rather than a social sector and this affects many families.  We have a very limited social sector compared to other countries in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700020#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Lyons"},{"type":"speech","time":1417091700,"counter":865,"content":"<p>A point that was raised by Mr. Deeter and possibly by others was the issue of repossession triggering the payment of insurance and the possibility that this would increase repossessions or drive a need for repossessions.

If they have a way of keeping the person <i>in situ <\/i>so it remains the bank's problem, there might be a weird set of incentives.<br\/>If we are talking about pensions and access to them, at a time of increased longevity where people are not saving enough already, giving them money from their future pot that will keep them going could be a mistake.  By definition, a mortgage or at least credit involves moving money through time so one is reaching into one's future.  Let us suppose prices stay the same.  If one bought a house for &euro;100,000 and after ten years, one owed &euro;90,000, that &euro;10,000 difference constitutes one's wealth.  Mortgages in a way are like forced savings and are quite beneficial in that respect.  When people get to an older age and they are mortgage-free, it helps them to take on the income shock that retirement represents.<br\/>It is important to realise that being able to access that credit is important and it is important in terms of household wealth.  We are probably not the people who will be affected by this.  We include a professor, someone involved in a finance, a lawyer, a barrister and another accountant.  We are all successful people.  The people I see who are discriminated against financially work in real, regular jobs and the banks are already starting to look down their noses at them.  Any move in this area will have many bad outcomes.  As I said, a person's household wealth at retirement is mainly made up in the world of home ownership, regardless of whether it is ideal or not.  That is a fact.  Home ownership should not be discouraged by stopping people from getting credit because most of the loans are working out.  Most homes do not get repossessed and the majority of them do not go into arrears.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700020#U00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Karl Deeter"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417091700,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I will follow on from the point made by Mr. Burgess and Mr. Deeter about dipping into pensions  One can flip it around and say that the transition is important but if we leave it aside and think about somebody in their early twenties now who knows they have to save 20%, 15% or whatever it turns out to be for a deposit, that could have a beneficial effect on private pensions because people in their early twenties will put aside a certain amount of their income as they know they have to save for a deposit.  The day they get their mortgage, that fraction of their income that they save is switched from saving for a deposit to saving for a pension so there could be a beneficial effect on savings behaviour.

Being from Cork and being a landlord - for my sins - we do not have the same issue as is being experienced in Dublin but that is not to say that it may not happen.  The situation now might have come about for different reasons.  In the past it may have been caused by profit-taking by people who were buying and selling and there was an element of frenzy in the market.  Dublin now has high employment levels and highly-paid employment and people want to live close to their work.  Therefore, they are prepared to pay that bit extra and they can afford to do so but this is creating pressure on everyone else and especially those in the social realm.  Mr. Burgess has referred to rents of &euro;1,500 a month in Dublin, but rents in Cork which had been &euro;1,000 a month for a typical two-bedroom apartment, dropped to &euro;750 a month and have risen to &euro;900 a month and the value of the properties are still only about 45% of their previous value.  We are nowhere near.<\/p><p>  We should speak about the categories of those for whom we need to provide housing.  For example, the garda and the nurse couple are looking for a house but other different members of society are also looking for housing.  A councillor in Cork recently recommended that a person should have at least two or three children in order to get on the housing list.  I am not making any judgments but it is something we need to take into account.  There are a high number of family break-ups which in many cases result in a requirement for two houses for a family in that a parent living alone will need to provide accommodation for the visiting children.  Demand is building from a variety of sectors.  It is difficult to provide the correct balance when framing legislation.  Sometimes when one speaks about this situation one is accused of being cold-hearted with regard to very difficult human circumstances.<\/p><p>  Many landlords, including myself, would prefer not be landlords - we would love to be able to disappear out of that sector.  We came in during the high times and we are losing money every week, month and year.  We have borne the brunt to date and there is talk now of caps on rent.  That is the other side of the argument.  Now would be a nice time to be coming into the market.  However, that group of investors are still there and those who are paying their way are still being punished for their bad decisions.<\/p><p>  The cost of building a home in Cork and Kerry and other parts of the country is still greater than the cost of purchasing a house.  While our conversation is important in the context of Dublin we need to distinguish the regions.  It could be that the answers for the Dublin situation may also be the answers for Cork and the rest of the country in the future as things lift.  We need to discuss the type of housing we need.  I do not agree that everybody in Dublin needs a three-bedroom semi.  We should have considered building proper high rise buildings.  The only reason we built three-storey houses was in order to squeeze more rooms into a lower footprint but a three-storey house is impractical for family living.  We then built progressively smaller apartments and because the owners could not sell them they are finding them impractical accommodation for raising a family.  It may be necessary to build high-rise buildings in the Dublin area unless we want to have people travelling long distances from outside the city.  A significant conversation is needed in this regard.<\/p><p> It was not so long ago that ghost estates were the topic of conversation.  People were house-hopping; they would rent a house and then move on to a nicer, newer house.  This hopping was at a severe cost to the landlords.  <\/p><p>  There is a sizeable problem of anti-social behaviour in many estates - although this is not particularly confined to social housing.  Landlords have to deal regularly with this behaviour.  Certain tenants can make life miserable for everyone else.  There are no mechanisms for dealing with people who are not behaving as is appropriate in a community situation.  I ask for the views of the delegates on those points. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700021#V00300","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417092300,"counter":888,"content":"<p>On the difference between Cork and Dublin, one of the issues with mortgage indemnity insurance is that the insurance companies will probably not provide it in areas where they consider the price is too high.

If we take the income of a couple - the classic garda and nurse pairing - for example, their income does not vary at all from one area of the country to another as they are on public sector pay scales.  For a family with &euro;50,000 a year in gross income, to be sustainable, a house can cost no more, including land and everything, than &euro;150,000.  One can buy a house for less than that in many parts of the country but if it is not possible to build for that price - we will run into a problem in the future because of the increase in population.  It is certain it is not possible to build for anything like that in Dublin.  The image of renting for a certain generation is that of the bed-sit, a room in an old house; for the next generation it means paper-thin walls in an apartment built in the 1990s, somewhere along the quays.  However, people in other countries live in rented accommodation for all their lives.  In that case, they are good quality units in which anyone would wish to live.  There are such actors in the Irish market now but unfortunately it is limited by the high cost and certain oddities relating to the minimum specification about lifts and stairwells and orientation and car parking spaces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700021#V01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Lyons"},{"type":"speech","time":1417092300,"counter":898,"content":"<p>I am conscious that we are running out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700021#V01400","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417092300,"counter":899,"content":"<p>I have concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700021#V01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Lyons"},{"type":"speech","time":1417092300,"counter":900,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Paul Joyce to make some points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700021#V01600","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417092900,"counter":901,"content":"<p>The points the Deputy makes raise the question of how the dots will be joined up in this conversation.

At the same time, there was an announcement yesterday on construction, social housing and so on.  It seems a much greater timeframe is needed in which to have a wide-ranging discussion on housing policy in this country.  It should include mortgages, social housing, private rented accommodation, etc.  Instead of having this discussion, we are now having a conversation about mortgage insurance schemes in the context of people having to raise too high a deposit.

I found them very informative and enjoyed them also.  &quot;Enjoyment&quot; is a word I do not use at meetings of this committee too often as we are usually bogged down with very serious and heavy financial stuff.  The delegates put their views across very fairly and clearly.<br\/>Let me dig in a little deeper based on what the committee is tasked with.  This matter has evolved in quite a strange way.  Earlier this year, Construction 2020 included a commitment that the mortgage insurance scheme would be rolled out by the Government after economic analysis.  Its inclusion in the Finance Bill was to depend on the economic analysis.  It now appears it is over to this committee.  This is it; it is we who are making the proposal to the Government on this.  Therefore, the delegates' input is very much welcome.<br\/>I actually came out against this scheme when it was originally mooted.  I questioned the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on this.  The transcript states:<blockquote>All we are talking about anyway is the State [we were talking about the State at that time] covering 10% or 15% of a mortgage for a limited period, to get somebody over the hump and into a house.  Then they might get promoted at work after the five years or whatever is the time period we decide.  It would be for first-time buyers and there would be a capital cap on it.  We will return to the issue again.  If I proceed, it will be announced in the Finance Bill.<\/blockquote>Obviously, the Government is no longer thinking about State involvement but about private sector insurance, with the possibility of caps.  We have to discuss caps and I would like the delegates' views on them.  If we were to proceed, would it be important to have caps?<br\/>As I stated, I do not support increasing the loan-to-value ratio to 95%, which was the Minister's intention.  The Minister suggested that, while it failed in London, it increased supply by 30% outside London.  He argues this is a supply issue.  I am not suggesting it is but would like the delegates to comment on that.<br\/>With regard to phasing in, Mr. Burgess mentioned an arrangement such as the one under discussion.  We are making a mess of this.  When I say &quot;we&quot;, I am talking about the institutions of the State.  My hunch is that the Government announced the increasing of the loan-to-value ratio to 95% without proper thinking.  The Central Bank was not all too happy.  The flag was budget day so the Central Bank said it was reducing the loan-to-value ratio to 80%.  Mr. Deeter said he does not agree with either ratio.  There is a genuine question to be asked.  We have two different proposals that are not running together and we are supposed to be making a determination on each of them.  The big problem is that if the Central Bank goes in with an 80% loan-to-value ratio, which we probably need in Ireland, we must ask what it would do when there is a social housing crisis, a rental market crisis and a lack of property.  How do we fix the problem at this point?  Is mortgage insurance a part of the solution?<br\/>Do the delegates believe this will deal with the supply-side?  With regard to loan-to-value ratios, if mortgage insurance were to be introduced what limits should apply?  Do the delegates believe 95%, which is the conventional percentage across areas where this operates, is the appropriate figure?  Should it be lower?  Do they agree that if mortgage insurance were introduced, it should be targeted at first-time buyers?  Do they believe in caps?  Alternatively, do they believe we should stay 100 million miles away from this on the grounds that there are other issues to be resolved and that mortgage insurance is not part of the solution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700022#W00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417092900,"counter":903,"content":"<p>If the Central Bank brings in a loan-to-value ratio of 80% on 1 January, as proposed, and we do not have mortgage insurance or anything else in place, it will make the problem far worse.  People who are now thinking of building houses will not build them because there might not be buyers available for them, certainly in Dublin.  I do not know the position in Cork well enough.  If the cost of building in Cork is higher than the sale price, they will not be building in Cork anyway.  That is the first point.<\/p><p>  I suggest that a limit be introduced on 1 January, and that should probably be 90%.  It should be indicated that it will be reduced in time.  This would then allow us to deal with the question of how we help first-time buyers to buy houses.  Perhaps we should reduce the limit from 90% down to 80% in time but leave it at 90% for first-time buyers, or leave it at 90% for new houses.  My main concern is that if limits or any changes are introduced suddenly, it might exacerbate the worst problem we are all experiencing, namely, the shortage of housing.  I would like to see the limit introduced in time.  I do not want to see mortgage indemnity insurance but I believe first-time buyers must be helped.

The journalist states:<blockquote><br \/>It [mortgage insurance] is one of the reasons why Canadian banks continued to lend mortgages even in the tumultuous years after the financial crisis.  Thanks to that, spending on homes and construction has given the economy a big hand.<\/blockquote>Therefore, there would seem to be a supply effect.  However, the journalist also states:<blockquote>But mortgage insurance has also inflated home prices by allowing people to buy homes they otherwise couldn&rsquo;t afford.

Most of this is about bank protection; it is not going to solve the supply problem.  No one is suggesting 100% mortgages, but 100% mortgages valued at seven times one's income have a lower default rate than 90% mortgages three or four times the income.  How does one explain that?  I do not know that it can be easily explained away given the empirical evidence.  The empirical evidence does not indicate it solves anything to do with supply.  The Canadians are saying they have had a positive supply experience but they probably did not have the type of oversupply and collapse we had.  They did have a collapse in the early 1990s, and it was expensive and they learned hard lessons from it, just as the Americans did with the savings and loan crisis.  However, if there is an absence of housing and one keeps people out of the market, it just means rents go up.  Rents have an implication for capital values, and capital values increase.  Therefore, there will still be a lifting on both sides, no matter what one tries to do to get away from it.  No one has the alternative of some kind of substitution, which basically involves living in a box or something.  That alternative does not exist in any of the categories, including social housing and private housing.  I do not know whether this will fix anything concerning phenomena such as housing standards.<\/p><p>  If one wants a conversation about what we need to do, it should cover the relaxing of building regulations.  According to the building regulations, the height limit for new builds in Dublin is 13 m although a Georgian house is 21 m tall.  How does one explain that?  We are actually saying one must construct buildings that are lower than those built in 1710.  There are many stupid things.  Mr. Lyons did a piece on the television some days ago in which it was said one cannot construct a north-facing apartment.  There are so many factors that prevent supply that I cannot really envisage how the proposal in question will resolve the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700022#W00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Karl Deeter"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417093500,"counter":906,"content":"<p>Every economist in the country shed a little tear when the Minister for Finance spoke about tackling supply by boosting demand.

It is the worst way to tackle the problem so I favour credit rationing.  My research suggests that if one increased the loan to value a first-time buyer receives by 5% then one will  increase house prices by 10%.  Therefore, going the other way should have a similar effect on dampening house prices.  A phasing-in period needed.  My preference is for a 1% increase per year so that means it will increase from 15% in 2015 to 20% in 2020 which would get us to where we need to be.

Should the deviation be for homes that are capped or for first-time buyers?  Has the delegation views on the matter?  Recently I had an opportunity to spend 24 hours in Canada.  In a couple of years' time I do not think we will be talking about Canada as an example for anything as I think it is in for another big shock and a lot of people will be hit hard as a result.  I would like the delegation to focus on my question on the 15% deviation.<\/p><p>  I think Mr. Deeter mentioned that the loan to value ratio breaks the link between income and the value of a house.  It is my understanding that this insurance model supports the banks but not the individual and it will be very rare that one will end up in one's own house.  The insurance model will ensure one does not lose one's home.  If one has a lower loan to value ratio there is more likelihood that one will stay in one's house even if the economy and house prices collapse.  That is a protection afforded by the scheme although difficulties will still exist.<\/p><p>  Income limits have been retained.

I refer to the limits themselves.  The Governor of the Central Bank appeared before the committee yesterday and indicated that the intention in introducing these limits is effectively prudence within the financial system as opposed to looking at borrower interest <i>per se<\/i>.  It is really more in the context of its role as the arbiters of the financial system.<\/p> <p>Do the witnesses think that the limits on loan to income and loan-to-value ratios set out in the report by the Governor are the correct limits?  While there is a limited amount of room for manoeuvre within the ceilings set out, is there a real linkage between those limits and a person's capacity to reasonably afford housing?<\/p><p> The witnesses partly answered my next question of whether a mortgage insurance scheme should be limited to first-time buyers.  If the witnesses do not think it should be limited to first-time borrowers, what category of borrowers should be included in such a scheme?<\/p><p> I am happy that some of our discussion has referred to the general question of home ownership rather than focusing specifically on mortgage insurance schemes.  Several witnesses appear to think the introduction of these limits, and the timeline on them, are premature because we need a broader debate on home ownership.  One of the issues that regularly arises is housing supply.  Some of the evidence presented to us this morning in regard to the UK indicated that similar mortgage deposit schemes have stimulated supply.  Some of the witnesses appear to disagree with this.  To what extent do they accept that a mortgage insurance scheme would improve supply?<\/p><p> The Governor indicated that he does not think access to credit creates greater equality.  I am not convinced that is so.  If one considers, for example, the type of finance available to people on lower incomes through the local authorities in the 1970s and 1980s, it is not true to say that access to finance for lower income households did not create equality.  Access to finance offered access to assets, which does in fact provide more equality in society.  I will not outline the data but I can assure the witnesses that numerous journal articles have been written on the subject.  If we do not go down the road of putting in place some means whereby people who have a capacity to pay, in other words, they are going to be paying rents that are possibly higher than the amount of mortgage they are asked to pay but do not have the resources to come up with a deposit of 20%, are effectively being locked out of life opportunities that will enable them to have the type of asset base that other people who are lucky enough to have wealthy parents can access.  Given that some of these are societal issues - I accept they are not necessarily issues for the Central Bank - and that the committee has been asked by the Minister for Finance to consider this question because he wants our views on it, is there an interface between regulation and issues that are important to society?  How do we deal with those issues, if that is not too broad a question?<\/p><p> Dr. Lyons referred to apartment developments.  I had reason recently to be involved in a very extensive discussion about apartment developments in Ireland during the Celtic tiger years.  He asked why we need higher space standards in Ireland than apply in Copenhagen or Barcelona.  Apart from the fact that we had pathetic design in this country between 1990 and approximately 2005 - I make no excuse for saying that - we do not have communal facilities or services and our society does not have a history of apartment living.  For these reasons, it is a broader issue than the internal four walls of any particular apartment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700024#Y01800","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417094700,"counter":938,"content":"<p>There should be a limit of 80% generally.  In particular, it should be on people who are buying a second home.  Nobody buying a second home or trading up should borrow more than 80%.  By definition, second time buyers would not need mortgage indemnity insurance.  In the longer term I would like to see a limit of 80% on first time buyers.  I am surprised Dr. Lyons suggested that if we reduced the limit to 80% now it would not affect the supply of housing.  My gut feeling is that it would affect supply.  I would make an exception to the 80% limit for first time buyers and, probably, for new houses.  However, I like the overall limit of 80% and if a mortgage indemnity guarantee is introduced, it could only be for first time buyers because they would be the only people allowed to borrow more than 80%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700025#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Burgess"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417094700,"counter":939,"content":"<p>The equality issue is important.  It is argued that the introduction of regulation will price certain people out of the market and they will, therefore, be disadvantaged.  Senator Hayden gave the example of somebody with rich parents who can afford to pay the deposit and, therefore, has an advantage over somebody who does not have rich parents.  The reality is, however, those parents are there anyway and if the two borrowers are competing in the market in the absence of the 20% deposit, the child of rich parents will have extra cash to outbid the person without rich parents.  That example does not hold water when it is analysed and, ultimately, those who come from better off backgrounds simply have more access to money or credit.  They have more purchasing power, however it comes, and the price will be driven up.  I genuinely believe the Governor is correct in that too much credit in the system leads to gross inequality.  I cannot stand over any particular academic data but my sense is that Ireland is a more unequal society now than it was some years ago.  That is partly the result of excess credit.  The Governor pointed to the important example of the United States, where credit is freely available but where inequality is at an unacceptable level.

That is where the conversation needs to be.  Equality in terms of credit is like ninja loans, that is, no income, no job, no assets.  That has terrible outcomes.  I am glad to see, after five years of chatting with Senator Hayden, that we agree on something.  She was referring to the fact that housing wealth is actually the main wealth in the world.  To take the example offered by Mr. Maguire of two different people, one of whom has rich parents, we are not saying they are bidding for two different houses but the person who gets locked out stays renting.  Every month he or she has a fixed overhead because housing is an overhead that cannot be avoided, and the person in the mortgaged house also has an overhead.  The difference is that the person in the mortgaged house has a balance sheet improvement every time he or she makes a payment, whereas the person in the rented house does not.  One can speak about equality but this is really a question of wealth and it goes beyond the argument of equality, which is total bunk.  Ultimately it is about lifetime wealth.  The Central Bank says this is about prudence.  That is fine but prudence does not cost the bank.  Prudence comes at a cost to the people who are locked out and are forced into this life of reduced wealth that we have just described.  If they have access to an insurance scheme, they also have to pay the fee for a bond.  It is claimed this will stop people from taking on more than they can handle.  One can stay in the rental market and take on more than one can handle.<\/p> <p>The level of rent arrears is very high and local authorities, in this regard, make those who dealt in sub-prime mortgages look like risk experts.  The rent arrears situation for local authorities is absolutely catastrophic.<\/p><p> If a person can save money while paying a high rent at a time of high taxes it is proof he or she can carry a mortgage.  The loan to value ratio is not the question; it is a matter of cost.  If interest rates are forecast to be low, as they are for the next three years, then it means our capacity to raise interest rates will have a lower ceiling before the next recession kicks in so I cannot say that this move will have any societal benefit.

It is extraordinary to us that after an era with no controls on lending, despite calls for prudence, we now have a paper proposing to introduce limits on 1 January that suddenly must be implemented very quickly.  There are still serious and detailed questions to be considered.  The questions asked from the Chair are excellent and very important for a debate like this.  Regarding affordability, the consultation paper suggests a three and a half times loan to income ratio should be the limit but this does not take into account other debts that must be serviced.  The paper simultaneously uses the term \"debt servicing to income ratio\".  There is a huge difference between a person who comes into a mortgage carrying unsecured debt, for example, relating to credit cards, personal loans, various types of insurance and so on, and a debt-free person who borrows using a three and a half times loan to income ratio.  In trying to define \"affordability\" in any application, surely a person's entire financial circumstances must be taken into account.  Without a fully-functioning full disclosure and central credit register, how can this be done?  It may seem surprising for FLAC to take this view but we should proceed slowly.  There is some truth in the assertion that, at the moment, creditors are mostly self-policing, for understandable reasons.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to have a wide-ranging and lengthy debate on hugely important issues for the future of credit and housing in Ireland.  There is a tension in the paper between access and potential difficulties, particularly repeated consumer over-indebtedness.  This is a difficult area to address quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700026#AA00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Joyce"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417095300,"counter":945,"content":"<p>On the first question, regarding exact limits and loan to value ratios, I agree with Mr. Brendan Burgess that 20% is the right amount but this should not be done overnight.  A gradual increase from 15% to 20% would be better.  We can talk about loan to income ratios in more detail if that would be of use but I do not think they are necessary once one has a loan to value ratio.  I think loan to income ratios can do more damage.  If the average house in Dublin is worth &euro;400,000 and the average house outside Dublin is worth less than &euro;200,000 the loan to income ratio could be binding in Dublin and not in the rest of the country, in which case it would have no impact outside Dublin.  If it was binding outside Dublin one can only imagine the havoc it would wreak in the Dublin market, unless one would prefer a situation where only people with twice the average income can buy in Dublin.  Loan to value is sufficient and loan to income can make matters worse, rather than better.<\/p><p>  The question was raised as to whether deposit schemes increase supply.  I may have misspoken earlier as I think deposit schemes increase supply in the most dangerous way possible.  Quantities may be increased but this can only be done by first increasing the price and increasing the price of homes by giving more credit is the last thing we should do.  If prices and costs are at a certain level one may approach the matter in two ways: one can increase prices, which is dangerous, or one can push costs down and this is a far healthier approach.  If the Government chooses to simply give more credit it will have failed to grasp the nettle of the cost of building family homes compared to incomes.<\/p><p>  On credit inequality, the reason we accept rent payments that are higher than mortgage repayments is mortgages are basically potential weapons of financial destruction - we in Ireland, of all places, must not forget that.  Ask a person with negative equity of over &euro;100,000 whether he or she would have liked consumer protection ten years ago and that person will answer \"yes\".  People are not as financially literate as we would like to think and they need consumer protection.<\/p><p>  On communal facilities, the only reason we have units from the 1990s and early 2000s is tax breaks.  If the market was asked to provide units it would provide a very different kind of unit.  Communal facilities are part of this and in the US developers are now building units for families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700026#AA00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Lyons"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417095300,"counter":946,"content":"<p>May I make an important point on loan to income ratio?

Having been in the lending business since 1979, I have seen a couple of cycles and recoveries and this experience helped me to determine the scale of losses for the Irish domestic banking scene.  The Governor spoke of credit in the economy and so on but, in big picture terms, between 2001 and 2008, we grew from having a domestic banking sector three times the size of the national income to one five and a half times the size of the national income.  This was madness as the incomes generated from the production of goods and services must be the servicing capability for national debt and household debt.<\/p><p>  Up to 1985 household debt and the financing of housing were funded on a mutual basis in society.  Long-term savings were used as funding for housing through the intermediaries that were building societies - later this applied to banks too.  The arrival of new forms of financial engineering meant this was all lost as banks went mad increasing the reckless funding of their balance sheets - this was the engine of growth that delivered reckless lending.  Financial commentators in Ireland have not made the connection that this lending could not have happened without crazy funding.  The funding was the creation and responsibility of the boards of directors of financial institutions.  These boards of directors have tiptoed off the stage and have not been asked to explain why they allowed the floor of the funding of the nation's fixed assets to become perilous.<\/p><p>  We have heard that residential property values in Dublin have gone up by 23% in the past year but this is another big lie.  It is a lie because the prices of transactions may be calibrated to have risen by 23% but the level of transactions as a volume is only one third of the normalised levels of transactions for a city of 1.25 million people.<\/p> <p>As Mr. Deeter indicated, these are being funded to a great extent by cash, which has come from legacies, family transfers and savings that have no other place.  Deposits are only paying less than 1% so people who have liquidity are bidding up the prices in the lower volume of transactions.  It would be truthful for commentators and analysts to say that values in Dublin may have risen by approximately a quarter of 23%, or perhaps 5%.  We should cross-check the figure.<\/p><p> When somebody or a couple enters a mortgage for 35 years when they are in their 20s, what is the alternative for the accommodation of their lifetime?  What about a 35-year lease?  Would that person or couple enter a 35 year lease for similar monthly commitments over the profile of the mortgage loan?  It is a direct comparison.  We hear about loan to value but what are people talking about in God's name?  Is it the price of a couple of transactions that may have occurred on a road or neighbourhood?  That would also be crazy.  The rental value of a house - the subject of the transaction - is more important.  What is the normalised, maintainable rental value?  Whether a person is repaying a mortgage or a 35 year lease, it is a similar prospect for the accommodation of a house.<\/p><p> We heard a number floated of &euro;400,000 for a semi-detached house in a Dublin suburb.  If that three-bedroom house rents for &euro;1,500 per month, at a 7% yield or 15-times multiple, the &euro;1,500 would be &euro;18,000 per year and &euro;270,000 gross, before making any depreciation provision for the refurbishment and repair of the house over the 15 years.  That is the economic value of the house.  Alternatively, one can consider that if there is a mortgage of 35 years, what are the likely averages - in lumps of ten years - of interest rates over the 35 years.  I remember paying 15% on my mortgage in 1981 and 1982.  That was a variable interest loan.  People get stuck on what is happening now but that is very unreal.  There are trillions of euro sloshing around in financial markets, with negative real interest rates.<\/p><p> We must be very careful in joining the cogs in the market.  We know there is an undersupply of housing, as 100,000 families are searching for a home.  We also know that from the splurge of the reckless funding which led to reckless lending, there are another 100,000 households in deep mortgage distress.  There is no worry about the banks getting into a gallop of credit expansion again, as they are trying to pull back and correct the funding models they have.  They are doing that by putting a strain on the assets, or the loans they gave out in the past.  They are doing horrible and unconscionable things to families.  They now have people imprisoned for 20 years.  The split mortgages are utter nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700026#AA00800","speaker":"1183","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417095900,"counter":950,"content":"<p>I am just wondering if the Deputy wishes to allow time for a response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700027#BB00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1417095900,"counter":951,"content":"<p>We are trying to join all these cogs or facts.

It is interesting that the Central Bank's consultation paper discusses affordability in the context of mortgage borrowing but not of rent payments.  If the Central Bank is saying that the loan amount should be capped at 3.5 times the gross income, equating to 40% of gross income, does that standard apply to rent?  As is laid out in our submission, the average rent for a house in Dublin is currently about &euro;1,300, and there are a lot of people paying far higher rents than that.  A figure of 40% of net income would mean that a household paying this average in rent would have to have an income of nearly &euro;3,200 per month, in other words &euro;735.58 take-home pay per week.  The average wage - not the average industrial wage - is &euro;688.15 per week so there are clearly a lot of people, certainly in Dublin, who are paying much more than 40% of their net take-home pay in rent.  The case that Senator Craughwell makes for rent controls is, in my view, very strong.  If we control the amount that people can borrow without controlling the amount that landlords can charge people, which in some cases works out to be more than mortgage payments would be, that is an unconscionable situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700029#DD00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Joyce"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417097100,"counter":994,"content":"<p>We have a bit of a paradox with the rental market because everybody talks about how bad the Irish rental market is and when renters are surveyed they say the Irish rental market is bad for renters.  However, when they are asked about their own experience, overwhelmingly renters have had very good experiences in the market.  I am not trying to pretend there are no issues with it, but it is a bit of a conundrum that nobody seems able to say they are personally losing out.  Everyone says they know that people find it very tough.<\/p><p>  My worry with rent control is that is damages precisely the people whom we are trying to help.  For example, say we have capped rent on a two-bed property at &euro;1,300 and now the landlord has a choice of tenants.  The rent is a signal that we need more units built.  If we stop that signal we might have some positive side effects in the short term, but in the long run we actually hurt the chances of new units being built.  A glorified version of what is currently happening to people on rent supplement will happen in the rental market.  Landlords will be saying they do not want anyone on rent supplement, they do not want students, and they do not want groups of young professionals.  They will only want to let to high-income couples with small children.  There will be all sorts of discrimination.  We can bring certainty around rent increases into the market, but as far as rent control is concerned, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  The group that will get hit by it is not the group in this room, but those on the lowest incomes.<\/p><p>  The points made by Deputy Mathews and Senator Craughwell tie together and hopefully tie in with some of the comments I made earlier.  Linking house prices to rental value and to incomes leaves us with the uncomfortable fact that the costs do not stack up.  There is a troika - this is Peter Stafford's phrase, not mine - in the Irish housing market that is not yet aware that it is a troika, namely, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  They effectively control the housing market but they do not do so in a joined-up way.  We have measures that affect the mortgage market with no follow-up.  I have discussed this with the Governor, whose response is that unfortunately he can only do what is in his remit.  He cannot force the Department of Finance or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to do the other bits.  He can only do what he believes is best, and in his case, he has control over loan to value or loan to income.<\/p><p>  On the issue of loan to income, I understand the point about bad lenders.  The problem, coming back to Senator Barrett's point, is that the houses we now have require a greater investment relative to our incomes because most of the good additions to the minimum standards are about lowering energy bills.  To lower energy bills, one needs to make a bigger upfront investment.  That is good maths, because requiring people to have a certain minimum degree of insulation means they get the savings.  That is, of course, a greater multiple of their income when we are just looking at the mortgage debt, but if we add mortgage, petrol, heating and electricity as the total stock of mortgage debt and related outgoings, we get a very different picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700029#DD00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Lyons"},{"type":"speech","time":1417097100,"counter":995,"content":"<p>We could, of course, have a major debate about the issue of rent certainty or rent control, but that might be for another day.

In a previous life I practised law and when I first started doing conveyancing as a solicitor, dealing with banks and building societies was a very different scenario from how it was subsequently in the latter part of the 1990s and into the 2000s.  Somebody virtually had to have their communion money with a building society for 15 or 20 years in order to be able to make an application for a loan.  Deputy Mathews made the point that life did not begin and end in 1995 or 1996.  There was an entirely different banking system back then that was far from throwing money at people.  One practically had to take a secret vow down in some hidden chamber in order to be able to access finance.<\/p><p>  One of the issues about mortgage insurance was that there was a product, not exactly the same kind of product as we have been discussing, on the market in those days.

The point was raised that people now have very insecure positions.  Many people are on contract employment and are not in full-time permanent and pensionable jobs.

Obviously there are ways to waive that.  There are certain conditions - one can be over a certain age, have been loaded, have been refused, be buying an investment property, etc., but we actually put in mandatory insurance for the event that is probably least likely to happen.  I have always wondered about that, when other events, such as a period of unemployment, are far more likely to happen.  If those involved in the activity should be paying for the indemnity, as is generally the principle in indemnity - one must have privity or some kind of interaction with what is occurring - a scheme where anyone who takes any mortgage pays a certain percentage or a certain amount of payment towards a general pool of insurance, something like that could work very well.  It would help people that it would be paid if they entered into the mortgage arrears resolution process.  It would encourage them to deal with the bank and not hide from the bank.  The incentives would be much better aligned to provide for the risks they really face, rather than forcing insurance for the thing that is least likely to happen and which, because it is not built into the payment, the person can actually cancel in most cases.  There are people in arrears who cancel their insurance and then they die and the mortgage is still there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700030#EE00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Karl Deeter"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417097700,"counter":1003,"content":"<p>It is correct.  The only obligatory insurance is life cover under the terms of section 126, but as Mr. Deeter said and as I said earlier, many of those policies have lapsed, because people are in arrears.  It is obligatory because often the borrowers are joint borrowers.  The death of one party is a final event, and the cover is there to pay off the principal for the remaining spouse and, often, children.  Therefore, it might be seen as an essential insurance.  Redundancy protection policies have been in place, as well as policies for critical illness, and so on.  As I understand it, the premiums are quite high and there has been a fair degree of mis-selling.  For example, people on fixed-term contracts were sold policies that only apply to people in permanent employment.  Very little checking went on at the time.  People were sold critical illness cover only to find that the illness they suddenly develop is not on the defined list of illnesses under the policy, and so on.  Reference was made earlier to the true cost of the mortgage, the energy costs and so on.  One must also factor in the various types of insurance one might take out - life cover and so on.

Often when people die, the life cover does not actually cover the loan.  We have this view that it wipes it out.  In fact, one can often have big deficits.  For example if one had an arrear, or if the interest rate applied on the insurance policy was 4% but over the life of the loan the actual interest rate was 5%, one does not match the other.  Often borrowers go into arrears and it is the one time where someone with a ruined credit history is still mortgageable because one just shows a death certificate and that explains it away.  There are many nuances to it, but there are better ways of doing all this stuff that do not involve lending caps or introducing mortgage insurance.

The witnesses were looking back over the period in terms of house prices going out of control and so forth.  The 20% deposit is a very crude instrument in terms of the price of houses.  In the Irish psyche there is an aspiration to own a home.  We are different from other countries like Germany, in which there is a huge rental market.  Property should not become the preserve of the rich, and I am nervous that will happen with this 20% deposit requirement.  It means that is someone is buying a &euro;200,000 home, they must come up with a &euro;40,000 deposit.  That is clearly excessive.  At the same time there is negative equity at the moment.  This has put young couples in particular in a terrible situation, because in many cases they ended up buying apartments and much smaller homes.  They were told that property would appreciate in value and now they are stuck in many cases.<\/p><p>  What is the sustainable model?  This seems to be a very crude instrument.  The proposed mortgage interest premium model, under which it will be covered by an insurance premium, means they will probably end up paying the same amount.  That is certain.  It is as though, if one is being covered by 10%, one is paying the full amount of the mortgage.  How do we deal with supply issues?  Dr. Lyons said it was about loan to value rather than income.  I am not certain I agree with him on that, because a couple could, through no fault of their own, have had a peak in income.  During the Celtic tiger they might have qualified for mortgages they should not have received - six or seven times earnings and the application done on the back of a shoebox.  They might have bought a house.  They might have had savings and been able to get a mortgage with a a loan to value ratio of 80% or 90%.  Then suddenly their income drops and they cannot meet their mortgage.  It is a crude instrument.  It means the lender can move on them and sell the house, but it is a very financial instrument that works for the lender, but not the borrower.  <\/p><p>  I am asking the witnesses what instruments they would put in place to take account of supply.  Mr. Deeter referred to this as well.  How could we ensure people do not get into negative equity and can afford mortgage repayments on a sustainable basis?  What we put in place now will probably only manifest itself in ten years time.  What was put in place during the Celtic tiger and many places where people bought in 2002, 2003 and 2004 only manifested itself five or six years later when it crashed, or, at this stage, ten years later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700030#EE01100","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417097700,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>The Deputy is saying that people are stuck in negative equity now.

I believe that during the Celtic tiger era, with Ireland joining the euro system, interest rates came down overnight - effectively making excess credit available - and prices rose.  In fact, at one stage, mortgage interest relief was taken away from rental properties and the price of property stabilised.  The following year that instrument was reversed and the price of property rose.  The instrument of bringing in a rule of 20% deposit for houses means that it has been decided that a significant section of the population will never aspire to own their homes.  I do not believe that is correct.  What instruments can be put in place to ensure that the price of property does not go out of control?

Even in places where they have insurance people are lending more than 90%.  All it does is protect the banks.  If one is looking for the best outcome for the individual and the institutions, they should take out insurance themselves.  Let them insure their own activities, but if one increases the Central Bank mandated stress test that we already have from 2% to 3%, which is what the Hong Kong monetary authority did as well, one would de-risk the lending within the existing models, which are prudent good models.

One would have basically switched people to fixed interest rates and given them security of repayment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700032#GG00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Lyons"},{"type":"speech","time":1417098900,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>Just before you all leave, Deputy Mathews has an additional question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014112700032#GG00800","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1417098900,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>In the overall parameters, the two big banks each have total loan books of about &euro;95 billion net of provisions in their overall lending.

Since then, we have witnessed many changes.  When I started work there, homosexual acts were illegal and condoms were not freely available.  I suppose the context I want to give is that HIV allows us to look at how we need different strategies over the years.<\/p><p>  Since we have effective treatments for HIV, people with HIV can lead a healthy life.  The treatments also reduce the amount of virus in people's systems and, therefore, they are less likely to pass it on to others.  The effect of the treatments means that we can really promote testing and look at the opportunities for testing in community sectors and different types of testing.  Essentially, that is what we will talk about today.  It gives us the possibility of reducing infections.<\/p><p>  The context of HIV is fear and stigma.  There is a still a huge stigma around HIV and a denial of the risk.  I am constantly asked why are there still people getting HIV.  There is almost one person per day in Ireland newly infected with HIV.  It is preventable.  We know how people get it and still the new infections are basically the same.  That is why we are focusing on the effectiveness of prevention, both human and financial.<\/p><p>  There are three aspects to this that I will outline in my brief contribution: promotion, access and outreach.  Promotion has to be targeted at the communities that we feel are most at risk of HIV without losing the focus on the heterosexual population, who still make up a large number of those with HIV.  It is a matter of achieving that combination.  This is EU testing week.  We have got Irish AIDS Day, World AIDS Day and, of course, St. Valentine's week as well.  These are all big focal points where the media is interested in promoting testing and we have to ensure that we get as much free publicity as we can out of those.<\/p><p>  On access, there are STI clinics in most of the major parts of the country.  They offer free and specialist services.  They are busy, they have waiting times but they are very good services, and we work hand in hand with those.  They give full STI screening.<\/p><p>  On top of that, one of the aspects that will be highlighted in the national sexual health strategy is looking at other ways, including community testing.  At Sexual Health Centre and Gender, Orientation Sexual, Health, HIV, GOSHH, in Limerick, we have rapid HIV testing - a simply finger-prick or saliva test with results in 20 minutes.  It is an opportunity to get people to come in and talk.  They feel relief when they can come in and talk about their risks, or sometimes they have not been at risk at all and they are just anxious about the fact that they might have put themselves at risk.  Then there is the link that we can have in to the STI screening.  If people have put themselves at risk, we can refer them to the STI clinic for full screening.  Dublin AIDS Alliance works with St. James's Hospital and, therefore, has a different outreach service where St. James's Hospital does it in the Dublin AIDS Alliance's building.  Those are examples of community testing.  In the United Kingdom, they are exploring the opportunity of testing for migrant communities in churches.<\/p><p>  Community testing offers a huge opportunity.  We have got out-of-hours services because our research showed that people want out-of-hours services as well as nine-to-five services.  It is a safe and non-clinical environment.  People can talk.  They can get their relief.<\/p><p>  It is cost effective.  We have to charge for it at present because we had to prove that people would do it.  We have to charge &euro;50, on a sliding scale to free.  If people need a repeat test, that is always free.  We know that the times when we offer it free, we get more people coming for testing and the next stage is how to improve access to free community testing.<\/p><p>  It is very simple.  There is rapid turnaround and people do not have to wait a week for the results.  They know that if they come, they will know within 20 minutes whether they have HIV or not, so long as they are not in the window period.<\/p><p>  The other opportunity that it gives us is for early diagnosis.  When people are newly infected with HIV, they are more infectious.<\/p> <p>If we can catch people quite early, they can be referred on.  We have very good referral routes onto the specialists in the hospitals and they can go on the treatment route.  If they know their status and know they are highly infectious, they are less likely to pass on the infection to other people.  It is a win-win situation.  Mr. Foley will talk about the home testing.<\/p><p> The other aspect we can offer in the NGO sector is outreach work.  In our case the outreach work is targeted at men who have sex with men and hidden populations.  Many of the men who have sex with men do not identify as gay.  So we have to be creative in how we access people who are in risk behaviours.  We have to know our populations.  We have a very good health intelligence service now from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  It now has a system whereby it gives us accurate and up-to-date statistics so that we can understand the diversity of populations affected and apply them.<\/p><p> I am also involved in the European Joint Action on Improving Quality in HIV Prevention.  That is looking at applying tools so that we are really structured in how we improve quality in HIV prevention.  So there are many initiatives going on.<\/p><p> Where do we go from here and how?  We still have almost one person a day newly affected with HIV.  Over half the people are diagnosed late, which is not good from a health point of view.  We have to increase promotion and access.  We have the opportunity for leadership.  The national sexual health strategy has been sitting in the Department of Health for more than a year.  It offers the opportunity to get us all together to work across sectors.  It is being modelled on the national HIV strategy committee and we really need to get that out.  That is something members of the committee can do.  We need to get the national sexual health strategy launched, which will give us the opportunity to work together to develop an implementation plan.<\/p><p> The way HIV has developed is a really good model for responding to a health problem.  It involves reflection, focused on continual improvement, strategic work, working across sectors, and effective use of scarce resources.  Essentially we focus on doing the right thing at the right time in the right way, constantly reflecting and constantly responding to the needs of HIV prevention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014112700003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Seery","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417081200,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Seery.

Unfortunately the trends in HIV diagnosis picture have not changed since last year.  Today we are calling for a new approach to this so that we can try to achieve the goals of having zero new infections and zero discrimination against people who are living with HIV in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The statistics that have been published clearly show that the trend is not good.  In 2005 we had 60 cases of new diagnoses of gay and bisexual men and this had moved up to 159 cases in 2013.  This week the figures for the first six months of 2014 were released.  Unfortunately they mirror those problems.  We have gone from 82 cases in the first six months of 2013 up to 94 in the first six months of 2014.  So there is a significant problem here.  Especially for gay and bisexual men this is an issue that needs real attention and needs a new set of thinking on how we engage with people and how we get people to engage on their own sexual health.  That is one of the key targets here.  Ultimately we want to empower people to make the right decisions for themselves.<\/p><p>  HIV is an easily preventable condition, as are many sexually transmitted infections.  However, we have to be able to equip people with the confidence and awareness they need so that they can engage with their own sexual health.  We need to do that, starting from the basis of being honest about sexual health.  Nobody looks forward to an encounter with a doctor, an NGO or anybody about their sexual health.  Nobody wakes up in the morning with a smile on their face, thinking, \"I'm having my syphilis test today\"; that is not how the world works.  Far too often our services are built on the idea that is how the world works with the notion that if we provide the service, of course, people will come to it.  In reality there are so many significant barriers - social and stigma barriers - to engaging on sexual health for the entire population.  A whole additional level goes in on top for LGBT people and in the case of HIV in particular for gay and bisexual men.<\/p><p>  In Ireland the most common point of call for people engaging with their health is with their GP at primary care.  However, based on the most up-to-date Irish research, 54% of LGBT people are not out to their doctors.  If they are not out to their GPs about their sexual orientation, then there is no chance they will be able to get to their next step, which is their sexual health in general and that is important information for their doctors to know.<\/p><p>  We have been working with the Irish College of General Practitioners and health-care providers in sexually transmitted infection clinics to build their capacity to understand, first, that they have LGBT patients who look like everybody else and, second, that those patients face significant additional barriers when engaging with health services.  Those themes represent a two-step approach.  We have to be able to build up the capacity of the service provider before telling the service user it is okay to proceed.  We have had a very positive relationship with the Irish College of General Practitioners.  We have a new set of guidelines there.  We are working with St. James's and the Mater hospitals to help equip doctors through training seminars, increasing their awareness that there are issues and that there are lesbian and gay patients in their clinics.<\/p><p>  Once we know of the barriers we need to ask how we can be inventive about trying to create a service that is easy for people to use based on the original principle that we know people would prefer not to use the service at all.  We need services that are convenient, accessible, inclusive and understanding of those challenges.  Ms Seery's rapid testing service in Cork addresses that fear of the long delay before the result.  Mr. Foley's home testing uses new technologies to get people to engage more on their sexual health, while at the same time building up the capacity of primary care to deliver effectively for their lesbian and gay patients and more specifically for their gay and bisexual men patients.<\/p><p>  We need strategies that are targeted and tailored, and that recognise that one size does not fit all the population, given that we are dealing with an issue that people are very reluctant to engage in.<\/p><p>  Mr. Goulding will talk more about this.  We need to get to a point where there is zero discrimination against people living with HIV.  It is very real and has not gone away.  Stigma still exists.  To anyone who believes it does not exist I would ask them, \"If you were diagnosed with HIV tomorrow, whom would you tell?\"  I am pretty sure the answer is \"Nobody\".  Would such people tell their boss, their friends or their family?  Why would they not tell them?  Regardless of whether we want to concede it, stigma is very real and Mr. Goulding will refer to that.<\/p><p>  Some key recommendations arise from this.  On testing, we need to develop programmes that are resourced and recognise that we need to make testing accessible in many different ways because of the significant barriers to sexual health engagement for everybody and the additional barriers for gay and bisexual men in particular.  As Ms Seery has said, this is important because the vast majority of HIV cases are passed on by people who do not know they have HIV.  So we need people to know their status, whether negative or positive.  There is peace of mind for those who realise they have a negative status.  In additional the quicker those with a positive status get into treatment the better it is for their long-term health outcomes.  So we want to drive in as many people as possible.<\/p><p>  There needs to be a new focus on stigma and we need to invest money to raise awareness with the general population.<\/p> <p>We all remember huge advertising campaigns about HIV when it was in the public consciousness but these no longer exist.  We are not unrealistic about budgetary requirements and they will not suddenly started to exist again, but we need to find ways to target messaging to raise awareness that HIV exists, that people live with it and that stigma is unacceptable.  The prevention messages must be equally targeted because within the HIV figures we can see the diagnosis age is getting younger and younger.  It has gone from 37 years in 2005 to 32 years now.  Part of the reason is this generation did not have exposure to the type of information and heavy-duty campaigning that was out there.<\/p><p> We want to sign off on the national sexual health strategy.  We know it is nearly completed, or ready to be signed off, but the quicker the better so we can start to implement it.  It needs tough implementation guidelines and real targets and goals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014112700004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tiernan Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417081800,"counter":1093,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.  I will focus on home testing and how it fits in as another component of making testing in general more accessible.  The key differential from other methods is the testing itself is taken away from the clinical setting and is conducted by the user in an environment of his or her choosing.  Home testing and remote testing targets two areas specifically.  In the first instance are people who are asymptomatic who do not present any clinical symptoms, which is quite a large proportion of the population.  Before and after seroconversion people with HIV are generally asymptomatic.  A total of 80% of women with chlamydia are asymptomatic all of the time.  Home testing also removes many of the traditional barriers and encourages people to engage emotionally.  People may be afraid of the testing process or going to a clinic in the first instance, or might have geographical restrictions by way of time or where they are located, such as in rural Ireland are various parts of the country.  It is about giving them access and ensuring they are provided with a solution.<br\/><i>Letsgetchecked.com<\/i>is a technology platform that facilitates the dissemination of testing  It sends testing equipment to a person in a secure fashion.  It also disseminates results after testing has taken place.  I will try to keep my explanation of how the process works as simple as possible.  Someone visits the online site and orders a test kit from a laboratory.  The laboratory dispatches the kit in discreet packaging to the address designated.  The testing or self sampling is conducted, for HIV it is a finger prick of blood dispensed into a vial, and returned to the laboratory for analysis.  The laboratory then runs the test and uploads the results directly to the user's profile.  This can all be conducted through a mobile telephone, tablet or desktop device and is accessible and convenient.  Anyone can do it at any point in time.<br\/>There is an issue with people who test positive for HIV.  It is not appropriate that such results are just send to someone's phone.  The project could have gone live much sooner than it did, but we engaged the public health system by way of Saint James's Hospital and private health centres.  If someone tests positive he or she is contacted by a nurse over the phone.  By way of a three-way conference facility the nurse puts the patient directly through to a clinic at either Saint James's Hospital or a private clinic in Dublin run by Professor Fiona Mulcahy, at which point our nurse will drop off the phone and the person is directly put into care.<br\/>People who are infected also need to be provided with actionable information which allows them make sensible decisions on how they receive treatment or care and how they act socially, whereby they have the knowledge to act responsibly by way of treatment and interaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014112700005#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Foley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417081800,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me back to speak about HIV stigma and discrimination.  The stigma and discrimination that comes along with HIV has a knock-on effect for those of us living with it.  It continues to ensure people living with HIV are marginalised.  In June 2006, I took a case to the Equality Authority against a health provider who refused to treat me because of my HIV-positive status.  He believed I needed to be treated by a specialist who worked specifically in HIV area.  I won a <i>prima facie<\/i>case in 2009, as the Equality Tribunal believed I had been treated differently to someone who was HIV-negative or someone whose HIV status was unknown.<br\/>Along with the decision in my favour recommendations were made at the tribunal, including that universal precautions should always be used when a health provider works with any patient.  Universal precautions assume every patient may have an infectious illness.  Exercising these precautions ensures every patient is protected and treated equally.  Another recommendation was that all health care staff should be educated and trained on HIV transmission.  From working with people living with HIV I can say these recommendations have not been put in place.  For many of us living with HIV the places where we experience HIV stigma and discrimination the most is with health care providers.  We are still given the last appointment of the day, in the belief this will lessen the chance of cross-infection from other patients.  This is the case with my chiropodist at present.<br\/>Many people living with HIV have not yet tested.  Many do not disclose their HIV status because of the stigma.  This needs to be taken into consideration by health care providers, who should use universal precautions.  Those of us living with HIV are also aware of nurses and doctors outside of HIV clinics who double-glove when dealing with us.  In HIV clinics they do not double-glove as they do not see us as infectious but this still happens today with other health providers.<br\/>Many health professionals feel the need to ask people living with HIV how they got it.  This question would not be asked of somebody else with a chronic illness.  Many health providers feel they have a right to know this personal information.  Positive Now works closely with Dublin AIDS Alliance staff, who will say that one of the most frequent questions they hear from those who are newly diagnosed is whether they know of a HIV-friendly dentist or GP.  These individuals learned before they became HIV-positive about the stigma which exists.  These questions are still being asked in 2014.  Why have the Equality Tribunal's recommendations not been implemented?  In June 2010 I dropped a case against the HSE asking it to enforce these recommendations.  The Government must help tackle HIV stigma and discrimination to improve the lives of people living with HIV.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014112700005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jimmy Goulding"},{"type":"speech","time":1417081800,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Goulding for his interesting proposal and testimony.

Some members have returned once again and they are welcome back.  I have listened to the delegation and have gone through the detail of the GLEN submission in advance.  In terms of the immediate actions needed, awareness and testing are the two critical focus points that I have picked up from the messages delivered.  <\/p><p>  In the table and chart of HIV diagnosis rates over the period 2004 to 2012 there are variations in total numbers.  The critical focus of this particular address is on men who have sex with men or MSM.  There has been a marked increased in that particular area in comparison with any of the other areas who have been and are at risk of infection.  Can Mr. Brady explain why there has been an increase?  There has been real public awareness for many years although it does not have the same public address it once had.  Is that a factor in the increase?  Has HIV slid off the table in terms of public consciousness?  I am anxious to understand why there has been an increase.  If the number was the hold at the earlier figures, as had been demonstrated in the table, there would have been a significant overall decrease just like in other areas.  There has been a marked rise in the graph depicting MSM.  <\/p><p>  In terms of media, addressing the most at risk community was mentioned.  As I listened to that comment and having read the report my thoughts were, and I could be wrong, media is an absolutely a component part of how one addresses the issue.  I am only trying to tease out this matter.  Are new young coming out people more at risk?  Is there an analysis of the chart figures in terms of profile?  It has been mentioned that the average age of HIV diagnosis has fallen from 37 years down to 32 years.  Has there been, over the same period, a significant increase in younger males who may not be, for any particular period, heavily exposed to a community of gay men?  Does that put them at risk?  How do we address the matter if we categorise a group?  It is wrong to section off a group but understand it is a component part.  Awareness must be in the round and across the whole of society in order to have the best possible prospect of making an impact.  I invite further comments from the delegation on the matter.<\/p><p>  In terms of home testing, I note that the text given to us states, \"[W]orking with GLEN and healthcare providers to develop good practice models for the delivery of home testing services\".  The term \"working to develop\" sounds very complicated but testing should be a straightforward and simple practice.  It should be part of life and a regular routine for any male involved in sex with males.  It is for their own personal good health and that of their friends.  I ask the delegation to develop what is meant by developing good practice.  What more needs to be done in terms of the use of the word develop?  Home testing strikes me as preferable to some other options and is the least personally challenging.  In addition, one has personal control of the situation, one has full knowledge and one then is informed as to how to proceed.  It does not necessarily mean the information belongs to somebody else, who may not have anything other than a relatively distant professional relationship, that is a practitioner or whatever is the case.  Home testing means one has control and is in charge.  <\/p><p>  I understand the case for targeted information and awareness.  However, there is a whole new generation and generations who were not exposed to the same wow factor and bombardment of awareness that people of my age experienced so many years ago.  Perhaps society needs that again.  Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014112700006#G00100","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1417082400,"counter":1097,"content":"<p>I shall pick up on the Deputy's last point and state that awareness raising is overdue.  Mr. Goulding spoke about the matter and I was saddened to hear  his experience.  We need a targeted awareness programme but we also need a broader awareness raising piece.  There is a generation that knows about HIV but there is another generation that is awakening which does not necessarily know about it.<\/p><p>  Today's presentation reminded me of another presentation here a few years ago by Comhairle na n&Oacute;g on the difficulty accessing sexual health services for young people generally, particularly for people who lived outside a city environment.  Comhairle na n&Oacute;g wanted to know where one could access very basic information about sexual health services and today's presentation feeds into a wider discussion on the matter.<\/p><p>  I was also surprised to read reports today that were published in the Irish Medical Journal.  It surveyed 1,112 of 14 to 16-year olds of which approximately 5% or 58 of them had worries about sexual orientation.  That number was broken down into 35 boys and 23 girls.  Let us remember that these are 14 to 17 year olds.  I was alarmed to read that findings of the survey which talked about higher levels of mental health difficulties, an increased prevalence of attempted suicide, physical assault, sexual assault and substance misuse.  The survey is on today's Ireland and not 30 years ago when we had campaigns and awareness.  It is almost 1 December 2014 but this cohort of 14 to 17 year olds still face immense challenges and there is no reason this should be the case.  I would welcome the views from the delegation on how to reduce victimisation.  How to do we ensure, when raising awareness, that we do not contribute or add to preconceived notions?  Those of us who are aware understand what the message behind an advertisement or an awareness raising campaign.  For those who are not aware a campaign can sometimes feed a preconception or notion.  I am interested in hearing what the delegation has to say on the matter.  As the Chairman knows, I must Chair a meeting and so must leave shortly but I shall stay as long as I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014112700006#G00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1417082400,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>I thank the panel for their very detailed presentations and all the information it has been given this morning.<\/p><p>  I wish to touch on a few items that were raised.  Ms Seery stated that over half of people are diagnosed late.  What is meant by \"diagnosed late\"?  It is important that we get clarification on the matter.  <\/p> <p>Mr. Brady referred to the need for a campaign.  How, in the delegates' view, should one be conducted, taking current financial restrictions into account?  Is there a particular cohort at whom a campaign should be targeted and how should the campaign be managed?  For example, should be it conducted through third level colleges, social media or particular organisations?  I am interested in hearing the delegates' views in this regard, given that they are the ones with experience of dealing with this issue.<br\/>It was stated that, according to <i>LetsGetChecked.com<\/i>, there were approximately 100,000 people living in Ireland with the infection, 25% of whom did not know they had it.  How can the organisations encourage greater awareness?  An Oireachtas colleague told me yesterday that he had received a telephone call from a person complaining about the number of non-Irish people living in Ireland, suggesting they were the cause of all our infection problems.  The tendency of Irish people to blame everybody else for their problems is amazing.  Based on the figures available, is it possible to provide a breakdown of the socioeconomic make-up of those with the infection, the number of Irish people who have travelled abroad and are infected and the number of people who have come here from abroad and are infected?  Are details available in that regard?  In terms of our tendency to blame everybody else for our problems, it is important that the correct information is placed in the public domain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014112700006#G00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417083000,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late attendance, but I was listening to the discussion on the monitor in my office.  <\/p><p>  I was once asked what was my favourite film, to which I replied without hesitation \"Philadelphia\" which starred Tom Hanks.  It was the first film I had seen that dealt with the issue of AIDS.  It brought home to me the reality of the rejection of people not alone in their employment but often also in their neighbourhoods and by their families.  For me, the film depicted how the human body broke down when people were infected and how because of this their bodies became offensive to others.<\/p><p>  Mr. Brady asked whom we would tell if we were diagnosed with HIV tomorrow.  The same question arises in regard to mental health issues.  Whether we like it, there is a stigma attached to mental illness.  I recall the impact of Princess Diana touching, hugging and kissing people infected with HIV, while others were running away from them fearing they would become infected by them.  This brought home to ordinary people the reality of how much we stigmatised others.  <\/p><p>  These days young people are well educated.  They are not stupid, yet they continue to take huge chances and risks in their sexual activity.  This applies across the board, not only to gay men and lesbians.  Will the delegates explain the reason for this?  It has been stated it is estimated that one in four people infected with HIV remains unaware of his or her condition, yet we have great services in place to deal with breast, bowel and prostrate cancer.  How do the organisations fund their awareness programmes?  What funding, if any, is provided by the Government?  If there was one recommendation the delegates would wish the committee to take on board, what would it be?  The committee meets many groups and makes many promises, half of which we do not get to keep.  When I leave the meeting, what is the one thing I, as a member of the committee, can do to help?  What is the main issue with which the delegates would task the committee which I hope we will be able to achieve?

It is a difficult one in which to make inroads.  However, inroads are being made, although there is a long way to go.<\/p><p>  There are many who say it is not possible to destigmatise a particular illness.  I refer to TB and how it was destigmatised, as also happened in the case of cancer which was known as the big \"C\".  Why cannot mental illness and HIV be destigmatised?  Have the organisations looked at the Government's plan, See Change, and considered addressing the destigmatising of HIV in a similar manner?  The former Minister of State, Mr. John Moloney, did a great deal of good work in this regard.  Destigmatisation of HIV is key.  <\/p><p>  I found Mr. Foley's presentation very interesting.  To be honest, I was unaware that home testing was available, even though I had been reading information from GLEN for many years.

People forget this, but it is simply amazing.  If anyone had predicted, even in 1989, that treatments routinely available within 15 years would be so good that, as far as we know, most patients with HIV infection would be actuarially restored to a normal life expectancy curve, rather than facing the uniform death sentence which applied heretofore, it would have been regarded as science fiction because medicine does not work like that.  This was an extraordinary achievement which involved brilliant science and good medicine.  The various activist groups had a lot to do with it and deserve great credit for pushing hard for increased investment in research at a time when it was regarded as a lower priority research undertaking.  People who have this virus need to know they have it because the treatment available is really good.  Not knowing that they have it poses substantial risks to their health.  One message that needs to go out is that testing is good.  People need to know their status not, as was the case in the 1980s, because of some societal warning that they should not be taking risks for somebody else's sake, although that is important, but for their own health.  There will be further advances and, obviously, it is hoped a vaccine will be found.<\/p><p> Key issues that will arise in the coming years include the right to confidentiality and insurance.  These are complicated issues which have to be dealt with differently now that we know people will survive with the disease.  All of the concerns about issues such as life insurance, mortgage protection insurance and health insurance need to be seen in a totally different light.  In the past somebody with an incurable disease such as Crohn's disease would not have faced the same strictures in respect of insurance and confidentiality compared to somebody with this disease.  We need to normalise our understanding of it.  It is another chronic illness such as rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy, diabetes or, increasingly, many forms of cancer.  It can be treated and people will live with it.  We need to develop structures in the health system, insurance market and our general attitudes to reflect this reality.<\/p><p> Somebody needs to sit down to write the wonderful story about how this disease was contained in a totally different way from what had been expected.  The original notion was that it would never be treatable and that a vaccine would instead have to be developed.  The outcome has been exactly the opposite.  It involved extraordinary work in the area of molecular biology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014112700007#H00500","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417083600,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the age profile of those affected.

There is no doubt that people of a certain age who did not grow up in the 1980s or 1990s simply do not have access to the massive public awareness campaigns pursued during those decades.

We advised on its development and also prepared a document with the Department of Education and Skills specifically aimed at helping teachers to provide a sexual education and the SPHE programme for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.  However, we know that it is not being taught universally, even though everybody who is 17 years old is in a classroom.  If we are discussing marketing and targeting awareness subject to budgetary constraints, we know where a lot of people are at any one moment.  We have a curriculum and have to have it taught.  <\/p><p>  We repeatedly come back to the issue of stigmatisation of sexual health.  People do not want to teach this subject for the same reason a person does not want to go to a doctor to discuss his or her sexual health.  I agree that mental health and sexual health are twins in terms of the stigma attached to them.  People are embarrassed to engage and this has a detrimental impact.  As Senator John Crown rightly noted, engaging is the best thing for individual health outcomes, as well as the other issues that arise from people not knowing their own status.  Education is key in building awareness.  Sexual health education is about giving people the capacity to assess own their sexual health.  Once they have confidence, knowledge and capacity, that is the biggest step.  It should not be the case that they have to go to a doctor every couple of months.  They should know how to take care of themselves and be able to make the make the best decisions for themselves.<\/p><p>  On risk, there is a process which we call \"othering\".  People underestimate their risk exposure.  HIV is a good example.  Everybody thinks it happens to somebody else.  Some think it happens to people from Africa.  Straight people think it happens to gay people and gay people think it happens to straight people.  The result is that nobody thinks it happens to anybody.  Younger people form one of the groups most at risk.  When it come to the nationality breakdown, the single largest group is Irish people and, within that cohort, young Irish men.  However, these are also the ones who think they are not exposed to risk because they consider themselves to be invincible.  They take the attitude that they know what somebody with HIV looks like.  They make the same presumptions about someone their own age as they make about themselves and, instantly, that othering process increases their exposure to risk.<\/p><p>  To respond to Senator Jillian van Turnhout's question, we know from Irish research that most people become aware of their sexual orientation by the age of 11 or 12 years.  The average age when someone comes out is 21 years.  In the intervening ten years people keep to themselves one of the most important things about who they are.  When we say \"coming out\", we are referring to the first time a person tells a close friend not to inform his or her entire class.  This is an area in which people are incredibly susceptible.  There is a good chance that a person under the age of 21 years who presents to a doctor is not out to anybody.  We have to ensure health care professionals understand they may be the first to be informed by the patient.  What can they do to create an environment that makes it easier and more likely to happen?<\/p><p>  On the issue of rapid and home testing, one of the reasons we have only started into this process is there has been considerable worry during the years about home testing and, for example, the circumstances in which a person might be if he or she was to test positive.  The safeguards being put in place are very good.  Our goal is to persuade people to normalise testing and engagement.  Sometimes we devise services for others instead of asking ourselves basic questions about what we would do.  Would I prefer to sit in a hospital for several hours or have a home testing kit?  When we ask ourselves that question, the answer is so obvious that we can design a system flowing from it.  Similarly, in respect of rapid testing, do I want to have to wait for ten days for a result when I can have it in 20 minutes?  We should be using all of the technologies available to us to build the widest array of services and break down the barriers in order that people will have pathways for engaging.<\/p><p>  Education is key not only at second level but also throughout life.  Not everybody is in secondary school.  However, we have a good curriculum and need to ensure it is taught in an inclusive way for all students in the classroom.<\/p> <p>That would be one of my key asks.  I am sure everybody else would have a key ask as well.  I hope that answers some questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014112700008#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tiernan Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417084200,"counter":1109,"content":"<p>I will respond to the question on the reason people still get HIV.  Contracting HIV is associated with risk.  People still have unplanned crisis pregnancies.  People have sex with others under the influence of alcohol and may not even remember whether they have had sex, let alone with whom they had it.  It is associated with the culture.<\/p><p>  For the person with HIV, there are issue around telling a sexual partner, does one tell him on the first date or at what stage does one tell him?  This is one of the issues that our counsellors deal with all the time.  For a person with HIV in the gay community, at what stage in a relationship does one tell the other person?  If one divulges one's secret and the relationship does not go anywhere, will he tell other people?  There is a significant issue around disclosure, whether people divulge their status or not.  All of this impacts on whether people have risky or safe sex.<\/p><p>  On the question of targeted information for men having sex with men, MSM, there is no one type of MSM.  Many men who have sex with men are in an almost married civil partnership or monogamous relationship and are not on the scene.  There are different scenes and what we in the Sexual Health Centre are doing to promote our rapid HIV testing is training advocates to be in all of the different scenes in order that wherever men are having sex, they will have access to somebody who will say to them that for their own health would it not be a good idea to go along and have a test.  We have to get people out there to interact with others.<\/p><p>  We published a very nice leaflet and distributed it all over the place.  Of the 520 people who have come to the Sexual Health Centre for their rapid HIV testing in the past two years, not a single person came because of the leaflet.

We are involved in outreach work with disadvantaged communities in Cork but we also are involved in schools.  The implementation of the SPHE programme in schools is patchy but I think there is a real role for organisations like ourselves to work in schools.  We would work in partnership with teachers.  Teachers are not necessarily the most appropriate people to talk to children about the risks associated with oral sex and how to have an orgasm.  These are the type of questions that people ask us.  That is what people want to know.  They need to know the biological facts but they have other questions. The major concept that we need to promote is that it is quite easy to talk about sex.

When one's CD4 count gets to a certain level, one gets treatment.  If it falls below that level, the treatment is not quite as effective and one may have developed symptoms.  Some people are picked up and are diagnosed by the time they already have developed symptoms.  The reason we must get people to test early is because the treatment is much more effective at that point.  In respect of where people are born, 41% were born in Ireland and 50% were born abroad.

There, they have targeted chlamydia as an area, with much success, and have tried to provide women under the age of 25 with home test kits.  Using that as a benchmark, as well as their best practice models, I tried to create a more holistic approach that covered the various infections.  However, approximately six months ago, I reached a point at which I realised their system, in which results were delivered via text message, was not suitable, in particular with regard to infections such as HIV.  Obviously, there are massive privacy, confidentiality and even emotional issues and there is a responsibility on me or the company relaying these messages that they would not come in a such a format.  It was at that point it became clear that it would be necessary to integrate existing systems and processes such as hospital infrastructure and whatnot to provide clear pathways to care in order that someone who tested positive would be put straight into the right environment and would not be left to deal with this alone.  In addition, the fact that this is an online entity meant that while it started off operating solely within Ireland, there has also been uptake in the United Kingdom.  For that reason, I was obliged to find similar pathways by way of the Terence Higgins Trust, which is the main HIV and AIDS charity in the United Kingdom, and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, which is the number one foundation hospital in London, to try to emulate the work we are doing here in St. James's Hospital.  This pretty much is what slowed down the entire process and it is only now that we are really at a point to make noise about it and bring it to people's attention.<\/p><p>  In response to Senator Colm Burke, the reference to Ireland and 100,000 people is a misprint.

I stated that I believe young people are better educated and there are more young people in school than ever was the case previously.  My point was that I could not understand why this was happening, but obviously the reason is the system in school does not work.  I have raised the programme that is being run in schools at this joint committee.  Teachers must teach their own classes sex education and it does not work.  I have spoken to many teachers and it does not work.  It is very difficult for young teachers to be asked to conduct an SPHE session in which they are talking to those children to whom they probably taught maths or English an hour earlier.  The feedback I have been getting from teachers is that this is a real difficulty for them.  While I have raised this issue here, I have spoken to a few teachers about it and there should be a system within the education system whereby teachers are specifically identified who are not obliged to teach the programme within their own schools but can teach it in neighbouring areas or communities.  Consequently, they would not be facing the young people they know, because Mr. Goulding is correct and I agree with him.  I have two teenagers at home and this is not a taboo subject in our house.  We talk about it freely enough but the point is that when one is in a classroom and one is a young teacher and one is being asked to talk about people's private experience, it is very difficult for young people to open up.  One of the biggest problems is the need to consider a system that allows teachers or specific people to travel around schools and teach this programme.<\/p><p>  A long time ago, I raised at this joint committee the possibility of having a mobile bus that would travel to all schools - similar to a mobile library, although one could not borrow a book - aboard which people's sexuality and other health issues would be discussed.  While people laughed at that suggestion, one of the best innovations in the country has been the introduction of mobile clinics.  When they were introduced, they were great for helping people who had drug addictions.  Similarly, while I am unsure whether it is there every evening, I frequently pass a mobile clinic on St. Stephen's Green that deals with those who are homeless.  They can step onto the bus from time to time if they have a complaint.  It is a great facility to have and I reiterate young people should be allowed the opportunity to be able to express themselves in the classroom, albeit not necessarily with Mr. Brady or Mr. Foley, because they had taught those pupils maths ten minutes earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014112700010#L01300","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417084800,"counter":1129,"content":"<p>That is a good point.<\/p> <p>We know that education works and equips people to make the best decisions for their lives and sexual health.  We also now know there is a barrier to delivering that education for multiple reasons, including some of the ones the committee has correctly pointed out.  A proper strategic response is required that accepts that we have a problem and need to deliver education.  We need to determine the layers and approaches that can be used to make sure we can deliver it everywhere.  The approach in one school might be different from that in another.  An NGO presence might visit some schools.  Teachers who are trained might travel.  There is a requirement to recognise that there needs to be a strategic response to the problem.  That is the most important thing, in terms of strategy, to come from this side.<\/p><p> I wish to refer to some figures.

We will make our programmes available all over the country.  We can train people.  We are making our Sexual Times available all over the country because people think it is a good resource.  We have to share information.<\/p><p>  In regard to the education of young people, one does not have to be a teacher.  Some of our staff have backgrounds in nursing or teaching and some do not.  The most important things are the ability to connect with young people and being comfortable talking about sex.  Education does not just take place in school; it also takes place in the home and the broader community and on the Internet.  Many young people now think that nobody has pubic hair - I apologise for mentioning pubic hair in the Oireachtas but it is important that we know this - because they are getting their education from porn.<\/p><p>  We have to be able to talk to people.  It does not matter how much one knows about sex.  The actual information one gets about sex is not rocket science.  The ability to talk is what is important.  Transition year is wonderful for giving people confidence and competence in terms of understanding where they are coming from.  The biggest bonuses for sexual health education is developing good self-esteem and confidence.  One will not let anybody lead one astray if one values oneself.  Young people need good general health education and specific sexual health education so that nobody can say if one has sex standing up, one is all right, which is one of the myths out there.  They are important in enabling people to stand up for themselves and determine what information is correct or incorrect.<\/p><p>  We are a small country.  We all know each other.  We work well together.  We have made major changes over the years.  I have every confidence that we will continue to do so.  In answer to the question about the heterosexual population, it is the most difficult one in some ways.  We do not know who they are.  We have people who get a late diagnosis, some of whom are from different countries and are terrified of taking a test because they are afraid they will be sent back to their own country.  It is a very diverse population and that is why we need very good health intelligence to break down the populations and be constantly alert about where we can go to make sure people get information about testing.  Rapid HIV testing uses home testing in an organisation so that it is coupled with counselling.  We are operating from the same page.
