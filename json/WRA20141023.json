The Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan sets out a vision of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore renewable energy resource contributing to economic development and sustainable growth, and generating jobs for our citizens. The Plan highlights the importance of coherent policy, planning and regulation, managed in an integrated and collaborative manner.    To coordinate support across Government, the Offshore Renewable Energy Steering Group has been established with relevant Government departments and agencies overseeing the implementation of the plan, focussing on three main areas namely the Environment, Infrastructure and Job Creation. In addition, the Steering Group will hold plenary sessions with external stakeholders annually.<\/p><p>  The ocean energy sector is at the pre-commercial stage. A range of policies is required to support developers in bringing their devices from prototype to full scale commercial viability. Exchequer support for ocean research, development and demonstration has been provided to the sector in recent years and is being increased under the OREDP. My Department&rsquo;s multi-annual ocean energy development budget was increased by &euro;16.8 million, covering the period 2013 to 2016, and brought the total cumulative funding to &euro;26.3 million. This funding will support the development of the test sites in counties Mayo, Galway and Cork, the Integrated Maritime Energy Resource Cluster at Ringaskiddy, and the Prototype Development Fund operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Options for an additional &euro;30 million capital funding in the years 2016 to 2018 are being discussed cross-departmentally. T his funding is expected to facilitate innovative projects, like the ESB led Westwave project, that can meet certain compliance criteria. <\/p><p>  Finally, I should highlight that the OREDP further proposes, subject to State Aid clearance from the European Commission and further Government approval, an initial market support scheme for wave and tidal energy from 2016, limited to 30MW, to unlock the economic growth and job creation opportunities offered by ocean energy development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300042#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postcode Implementation","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300042#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[40393\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300042#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding the roll-out of the Eircode postcode system.","asker":"1083","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>Since the contract to deliver the project was signed with Capita in December 2013, considerable progress has been made.

There are a number of publicly available reports that compare the costs of electricity generation at an aggregate level from the various sources of energy including a 2010 report titled &ldquo;Low Carbon Generation Options for the All Island Market&rdquo; which is available on the EirGrid website. More recently, an interim report, prepared for the European Commission, titled \"Subsidies and costs of EU energy\" was published by the Commission last week. The interim report evaluates the subsidies and levelised costs of various renewable technologies in aggregate across European Member States and highlights the cost effectiveness of onshore wind energy.    The primary support mechanism for renewable electricity from a range of renewable sources is through the Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff schemes. These REFIT schemes are designed to provide renewable electricity generators with the certainty required to finance their projects. Based around Power Purchase Agreements between generators and electricity suppliers, REFIT schemes assure a minimum price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a defined period. Specifically, depending on the size of a wind project the REFIT tariff is either &euro;69.581 or &euro;72.023 per megawatt hour of electricity exported to the grid. The costs associated with the REFIT schemes are payable from the Public Service Obligation fund, which is raised by a levy on all electricity consumers. Analysis underpinning these rates would have been undertaken and submitted with the application to the European Commission for State Aid approval. <\/p><p>Furthermore, tax relief is available on capital investment in wind generation assets under Section 486B of the Tax Consolidation Act and under the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme. An Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme also allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying renewable energy generation technologies against their tax liabilities in Year 1 rather than over a more prolonged period of years, thus aiding cash flow.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300042#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Incentives","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300042#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[40170\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300042#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding the amount of grant aid paid by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to Irish wave energy companies by company; the type of wave energy converter proposed in each case; and the technical readiness level of each company before and after the grant aid.","asker":"1192","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>Wave and tidal energy technology is still at the Research, Development and Demonstration stage globally.

In March 2008, an advisory group was established to review the existing legislative framework regarding the public interest aspects of media mergers in Ireland. The Group&rsquo;s recommendations were incorporated in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014. One key change was the passing of responsibility for the Media Mergers process from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to me in my capacity as the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The Act enhances our ability to pursue the public interest in protecting media pluralism. It provides for a determination to be made on whether a proposed media merger should be permitted or not based on its effect on the plurality of media in the State and on its implications on the concentration of ownership in media. It conveys further powers on the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to assist in a thorough &lsquo;Phase 2&rsquo; of a proposed merger, if so requested, and gives the BAI further responsibilities to conduct and publish ongoing research into media pluralism in the State.Taken together with our long standing support for public service broadcasting, I am confident that we have a robust and effective set of measures in place to support and encourage a plural and diverse media.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300044#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Services","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300044#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[40168\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300044#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will amend the current postal services Acts to introduce a public service obligation on An Post to maintain a minimum level of service to rural communities by providing a geographical spread of sub post offices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 107 of 4 June 2014.

It is a condition for receipt of FIS that the claimant must have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them.  A qualified child is one under the age of 18 or one between the ages of 18 and 22 who is attending full-time education by day.  Entitlement to FIS is renewed each year on the anniversary of the original claim.<\/p><p>  Once the appropriate rate of FIS due is determined it generally continues to be payable at that same rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment.  The two principal exceptions to this are where there is an additional qualified child in the family or (with effect from July 2013) where payment of One-parent Family (OFP) ceases due to the youngest child reaching the OFP age threshold.  The person concerned was originally awarded FIS from October 2008.  Accordingly, her 52 week entitlement period ran from October to October each year.  She ceased to claim OFP in June 2013 for a reason other than her youngest child reaching the OFP age threshold.  This was during her 52 week entitlement period from October 2013 to October 2014.  She was not entitled to an increase in her FIS entitlement at that time.

It is levied on electricity customers only. There is no PSO levy associated with gas bills. The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by PSO funded producers. The PSO levy is vital to enable Ireland to meet its 2020 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources further informs me that the biggest driver for the levy rise for this year is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is currently estimated to be around 10% lower than last year.  This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover their allowed costs.  The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by lower international gas prices in evidence since spring 2014.  This drives up the proposed PSO levy.  However, if these lower gas and wholesale prices are sustained, it will reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay.

Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low tax commodity to petrol to defraud motorists and the State. The numbers of complaints of this kind received by Revenue in counties Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Leitrim in the period since July 2014 is 31, comprised of 1 in July, 7 in August, 17 in September and 6 to 21 October 2014. An analysis of the complaints on a county basis is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Complaints Received in Relation to Petrol Stretching <\/th><th>#<\/th><th>#<\/th><th>#<\/th><th>#<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>July <\/td><td>August <\/td><td>September <\/td><td>October <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo <\/td><td>0<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon <\/td><td>0<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway <\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim <\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><\/table>Revenue investigates all complaints of this kind and fuel samples are taken from filling stations and referred to the State Laboratory for analysis where the investigating officers have reason to suspect excise fraud. To date 48 premises nationwide have been tested with samples referred to the State Laboratory.<br\/><br\/>Conclusive results have been received in one case which confirms contamination through the presence of kerosene and Revenue are considering the possibility of prosecution in this case.\u00a0 Final results are awaited in respect of the other samples referred for analysis.\u00a0 It is understood the State Laboratory is reviewing its existing procedures with a view to expediting testing which, I am informed is quite complex.<br\/><br\/>Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102 (1A) of the Finance Act 1999. The Deputies can be assured that, if Revenue's investigations and the analysis of fuel samples indicate the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.<br\/><br\/>I understand also that Revenue has been in contact with the motor and fuel trades about the reported problems. Cooperation with the fuel trade has been an important element in the successful work undertaken in recent years to combat fuel fraud, and can play a key role in addressing any further issues that come to light. It is essential, in particular, that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific traders are shifting some of their sourcing to illegal fuel.<br\/><br\/>Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol, and should report any suspicions to Revenue. Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically dealing with the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices including the adulteration of fuel.<br\/><br\/>The first point of contact for motorists whose vehicles may have been affected should be their motor insurance companies. Persons affected should also contact the point of purchase of the fuel. If they remain unsatisfied, they may have recourse to civil remedies and should seek legal advice.<br\/><br\/>All trading entities are obliged to ensure that they are correctly registered for all taxes as required by legislation. In addition, a person engaged in the sale of petrol or diesel is required to hold an auto fuel trader's licence or a marked fuel trader's licence. Revenue enforces this licensing requirement rigorously and also acts to ensure that businesses of this kind are conducted in accordance with licence requirements. Action is taken in any case where unlicensed trading, or failure to comply with a licence's terms and conditions, is encountered. In the period from 2011 to date, more than 130 filling stations were closed, mainly for breaches of licensing conditions.<br\/><br\/>In summary an extensive range of new measure has been introduced over recent years to tackle fuel fraud, including enhanced supply chain controls and the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker. Key measures include the following:<br\/><br\/>- The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of the fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market;<br\/><br\/>- A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering;<br\/><br\/>- New requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure data are available to assist in supply chain analysis;<br\/><br\/>- New supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013 following \u00a0significant investment in new IT systems. These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.\u00a0 Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary, and <br\/><br\/>- An intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the measures implemented to date, Revenue has, in partnership with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK identified a more effective fuel marker and it is expected that a new marker will be introduced in both jurisdictions early in 2015 following consultation with the oil industry and other stakeholders.<br\/><br\/>To support further the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax. This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying rebated fuel recklessly to dubious customers and will provide a further disincentive to such activity. Revenue has published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.  I am committed to providing new measures to further assist Revenue in its work against fuel fraud should it be required.<br\/><br\/>I am advised also that the Revenue Commissioners work in close cooperation with other enforcement authorities, in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland, to combat this all-island problem. The Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, which includes representatives of the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other relevant organisations, was established to facilitate this cooperation, and has proven effective in supporting the identification and targeting of the organised crime gangs, many of whom have links to paramilitaries and former paramilitaries, that are responsible for the bulk of fuel fraud.

To date no individuals have been charged or files forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are continuing to investigate the complaints and are liaising with the injured parties. Furthermore, contact has also been made with the Revenue's Customs Service who have arranged to have fuel samples analysed for contaminants. <br\/><br\/>As the Deputy will appreciate, petrol stretching is a matter of serious concern because of the risks to the Exchequer, the threat to legitimate businesses and the damage that can be caused to the vehicles of unsuspecting purchasers of adulterated fuel. Under Section 102 of the Finance Act 1999, it is an offence to sell and\/or deliver oil on which Mineral Oil Tax at the appropriate rate has not been paid. <br\/><br\/>I am informed  that in the normal course of work  Revenue's enforcement staff take samples of fuel, which are sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis, from mineral oil suppliers, including filling stations, to ensure compliance with mineral oil regulations. If the results of the analysis reveals the presence of any illegal stretching agents, the Revenue Commissioners will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. <br\/><br\/>I am further advised that Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and are confident that, with this co-operation and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully. In this regard it is essential that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or &quot;stretched&quot; fuel. <br\/><br\/>In addition, motorists themselves should take care with regard to their source of petrol and report any suspicions concerning adulterated fuel which may have damaged their engines to Revenue who will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. In that regard Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website at www.revenue.ie specifically on the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices such as petrol stretching. <br\/><br\/><b>Number of complaints of petrol stretching <\/b><br\/><br\/><b>Garda Divisions of Mayo, Roscommon\/Longford, Galway &amp;amp; Sligo\/Leitrim <\/b><br\/><br\/><b>July-October (to date) 2014<\/b><br\/><br\/><b><i>Table 1- Mayo Garda Division<\/i><\/b><table><tr><th>Month <\/th><th>Claremorris Garda District <\/th><th>Ballina Garda<br \/><br \/>District <\/th><th>Westport Garda<br \/><br \/>District <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>July <\/td><td>9<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September <\/td><td>85<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October (as at 21 October) <\/td><td>37<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td>133<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/><b><i>Table 2- Roscommon\/Longford Garda Division<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><table><tr><th>Month <\/th><th>Roscommon Garda District <\/th><th>Castlerea Garda District <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>July <\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August <\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September <\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October (as at 21 October)<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td>5<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/><b><i>Table 3- Galway Garda Division<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><table><tr><th>Month <\/th><th>Loughrea Garda District <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>July <\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August <\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October (as at 21 October)<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td>4<br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/><b><i>Sligo\/Leitrim Division <\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>There were no complaints of petrol stretching made to An Garda Sioch&aacute;na in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Sligo\/Leitrim Division during the period in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300055#WRO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300055#WRO00550"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[40792\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300055#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to reintroduce operation freeflow this year in view of heavy traffic in the city centre and budget increases; the average cost over three years when it was operational; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":292,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that 'Operation Open City' replaced 'Operation Freeflow' with effect from 2012 and is due to commence in the Dublin Metropolitan Region on 7 December, 2014.

Creditors were not offering debt restructuring deals to people struggling with debt, even at the informal level, before the Insolvency Service opened its doors. Now they are. That is a key change.  <br\/><br\/>The uptake of the new formal insolvency solutions provided under the Personal Insolvency Act has, so far, been substantially slower than expected. This is a matter of concern, but it is one which ISI has fully acknowledged and is taking steps to address. <br\/><br\/>Recent qualitative research undertaken for ISI has confirmed three important obstacles to the uptake of insolvency measures. Firstly, up-front charges for insolvency and bankruptcy seem to be a barrier in practice in the Irish context, even though they are largely equivalent to those charged in other jurisdictions. Secondly, it would appear that many people are struggling to pay their debts unaided, and feel ashamed - which, of course, they should not - to seek an arrangement of any kind. Thirdly, people stressed by serious debt problems easily become isolated from mainstream media, and many have not been aware that insolvency solutions can help them. <br\/><br\/>I have just approved a package of immediate, concrete measures to address these barriers. Regarding the costs barrier, I have agreed to waive all fees previously payable to either the ISI or the courts by a debtor who applies for any of the debt solutions available under the Personal Insolvency Act &ndash; a Personal Insolvency Arrangement, a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Debt Relief Notice. This waiver was announced earlier this month by ISI, and  takes effect until the end of 2015, when it will be reviewed. <br\/><br\/>ISI has also announced that for the same period, it will provide a contribution of 750 euro to defray the cost of a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, if a reasonable insolvency proposal by a debtor is refused by creditors.  The debtor should not be faced with a bill arising from the creditor's refusal in this situation.<br\/><br\/>I hope to shortly be in a position to also announce reductions in bankruptcy costs.<br\/><br\/>As regards  the information barriers, ISI has just launched a targeted nationwide information campaign which will run in a series of locations around the country, using townhall meetings and  local media. It is designed to reach deeply indebted households more effectively, to directly address their concerns and to demonstrate through personal testimony that the Insolvency Act remedies are available and are working to help people out of their difficulties. <br\/><br\/>The initial indications are that these practical measures are already making a substantial difference, and my Department and ISI will continue to assess their impact.  <br\/><br\/>More broadly, I continue to keep all aspects of the personal insolvency legislation under careful ongoing review. The <i>Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 <\/i>provides, in particular, for the completion of a review of the operation of the Insolvency Service by the end of this year, to ensure that the Service has the powers needed to support families willing to work their way through their debt problems. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300055#WRO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300055#WRO00950"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[40831\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300055#WRO01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding residency status in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Meath; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned, together with other family members referred to by the Deputy, are the subject of Deportation Orders and therefore have no entitlement to residency in the State.<\/p><p>  Representations were received from the persons' legal representative, pursuant to Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), to revoke the Deportation Orders.

The total number of cases by 17 October in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is 9191, with 4546 deaths.  The WHO officially declared the outbreak in Senegal over on 17 October, and the outbreak in Nigeria over on 20 October.<br\/><br\/>The European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) concluded that the risk of a case in the EU is considered to be low in its latest risk assessment. Environmental conditions in Ireland do not support the natural sources or vectors of Ebola.  Consequently, the risk of transmission in Ireland is considered very low.<br\/><br\/>The EU Decision No 1082\/2013\/EU on serious cross-border threats to health, agreed under the Irish Presidency, provides a coherent framework for tackling all serious cross-border public health threats.  It addresses three main areas:<br\/><br\/>- preparedness and response planning;<br\/><br\/>- risk monitoring and assessment; and <br\/><br\/>- risk management and crisis communication.<br\/><br\/>The EU response to the health issues raised by the outbreak is being coordinated through the EU Health Security Committee which consists of representatives of the 28 Member States and the Commission.  The Committee has held a number of audio conferences on Ebola since the outbreak began.  The latest was held this week, with another meeting scheduled for next week.<br\/><br\/>These meetings have focused on:<br\/><br\/>- preparedness in Member States,<br\/><br\/>- coordination of the response amongst Member States,<br\/><br\/>- support to affected countries, and<br\/><br\/>- repatriation of EU nationals. <br\/><br\/>The National Public Health Emergency Team is the forum for coordinating the response between the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive during the planning and response phases of a public health emergency.  It has met a number of times in recent weeks to coordinate preparedness in the Irish health services and will meet weekly to review progress and coordinate the response to any cases in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The Management of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers in Ireland (VHF) is the national guideline for the management of any case of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers, including Ebola, in Ireland.  They were published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) in 2012.  Parts of this guidance have been updated in light of the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa.  The key elements to the guidelines include:<br\/><br\/>- the need for vigilance in considering the possibility of VHF in a person with a fever who has recently returned (within 21 days) from travel to an endemic area,<br\/><br\/>- the institution of appropriate infection control measures if a case is suspected,<br\/><br\/>- rapid testing and diagnosis of the case, and<br\/><br\/>- the management of his\/her contacts.<br\/><br\/>Given appropriate infection control measures, an outbreak with extensive community transmission is extremely unlikely. <br\/><br\/>The HPSC have produced specific information for travellers and people who have returned recently form affected areas. This includes specific information for humanitarian workers who may wish to volunteer to provide their services in the affected countries.<br\/><br\/>Advice for airport and port managers that had been developed was circulated to all relevant stakeholders.  This information was posted on the HPSC website.  The guidance document, <i>Update for Airport Managers and Airlines on Ebola Virus Disease<\/i>was posted on 22 August 2014 and the guidance document <i>Update for Port Managers and Ferry Companies on Ebola Virus Disease<\/i>was posted on 5 September 2014.  Posters (in English, French and Irish) - <i>Returning from West Africa? Important information about Ebola<\/i>&ndash; were printed and distributed to all airports and the main designated seaports.  They have been placed in prominent positions in full line of sight of all arriving passengers and crews in the arrivals areas of these locations.  <br\/><br\/>The health sector response is the major element of Ireland&rsquo;s national Ebola preparedness.  Firstly, it provides the expert advice and guidance to other Departments and, secondly, it puts in place the specific arrangements for an appropriate public health and clinical response to any case that might arise in this country. The HSE has established a cross directorate group to fast track training of front line health care staff and this group is developing a plan to do so. In addition, the Acute Hospitals Directorate has established an Ebola response management group to increase preparedness across all hospitals.<br\/><br\/>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has provided extensive information for hospital clinicians, general practitioners and other healthcare workers to enable rapid identification and management of suspected Ebola cases. Healthcare workers in the National Isolation Unit and hospitals around the country have received information and advice on identification and management of Ebola patients.  There is also extensive guidance relating to infection prevention and control which clearly describes the steps that staff must take to ensure that they protect themselves and other patients in the event of the presentation of a case or suspected case of Ebola.  Two information sessions on Ebola and relevant guidance will take place this week and representatives of the National Isolation Unit will also attend to answer any queries that hospitals may have.<br\/><br\/>The National Isolation Unit located at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, is the national referral centre for high risk suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola. The self-contained unit has 12 beds and is designed to admit, isolate and treat patients suspected or diagnosed with highly infectious diseases.  Staff in the unit have received specific training in the use of the appropriate distributed Personal Protective Equipment to be used in the management of a suspected Ebola patient.<br\/><br\/>In Ireland, all diagnostic tests for Ebola will be carried out in the BioSafety Level 3 facility at the National Virus Reference Laboratory in Dublin.  Testing is only carried out with prior consultation with the laboratory, who will provide advice on the packaging and transfer of specimens.<br\/><br\/>Airport screening been the subject of extensive discussion at EU level. At recent meeting of the EU Health Security Committee, a number of options for inward screening at airports for Ebola were discussed. It remains the view, based on advices from ECDC, that it is far more effective to support the implementation of exit screening in affected countries. However, it was noted that the provision of clear information to passengers from affected countries, particularly in relation to symptoms and how to access health care, are important measures in preventing the spread of the disease.  A number of countries have recently introduced entry screening in their airports. In all cases this has been targeted at passengers who have recently travelled from the affected countries. The scientific evidence does not support the introduction of airport screening for passengers arriving in Irish airports at this time.<br\/><br\/>All elements of the Irish response to date are based on best practice and take account of national and international best practice, and will be reviewed when new information becomes available as the situation evolves. The Department continues to work closely with the HSE, other government departments, the WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU Commission, Member States and other partners to coordinate measures to tackle the Ebola epidemic and to protect Irish citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300059#WRS00600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Delays","counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300059#WRS00700"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[40716\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300059#WRS00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a child (details supplied) in County Kildare will receive a hospital appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":373,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300059#WRS00900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Inspections","counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300059#WRS01000"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[40719\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300059#WRS01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on reports of difficulties at Tallaght hospital identified at two unannounced visits by the Health Information and Quality Authority; if he will discuss actions to be taken with Tallaght hospital board and management; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":376,"content":"<p>Since late 2012, the Health Information and Quality Authority has been carrying out a monitoring programme against the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) in hospitals throughout the country.

The Regulations have been amended on a number of occasions since 2005, most recently by the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 2011, which came into effect on 23 July 2011.  <\/p><p>  Long-stay charges for in-patient services only apply to the further provision of in-patient services to persons who have already received at least 30 days of in-patient services during the immediately preceding 12-month period.  Accordingly, many respite episodes would not attract any charge.  <\/p><p>  The Regulations made under the Act provide for two different classes of charges (in respect of the maintenance element of the in-patient services provided):<\/p><p>  -  Class 1- charges for those receiving in-patient services on premises where 24 hour nursing care is provided are based on income, subject to a current maximum of &euro;175 per week for a person whose income is &euro;208 or any greater amount) and<\/p><p>  -  Class 2 - charges for those receiving in-patient services on premises where 24 hour nursing care is not provided are based on income, subject to a current maximum of &euro;130 per week for a person whose income is &euro;194 or any greater amount).<\/p><p>  The charges are structured to ensure that those paying them retain a minimum income for personal use i.e. at least &euro;33 per week for those paying Class 1 rates and at least &euro;64 per week for those paying Class 2 rates.<\/p><p>  Section 53(4) of the Health Act 1970 provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed on a person in order to avoid undue financial hardship to that person (including having regard to whether or not the person has dependants). To assist in the fair application of the provisions of the Act and the related Regulations, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the determination and levying of charges for in-patient services, which include the need to have regard to the income of the person, the provisions of the Regulations and the person's individual circumstances and those of his or her dependants. These guidelines ensure that the applicable level of charge is determined taking account of each service user's income and necessary outgoings while receiving care, including reasonable regular financial commitments, thereby avoiding any unfair burden on the service user or his\/her dependants.<\/p><p>  On provision of full details in relation to the person concerned, the HSE should be in a position to review the individual circumstances and advise as to the appropriate charges, and the waiver or reduction, if any, applicable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300060#WRT00500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Delays","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300060#WRT00550"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[40761\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300060#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cavan has been waiting since March 2014 for his medical card application to be processed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"972","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":395,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

During the process, Ireland recommended that Pakistan take all appropriate measures to combat and prevent discrimination against religious and other minority groups, including by removing educational material which could serve to perpetuate discrimination.<br\/><br\/>At EU level, freedom of religion or belief and freedom of opinion and expression plays a central role in the EU&rsquo;s dialogue with Pakistan.  The High Representative for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, Catherine Ashton has expressed her concerns at the judgment, and others like it, on numerous occasions, and has called on Pakistan to respect human rights as guaranteed under international conventions.<br\/><br\/>In June 2014, the EU issued a Declaration on violence against women in Pakistan, expressing deep concern at the wide-spread violence perpetrated against women there.<br\/><br\/>The fifth meeting of the EU-Pakistan Joint Commission, which reviews EU-Pakistan bilateral relations annually, met in Islamabad on 24 June 2014. On human rights, the EU, while acknowledging efforts of the Government of Pakistan to strengthen human rights infrastructure in the country, expressed its concern on a number of issues including freedom of the media, freedom of religion and belief and the situation of women.<br\/><br\/>On 18 October last, a spokesperson for the European External Action Service expressed sadness and deep concern at the High Court decision to uphold this person&rsquo;s conviction, and called on Pakistan to ensure for all its citizens, full respect of human rights as guaranteed by international conventions to which it is party. The spokesperson further noted that the EU considers the death penalty a cruel and inhumane punishment and expressed the hope that the verdict would be appealed to the Supreme Court and struck down swiftly.<br\/><br\/>Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>belief.  We are well aware of the vulnerable situation of persons belonging to religious minorities in Pakistan and will continue to raise this case and others bilaterally with the Pakistan Government as well as through the framework and mechanisms of the European Union and the United Nations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300062#WRV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":444,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300062#WRV01700"},{"type":"question","counter":445,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[40813\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300062#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the recent comments by the Ulster Unionist Party leader that he had assurances that the Irish Government would have no role in negotiations on internal Northern Ireland affairs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":446,"content":"<p>The British and Irish Governments convened the current talks in order to address a number of key issues that have badly impacted on the reconciliation agenda and on economic renewal in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  We convened these talks as co-guarantors of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.

Following the publication of these reports, my Department advised that it would commence the process of gathering information which would be required to develop the proposed new model, to allow its impact to be assessed, and to assess if, and from when, the model could be implemented.<\/p><p>  Part of this process involves the collection of information in relation to the social context of schools.  The Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a social context schools survey to assist the development of an educational profile of schools, which is currently underway.<\/p><p>  At all stages, there has been comprehensive consultation with education partners and stakeholders and through this consultation there was awareness and broad support for the proposed approach including the deployment of a survey.<\/p><p>  With regard to SNAs, my Departments Circular 0030\/2014 on the SNA scheme, sets out the role which professional reports play in supporting the SNA scheme.

Like other commercial semi-state bodies, pay models are negotiated between management and unions and are then subject to a ballot as necessary. This occurred in Ervia&rsquo;s case and the pay model was implemented in 2011.<br\/><br\/>This involves a competitive market based pay model, which offers market based pay ranges for all employees, including a pay at risk element called Performance Related Award (PRA). A pay freeze will remain in place until 2016 as this is a key element of reducing overall payroll costs within the Group. \u00a0As such, Irish Water does not pay increments or any form of automatic pay award; the pay model applied allows for part of salaries to be placed at risk and this element of pay is only earned subject to performance. Every individual in Irish Water has a clear set of objectives set for the year and a set of metrics against which performance is measured.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has indicated to my Department that the maximum PRA element of pay ranges from 2.75% to 15%. While I understand that the Ervia pay model allows for a further 4% performance-related award to be made in circumstances of exceptional performance, entirely at the discretion of the Board, I am assured by Ervia that the maximum percentages to be applied in Irish Water will be as set out in the range provided above. Furthermore, no decision has been made in relation to the payment of any PRAs in Irish Water at this time.<br\/><br\/>The Government will shortly consider proposals to establish a unified board arrangement for Ervia and Irish Water. One of the first actions that I will be asking the new Board to take will be to review the application and operation of the pay model outlined above in Irish Water, particularly in its start-up phase.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

However, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewables energy in our total energy requirement, and in improving energy efficiency. <\/p><p>  Since 1990 the share of high carbon content fuels in electricity generation, such as coal and oil, has been reducing with a corresponding rise in the relatively lower carbon natural gas, and zero carbon renewables. Imported electricity is also considered zero carbon from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective under the Kyoto Protocol as emissions are counted in the jurisdiction in which they are emitted. The carbon intensity of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity has dropped by 48% from 896 g CO2\/kWh in 1990 to 469 g CO2\/kWh in 2013. <\/p><p>  The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a target of meeting 16% of total energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. To meet this obligation Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewables. At the end of 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy came from renewable sources. The total contribution from renewable generation to gross electricity consumption in 2013 was 20.8%.<\/p><p>  Historically, hydro was the largest contributor to renewable electricity in Ireland. While the contribution from hydro has declined in percentage terms since 1990, electricity production from wind energy has increased to the point that it accounted for 81% of the renewable electricity generated in 2013. Electricity generated from biomass accounted for 9% of renewable electricity in 2013. Biomass consists of contributions from solid biomass, landfill gas, renewable portion of waste and other biogas. In 2013 wind, hydro and biomass generated electricity accounted for 16.5%, 2.6% and 1.7% respectively of Ireland&rsquo;s gross electricity consumption.<\/p><p>  Looking out to the period beyond 2020, it is clear that there is potential to increase the diversity of our renewable generation portfolio. To this end, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland in the period to 2030 of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources. The Strategic Environmental Assessment carried out for the OREDP found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300067#WRAA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":539,"content":"<p>Question No. 194 answered with Question No. 189.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corrib Gas Field","counter":541,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300068#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":542,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[40868\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300068#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when it is expected that product from the Corrib gas field is likely to become available to the national grid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":543,"content":"<p>Completion of the Corrib gas field development works, by the developer, is the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.

In addition to improving fuel efficiency, CHP can also, by using fuels from renewable sources, contribute to achieving Ireland's 2020 overall renewable energy target, through renewable electricity and renewable heat. Recognising this potential, the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) scheme is designed to support up to 180 MW of biomass-fuelled CHP. <\/p><p>  Additionally, all renewable electricity generating technologies can avail of Section 486B of the Tax Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 which allows an investor to claim the lesser of 50% of all capital expenditure (excluding lands) or &euro;9.525 million for a single project. Investment by a company or group under this scheme is capped at &euro;12.7 million per annum. <\/p><p>  Other tax-based support measures include the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) Scheme which allows individual investors to obtain income tax relief on investments in renewable energy in each tax year. This scheme supersedes the previous Business Expansion Scheme. It provides a minimum tax relief of 30% with an additional 11% accruing at the end of the third and final year if the business has expanded to employ a designated number of people (or if the investment was used for R&amp;amp;D). The scheme has an investment cap of &euro;750,000 and may thus be suited to small industrial renewable energy projects. A number of financial services companies offer EII Funds or portfolios to investors.<\/p><p>  An Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme also allows companies to offset the cost of investment in CHP against their tax liabilities in year one, rather than over a more prolonged period, thus aiding their cash flow.<\/p><p>  CHP is already deployed in Ireland and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has advised that the installed capacity at the end of 2013 was 334 MW (336 units) compared to 330 MW (325 units) in 2012. It has also advised that of the 336 units installed, 248 were reported as being operational and that the operational installed capacity increased by 2 MW, to 308 MW, in 2013 compared with 2012.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300068#WRBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Biofuel Obligation Scheme Targets","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300068#WRBB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[40879\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300068#WRBB01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which bioenergy reduction continues to be assisted with a view to achieving self-sufficiency in respect of energy sources in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1024"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[40881\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300068#WRBB01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which employment creation has been generated by the biofuel and bioenergy sectors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 203 together. <br\/><br\/>I recently published a Draft Bioenergy Plan which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website (<i><\/i>). The draft Plan identifies the opportunity for the sustainable development of Ireland's bioenergy resources and will be implemented through a number of policy and enabling actions. The draft Plan will undergo Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessments, including public consultation, which will inform the content of the finalised Plan. These assessment processes will commence shortly. <br\/><br\/>The draft Plan recommends the continuation of the REFIT schemes and the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, both of which provide a route to market for biomass. Furthermore, the analysis underpinning the Plan is that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector represents the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals. Therefore, the Plan also recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources and its introduction would further increase the demand for biomass. The RHI scheme, once designed, will require State Aid approval from the European Commission and further Government approval. It is proposed to have the scheme in place in 2016.<br\/><br\/>Although my Department does not hold figures on the number of jobs that have been created and supported in the bioenergy sector, the draft Plan recognises that meeting the demand for biomass from indigenous sources could deliver significant economic and employment benefits. Consequently, the draft Plan contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass. In this regard the key recommendations include: the continued support for the Afforestation Programme; the continuation of the Bioenergy Scheme for energy crops; and the establishment of Bioenergy Ireland, a joint venture between Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte. <br\/><br\/>In terms of developing new sources of biomass, the draft Plan provides that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will endeavour to optimise the availability of waste for energy and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will continue its support for innovative energy uses for animal by-products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300068#WRBB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":564,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300069#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":565,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[40880\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102300069#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which the family car is likely to become reliant on electricity as opposed to fossil fuels in the future; the extent to which the need has been quantified in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":566,"content":"<p>The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive sets all Member States a binding target that at least 10% of the energy used in the transport sector must come from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels with electric vehicles also making a smaller contribution.  In terms of supports for electric vehicles, the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme is in place to incentivise and support, through grants of up to &euro;5,000, the early deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  These grants are in addition to the VRT reliefs which apply to electric vehicles. <br\/><br\/>Additionally, the ESB is continuing to roll out both publicly accessible charging infrastructure and domestic charge points.  My Department understands that 892 public charge-points have now been installed nationally.  These include 67 DC fast chargers, most of which have been installed on major roads.  Additionally, there are 918 domestic\/commercial installations in place.<br\/><br\/>The extent to which electrics vehicles are adopted in the short-to-medium term will depend on a range of factors including,<i>inter alia<\/i>, the strength of the economy, the overall numbers of new cars being purchased, the cost of purchasing and running electric vehicles compared to fossil fuel comparators, and the number of different electric vehicle models available to purchase. There are signs that these factors are improving and in 2014 there has been an increase in electric vehicle purchases through the grant scheme compared to last year.  Furthermore, it is expected that the biggest technological developments in the sector will take place in battery and vehicle design and this will continue to address concerns regarding the battery range of electric vehicles.<br\/><br\/>Moving beyond 2020, negotiations are now well under way on the Climate and Energy Framework 2030 published by the European Commission in January of this year.  The proposals foresee significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and an increases in renewable energy across the EU.
