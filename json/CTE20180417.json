As the committee is aware from my correspondence, this opening statement will address the issue of recent revelations relating to the use of social media and its potential influence on previous and future elections and referenda.  As outlined by the Chair, I am joined this afternoon by assistant Data Protection Commissioner,  Ms Joanne Neary, who leads the Data Protection Commission's supervision function in relation to technology multinationals.  I am also joined by Mr. Graham Doyle, the head of communications at the Data Protection Commission, DPC.<\/p> <p>  I wish to start by briefly setting in context the convergence between the use of personal data in the digital or online environment and the objective of influencing the political behaviour of citizens.  As the committee is aware, data protection regulation is concerned with the enforcement of data subject rights and the supervision of those organisations who hold, use and control the personal data of individuals.  Relevant to the theme of these discussions, data protection law regulates, among other things, personal data processing in the context of online behavioural marketing of which political micro-targeting can be a subset.  The issues of personal data processing on the one hand and electoral matters on the other are distinct and separate from each other and my office has no role in regulating the core aspects of electoral activity, including advertising and canvassing activities, other than where personal data is deployed.  For example, the committee members may be aware that the DPC has previously issued guidance in the context of the last election on canvassing, data protection and electronic direct marketing and we are updating that guidance currently to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR.  Recent media coverage of the activity of Cambridge Analytica and its relationship with Facebook, however, means that these two areas of regulation may have been inadvertently conflated.<\/p> <p>  I will turn now to the issue of micro-targeting, which is central to today&rsquo;s discussions.  Micro-targeting is a type of processing of personal data where the personal data of an individual, for example, in a digital context this could be their online profile, is used to identify their interests and preferences across a whole range of issues, and to personalise that individual&rsquo;s online environment.  This is sometimes also referred to as online behavioural advertising.  This personalisation can be done, for example, by delivering particular content, like specific advertisements, news feeds and messages, in a particular sequence with the aim of influencing the individual&rsquo;s views, perceptions and ultimately their future choices, actions and behaviours.  Political micro-targeting is a particular form of micro-targeting which uses different methods of communications to interact with and ultimately influence prospective voters.  The data used to target and segment individuals may be demographic, geographic and-or behavioural in nature, in addition to richer sources of data gathered from the individuals themselves, such as information on their existing political views, personal opinions, lifestyle choices, and information indicative of personality types.  <\/p> <p>  Meanwhile, the objective of data protection law is to protect individuals, among other things, from the unfair processing of their personal data.  A key aspect of this fundamental fairness of processing issue is about transparency for individuals as to what information is collected on them, how it is used and who it will be shared with, so that individuals are positioned in a way that means they can actually control the use of their personal data in a meaningful way, for example, by opting not to provide information to a particular organisation in the first place.<\/p><p>As members are aware, recent media reports on the activities of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have brought into focus the question of whether big data analytics combined with micro-targeting capability for delivery on social media platforms are being utilised to influence political and electoral outcomes.  Big data refers to the practice of combining huge volumes of diversely sourced information, while big data analytics involves analysing these very large datasets using sophisticated algorithms - complex mathematical models - to identify patterns and trends with a view to informing decisions made on or in respect of individuals, such as deciding what subsets of individuals might be targeted with what selective material in an attempt to influence choices, preferences and behaviours towards a particular outcome.  Big data relies not only on the increasing ability of technology to support the collection and storage of large amounts of data but also on its ability to analyse, understand and take advantage of, in particular, the full value of data using these types of analytics applications.<br\/><br\/>While the focus of today&rsquo;s discussion is political micro-targeting in the digital or online environment, it may also occur in an offline or real-world context.  In any event, while the aim of online political micro-targeting is ultimately to influence an individual&rsquo;s thoughts or actions in the political sphere, it is recognised by academics and regulators that a possible outcome of political micro-targeting in particular is manipulation of individuals.  One of the core concerns with these sorts of micro-targeting activities in general is that the autonomy of individuals is potentially jeopardised because the ability to make choices is potentially being dictated by the deployment of the individual&rsquo;s information in ways that he or she does not know about, has not been told about and\/or does not understand.  This is likely because individuals have not been presented with full information in order to allow them to objectively assess the information with which they have been micro-targeted or because their circumstances are such that they simply are not capable of understanding the consequences for them of this type of processing.  I refer, for example, to circumstances where the individuals involved are vulnerable internet users such as children.  The potential adverse effects of political micro-targeting are amplified when one considers the ubiquity of social media and the amount of time spent on online platforms where political micro-targeting can occur.  The issue of actual manipulation of social media users can also be linked in certain circumstances to issues of &quot;fake news&quot; creation sometimes disseminated by bots or fake accounts.  Such latter matters fall outside the scope of data protection law.<br\/><br\/>I emphasise that with political micro-targeting, the concerns about manipulation of voters through such activities remain largely theoretical at this stage, as it has been recognised in the academic context that currently there is no hard evidence of such activity actually having a tangible impact on the outcome of elections.  The way in which Cambridge Analytica is alleged to have obtained and used personal data has been highlighted recently in the context of an ongoing and active Information Commissioner's Office, ICO, investigation.  The ICO is the UK's data protection authority.  This investigation began in May 2017 and concerns the risks of data analytics used for political purposes.  The ICO investigation spans 30 organisations, including Facebook.  Encompassed in its scope is the specific issue of how data was collected from a third party app on Facebook and shared with Cambridge Analytica.  In parallel with this ICO investigation, an Electoral Commission UK investigation is also under way in respect of campaign financing concerning the 2016 EU referendum in the UK.<br\/><br\/>It is helpful in the first instance to set out a brief chronology of the events.  The <i>Guardian <\/i>newspaper, amongst others globally, had been running stories throughout 2016 and 2017 alleging &quot;hijacking of democracy&quot; by data analytics firms such as Cambridge Analytica.  The ICO announced an investigation in May 2017 and the electoral commission in the UK announced its investigation in November 2017.  In December 2017, the ICO confirmed that its investigation involved over 30 organisations including political parties and campaigns, data companies and social media platforms.  As part of the investigation, the ICO issued a demand for access to data in the hands of Cambridge Analytica early in March.  Cambridge Analytica is alleged to have failed to respond adequately to this demand and, on 23 March 2018, the ICO obtained a warrant for entry to Cambridge Analytica&rsquo;s premises in order to inspect for relevant evidence.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The ICO investigation is ongoing with the possibility of enforcement action ultimately being taken.  The ICO has also confirmed that it will be making public policy recommendations arising out of its investigation.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, DPC, in Ireland looks forward to the outcome of the ICO&rsquo;s analysis and its recommendations.  They are likely to have broader application across EU member states, in particular in respect of the questions of whether the rules for the use of personal data in political campaigns are clear; what data sources are used for profiling the electorate for micro-targeting; and whether there are no-go areas in the context of data analytics and social media in elections.  <\/font><br\/><br\/>In summary, micro-targeting for political purposes is a potential technical subset of online behavioural advertising by social media platforms, apps, publishers and Internet sites.  The application of these techniques in Europe to process voter data is thought to be more difficult, in part because of EU data protection laws.  As I have mentioned, academics in this field are not yet certain of what, if any, the significant real effects of political micro-targeting through social media may be.  It seems that considerable research, evaluation and investigation will need to take place before concrete conclusions can be drawn about the true risks and consequences of this type of personal data processing.  However, the recent revelations have shone a spotlight on the undoubted asymmetries, arising from the inequality of resources and exacerbated now by technology, that are at play between big corporations and individuals, where those organisations collate, control and utilise big data consisting of personal data.  Public consciousness of the risks to individual rights to autonomy and self-determination resulting from these asymmetries and these types of processing of personal data is growing.  The demand for greater control over and transparency in how and why personal data is used will be facilitated by the enhanced package of data subject rights and the much more stringent obligations of controllers provided for under the GDPR, which becomes applicable across Europe on 25 May 2018.<br\/><br\/>As a data protection authority, the DPC in Ireland continues to drive awareness of individuals&rsquo; rights under both the current data protection regulatory framework and the GDPR as well as the risks for individuals when using social media services.  We have recently published guidance for users of online platforms to encourage them to control settings as they wish that dictate the extent to which they are subject to behavioural advertising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dixon and invite the assistant commissioner, Ms Neary, to give her presentation on online behavioural advertising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#K00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523970000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I supplied the committee with a PowerPoint presentation in PDF format.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Joanne Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>It is not available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#K00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523970000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I will just talk the committee through it.  I thought it would be useful to give a brief outline of online behavioural advertising, OBA.  Political micro-targeting may be a subset of it.  Many of the committee members may have heard of OBA before.  It is a form of sophisticated advertising which occurs in an online space.  Advertising networks and other organisations that serve this type of advertising include search engines and social media websites.  In simple terms, OBA is a form of targeted advertising which monitors the behaviour of individuals online and shows individuals advertisements based on information collected.  We can break it down into three main parts.  The first is the collection of personal data online.  The second is that the person is allocated into a so-called \"interest segment\" based on his or her online behaviour.  The third is that he or she is displayed ads on the basis of his or her interest segment.<\/p> <p>  What do we mean when we say that advertising networks are collecting personal information online?  Personal information online is collected via technological tools which I will speak about in a moment.  The types of information that may be collected concern the behaviour that advertising networks can track online, for example what websites individuals visit, advertisements they may have clicked or products they may have purchased or viewed.  This information is collated and individuals are put into interest segments.  For example, if I look at particular bookstores online and potentially at a particular type of book, I may be allocated to the interest segment of people who will purchase books in the future.<\/p><p>The ads are presented based on the interest segment the individual is in and that is essentially the flow of OBA.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned that a number of technological tools are employed in the online context to allow advertising networks to serve users OBA.  These tools are called cookies, tags, pixels, beacons and so on.  Many members may already have heard of cookies in particular.  We all know that when we visit websites, we get a so-called cookie banner which pops up, and the user may have to accept cookies in order to continue.  All of these tools essentially service the same purpose, namely, to track different types of information online.  I mentioned some forms of information that these types of technological tools may gather.  To expand on that, these tools are looking, for example, at the clicks a user makes on a website, how many times someone has visited a web page or how many times they have visited part of a web page.  If there is an embedded video within a web page, such tools observe how long someone has spent on that video or on other parts of the page.  They can be used to track whether an email has been opened and, if so, how long it was opened for; how often someone visits a web page; a person's buying habits as a result of clicks - whether they click through to an item and eventually buy it - and to track clicks and progression through a site and over different websites.<br\/><br\/>To take a really basic example of simple targeting versus OBA and interest-based targeting, targeting would be if I ran a website for a hotel and targeted the individuals who land on that page in relation to other types of services my hotel might offer or perhaps attractions within the area.  That would be a simple form of targeting based on the fact that the user is interested in coming to my hotel.  OBA, on the other hand, would take the behaviour that the advertising network has seen the user exhibit.  For example, if someone has gone to many websites related to spas in the area or something like that, the hotel will then show him or her related adverts.  The hotel's website might advertise its spa or a special offer on one of its treatments.  That is the progression of OBA and how it can be a more sophisticated form of targeting.<br\/><br\/>The commissioner has already touched on ways to limit OBA online and how users can do so if that is what they want.  A number of controls are available to users to limit their OBA exposure online, which exist in a number of different fora.  There are browser-based controls, for example, in Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, where there might be ways to turn off particular types of tracking.  Similarly, controls are provided by the advertising network themselves.  Those networks which serve ads might also centrally have tools people can use to adjust their OBA preferences.  The industry bodies in this area also have very good tools available.  IAB Ireland is the Irish trade association for digital advertising.  It has come up with a website, <i>youronlinechoices.eu<\/i>, in conjunction with a European affiliate.  That website shows exactly what companies or websites are tracking an individual's behaviour and gives the option to toggle them on and off.  It is a really useful tool.  It is also worth noting that individuals' OBA assessments may be linked across different devices.  They may need to adjust their choices on their mobile phone as well as on their laptop or PC.  Our guidance is available on our website in respect of tailoring social media and advertising preferences.  It also details the way in which a user can toggle his or her advertising preferences on specific social media websites.  There are other controls available on other websites that people may avail of in that regard.<br\/><br\/>Opting out of OBA does not mean one is opting out of online advertising.  Opting out of OBA means opting out of the monitoring and targeted advertising which OBA presents to users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Joanne Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Neary.

Previously, she stated that the issue of friends' data being harvested when Facebook users engaged with an app on Facebook was resolved by Facebook in May 2014, when access to friends' data was restricted by a platform upgrade.  The commissioner said that this followed a 2012 recommendation by her office on foot of its re-audit of Facebook Ireland in respect of access to friends' data.

The audits that were undertaken by the DPC in 2011 and the follow-up audit in 2012, which were published by Facebook, looked into a whole range of areas and sought to resolve a whole range of issues that were identified in respect of the compliance of this US platform with European data protection law.<\/p><p>Issues that were resolved more expeditiously included, for example, the application of facial recognition on the platform in Europe and, in fact, facial recognition has not up to this point run on the platform in Europe partly as a result of the work undertaken by the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p><p> The issue of access to friends' data when app developers access data on the Facebook platform was the subject of a recommendation by the Data Protection Commissioner.  It recommended it could not see a proportionate basis for access to friends' data when a user engaged with an app and it sought a resolution of the issue with Facebook.  The correspondence that ensued between Facebook and the Data Protection Commissioner between the recommendation and the platform upgrade in May 2014 is really reflective of the fact the guiding principle in data protection law around this type of access is that processing must be fair and proportionate.  The laws are high-level, technology-neutral and principles-based.  An iterative process was engaged in, whereby Facebook asserted its legitimate interests to implement the feature in that way.  It argued the in-app experience of users was greatly enhanced, that the very purpose of these apps was to enhance the experience of users who engaged, and that this experience was enhanced by the inclusion of users' friends when they engaged with an app.<\/p><p> An iterative process took place.  Facebook did not agree with the recommendation.  The Data Protection Commissioner persisted, as I have said, in the iterative process, resulting in the platform upgrade 18 months later.  It is probably worth mentioning in the context of the response that there are obviously many ways to go about persuading a company to make a change to comply with data protection laws or to comply with our interpretation of data protection laws.  One way is to go about a litigation route.  We have taken that route with Facebook on the issue of transfers of data from the EU to the US.  We made an application to the High Court in May 2016 seeking a reference to the European Court of Justice.  The High Court ruled in October 2017 that it would make a reference and that reference is still pending.  The life cycle of litigation is uncertain and very lengthy.  In this regard, I might just mention an important piece of litigation that has been undertaken by the Belgian data protection commissioner, who is litigating against Facebook on social plug-ins.  The litigation started in 2014 and it is not yet resolved four years later.  The life cycle of taking a litigation enforcement route can be long.<\/p><p> With regard to Deputy Dooley's questions on whether the segments are published, and he spoke specifically about Facebook, in fact Facebook users can go in and look at what segments they have been placed into with regard to interest-based advertising.  On every advertisement served on a user on Facebook one can look to see why it has been served.  A user may well see it is because he is male and in a certain age category.  There is a certain amount of information with regard to the segments, and users can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising based on their placement in any of those segments.<\/p><p> Under the GDPR there will be additional obligations on data controllers to publish more information on the fact of their profiling of individuals and how they profile individuals.  They will also need to publish the basic logic of the algorithms they are supplying.  We anticipate we will see from all of the platforms, including Facebook, significant improvements in transparency come 25 May 2018.<\/p><p> In relation to the tracking of Facebook users once they leave the Facebook environment, Facebook will, of course, confirm the position to the committee when it comes before it later, but it is the case that users are tracked once they leave the Facebook environment.  There are means by which users can switch off the tracking, but the issues around all of the control settings that Ms Neary outlined earlier relate to how accessible they are and how transparent it is to the users in the first instance that the default is that they are being tracked.<\/p><p>All of these issues are under active examination by our office with Facebook.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>On that particular point, has Ms Dixon given any consideration to limiting the potential for tracking outside of the environment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#O00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523970000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>This is an issue that does not relate only to Facebook and recently, in fact just last week, we made a statement to our peers at the article 29 working party of EU data protection authorities.

Importantly, in the context of setting out that strategic vision on which we anticipated consulting our fellow data protection authorities, we also set out for them that there is a need to look much more systemically at the whole ad tech sector.

There is a need for us as a group of data protection authorities to divvy out the work and ensure we are tackling all of these issues and not just one platform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I also raised the issue of the protection of journalistic-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#O00400","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>If Ms Dixon feels she cannot answer those questions, she does not have to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#O00500","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523970000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I cannot answer those questions, other than to confirm we are investigating the matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>If I could just ask Ms Dixon to address it in a general way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#O00700","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Ms Dixon has clarified the position on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#O00800","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I want to object to that.

The commercial premise on which social media are based is to get the names of people and their data and advertise to them.  This is how they get a commercial return.

In this context, will Ms Dixon go through what she thinks of the current situation?  The people watching us today will be interested to know as of today how an individual can protect his or her data.  What specific steps can people take?  Are there sufficient opportunities for people who might not be very technologically competent to protect their personal data and clearly know to do it?  I am not sure there is an awareness there.  How does Ms Dixon think we could improve on what is there now?  I know legislation is pending to deal with fake accounts.  Fake accounts are very serious and all of us in this room have been adversely affected at certain times by people using fake accounts to disseminate falsehoods or false arguments.  Does Ms Dixon think the legislation will be sufficiently adequate in this regard?

In some cases, a fine can be 20% of a platform&rsquo;s gross turnover, which could be an enormous sum.  The commissioner spoke about going through a process with the platforms and litigation is the least likely one she would pursue.  However, if an issue went into litigation and it was to receive a maximum fine, what would that mean to the actual platform involved?  Does the commissioner feel the fines are so large that she will be tied up in the legal process because the platform cannot afford to lose?

Policymakers are looking at all these issues, particularly in the context of the EU e-privacy regulation and whether more services will end up behind paywalls to avoid the tracking of users.<\/p> <p>  At the moment, users are being tracked in order to offer free Internet services.

Nobody knew what it meant.  There was no pop-up or bubble beside it to explain what it meant if one toggled it one way or another.  It has been inadequate to date.<\/p> <p>  We have high hopes of what the GDPR is demanding in terms of obligations on data controllers.  We have promises from all the major platforms that we are going to see something significantly new and different around transparency come 25 May 2018.  We will be supervising this to ensure we see a whole new level of transparency.<\/p> <p>  The platforms tell us that they have been using new design methods in order to better engage users around privacy settings.  There are also new principles in the GDPR such as privacy by design, privacy by default and data minimisation requirements, which will provide extra supervisory hooks for us in terms of how the platforms operate.<\/p> <p>  On European and Irish elections, it is important that users who engage on online platforms and consume their news mainly through these, engage with the control settings.  If they choose to receive interest-based advertising, which some users legitimately choose, they have to be aware they may be subject to advertising which is pushing them in one specific direction and ensure they consume other types of news from other publishers, rather than relying solely on social media.<\/p><p>Regarding Irish elections, data protection laws and the GDPR are strong enough to prohibit personal data processing.  The ground-breaking investigation the UK Information Commissioners Office is undertaking on novel uses of data analytics in the electoral context will provide useful policy outcomes which will have application across all EU member states.  The UK commissioner has updated that she hopes to have some outputs from that investigation next month.<\/p><p> Senator Lombard correctly cited the level of fines under GDPR will be high.  They can come to 20% of global turnover in certain cases.  When one looks at the global turnover of the platforms, this could be a significant sum of money.  I have attended several events recently at which the MEP and former European Commissioner who proposed the GDPR, Viviane Reding, has said these levels of fines are comparable to competition law fines because it is necessary to grab the attention of the industry, particularly regarding the importance of protecting personal data.  Will we end up tied up in litigation processes challenging any decision we make to apply a significant fine?  That is certainly a possibility.  The stakes are going to be much higher in terms of the outcome of any investigation.  We conclude the corrective powers we exercise and the sanctions we decide to apply.<\/p><p> We could look at recent examples from the competition law sphere.  Last year, the European Commission fined Facebook WhatsApp &euro;125 million concerning information it did or did not give the Commission during its assessment of its merger application in 2014.  That was not appealed.  The European Commission fined Google &euro;2.6 billion in the summer of 2016, due to favouring its own shopping comparison website.  That was not appealed either.  It will be circumstantial in some cases as to whether the decisions are appealed.  However, undoubtedly, there will be more litigation across the board regarding all types of sectors we regulate and where we seek to impose significant sanctions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  Will the new data protection regulations protect us from what happened with Cambridge Analytica?

In her presentation, Ms Dixon stated there is no certainty with how effective political micro-targeting is.  Some people in the political world might disagree with that.  In the context of Brexit, which is having a significant impact on this island and our neighbouring island, is there not a relevance in micro-targeting?<\/p> <p>  There is a particular concern about young people under 18 years of age.

It is fascinating stuff.  I was very keen to hear Ms Neary's presentation because of the emphasis on online advertising and how online advertising can grab behaviour, attitudes, likes and dislikes of individuals to then target them for particular messaging.  The reason I am concerned about it is because of the upcoming referendum.  It is really interesting to note that as the new data protection regulations in Europe will be brought in on 25 May, the very day the referendum is being held, they will not cover the period between now and when the referendum is held.  I have serious concerns, as do many people, given the recent revelations regarding Cambridge Analytica and the use it made of people's information on Facebook.  It has been reported that some 87 million Facebook users were affected by the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.  One of its former employees, Thomas Borwick, has been engaged by the \"No\" side in the referendum campaign to produce online advertising.  That connection in itself is a big worry for what may happen in terms of influencing the democratic outcome of the referendum.<\/p> <p>  I am bit mixed up.  The commissioner does not perceive that she might have a role in this.  She tells us, and this is obviously her legal job description, that she is concerned with the enforcement of data subject rights and the supervision of organisations that hold, use and control personal data of individuals.  She then says that her office has no role in regulating the core aspects of electoral activity, including advertising and canvassing activities other than where those personal data are deployed.  Could she comment on that and clarify whether she does not perceive her own role to involve querying what might be happening with the use of personal data in the referendum campaign?  She has stated her role does not overlap with electoral activity other than where those personal data are deployed.  If it has been proved that companies like Cambridge Analytica and others have used personal data to influence democratic outcomes in other countries, would she have concerns about that in the current referendum campaign?  <\/p> <p>  The commissioner says she is concerned about vulnerable Internet users such as children.  Does she not think there is a whole cohort of vulnerable Internet users, such as older people a bit like myself, who grew up in an age where we did not automatically learn about social media and how to use it and that there is a cohort of the electorate that is very vulnerable to that type of advertising?<\/p><p>Regarding the impact of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, of those 87 million Facebook users who were affected, has the commissioner an idea as to how many of them are based in Ireland?

It is intended not only to be a modernised law for Europe but to be harmonised.  It is intended that there will be a much more co-ordinated and consistent application of the law across the EU than there has been heretofore, where there have been separate and fragmented transpositions of the 1995 directive in EU member states.  To that end, where the Irish Data Protection Commissioner acts as the lead supervisory authority in supervising any entity, we must consult with other data protection authorities as we go and must take the utmost account of the views of other data protection authorities.  Ultimately, any of those other data protection authorities can offer a relevant and reasoned objection to any conclusions or findings we make in an investigation.  That is with the aim of ensuring there is a consistent and co-ordinated application of the law.<\/p> <p>  There are also very strong provisions for mutual assistance between the data protection authorities in the GDPR.  Currently, it is the case that Cambridge Analytica is a data controller in data protection terms that is located in the UK and subject to the jurisdiction of the Information Commissioner's Office in the UK.  However, in conducting her investigation, the Information Commissioner proactively had a call for an hour with me yesterday and is keeping relevant data protection authorities up to date regarding her investigation and we are assisting in any way we can.  Consequently, there are ways in which the new regulation can be brought to bear regardless of the location of an entity.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of political micro-targeting, the Deputy mentioned Brexit.  As I outlined earlier, the Information Commissioner in the UK is concentrating on the application of data protection law to the use of big data analytics and micro-targeting so in particular, she is looking at what sources of data a company like Cambridge Analytica has.  Is it procuring data from data brokers in Europe?  Are those data being lawfully procured?  It now appears as though it might have procured data from Facebook that was not lawfully procured.  The Information Commissioner in the UK is looking specifically at the sources of data, the legal basis for the processing, whether the UK electorate could have been aware that its data were being processed in that way by data analytics firms and so on.  In one of her recent appearances before a parliamentary committee in the UK, she said she is not expecting a smoking gun in any shape or form but her investigation has not yet concluded.  It is concentrated around the data protection issues relating to the likes of Cambridge Analytica.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding juveniles and young users of the Internet, the GDPR over and above the 1995 directive is now calling out that children merit special protection in a data protection sense.  There are a number of provisions in the GDPR relating to child users.<\/p><p>In particular, Article 8 of the GDPR now allows member states set an age over which a child will not require the consent of parents to access information services online.  As the committee is aware, that age has been set at 13 in Ireland. <\/p><p> There is a requirement now for data controllers, and in particular for online service providers, to show that they are giving children the special additional protection that they merit.  This may be in the form of modified services that are appropriate to the age of development of users, and it may be certainly be represented in terms of the type of transparency and plain language notices that are offered to children.  The platforms that we supervise have told us that we will see differentiated services in some cases being offered to children from 25 May 2018.<\/p><p> In relation to Deputy Smith's questions in respect of behaviours and attitudes and political micro-targeting, the Deputy said she was confused following the opening statement regarding the role of the DPC.  Our opening statement was designed to convey that the particular legislation that the committee intends to carry out scrutiny on today is not a matter for comment by this office as to whether there is a requirement for an imprint on a political advertisement that shows the original funder.  We are concerned, however, with every aspect of electoral activity and political activity that concerns the processing of personal data.<\/p><p> In relation to Cambridge Analytica and the 87 million users who were mostly based in the USA, what was at issue in that particular case was that Dr. Kogan at Cambridge University, who was originally the app developer who accessed the data from Facebook's platform, is alleged to have transmitted it on, contrary to Facebook's policies, to Cambridge Analytica.  He had been doing psychometric research at Cambridge University based on a model called OCEAN, which concerns personality traits of individuals, such as openness and conscientiousness, right through to where on the scale of neurotica a person stands.  What was asserted to be the case was that individuals could be micro-targeted based on these personality profiles and classifications and I pointed out that social scientists and academics, who are looking now live at this area, say there is no evidence that targeting based on that type of personality and psychometric segmentation has happened or that it has manipulated results.<\/p><p> Further research is needed in this area, but it is undoubtedly the case, because it is happening already in an offline context as well as an online context, that there is political micro-targeting.  It is not necessarily harmful or a bad thing that there would be some targeting of messages.  It happens in an offline context where posters or particular issues that politicians want to promote relative to a geographic area in which individuals live are segmented and targeted messages are delivered to the constituents in that way.  Not all political micro-targeting is harmful, and not all of it involves a manipulation of users data in a way that they would not anticipate.  <\/p><p> Individuals have some level of control, albeit the transparency around how they can exercise that control is not yet good enough and we expect to see an improvement from May under the GDPR.  Users need to be aware that if they have not exercised their controls online to switch off interest-based advertising, they are being targeted based on segments that the platforms deem them to be interested in.<\/p><p> In relation to the 87 million affected users, and Facebook confirmed these figures, 15 individuals in Ireland downloaded the app that Dr. Kogan published and up to 44,000 Irish users were affected as friends of users who downloaded the app in that their data was accessed by Dr. Kogan and, it is alleged, passed to Cambridge Analytica.  <\/p><p> In terms of vulnerable Internet users, the Deputy is absolutely correct.  Children were just an example of vulnerable Internet users.  There are many reasons that the GDPR, as proposed and enacted, now requires privacy by design and default and encodes these new principles.<\/p><p>Under the GDPR, in order to ensure that before users have to search and look for controls about what it should switch off and switch on, they should be already able to anticipate that there is a level of default protection when they arrive on the platform.  This is what we anticipate we are going to see, not just from the platforms but from all sorts of sectors and data controllers from 25 May 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>My last question was not answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#U00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>We are under time constraints, so very briefly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#U00300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>The last question I asked was in relation to the example of INM.

He was very specific in raising concerns about the ability of Facebook to do exactly that in its system in Europe.<\/p> <p>  My understanding is that that process, where one has that audit in 2011 and 2012, the recommendation or the direction - I am not what word one would use - or the instruction to Facebook to stop that capability was very centre stage.  It was not a peripheral issue; it was a very significant issue.  In regard to that process, in terms of this audited approach, is it what the commissioner calls \"an engaged regulatory process\", where it is iterative and where, as the commissioner says, it engages with the company?  I heard the commissioner's response earlier on but it beggars belief that having gone through that iterative process and having gone through two audit processes, which one presumes had reached a conclusion in terms of the contents of the audit having been discussed - it was not that Facebook was just presented with an audit without any engagement prior to that - that it resisted the implementation of that direction from the Data Protection Commissioner for 18 months.<\/p><p>They presented an audit without any prior engagement.  Then for 18 months they resisted the implementation of that direction from the Data Protection Commissioner.  The witness said taking a litigious route would have been difficult but the fact that the company ignored that recommendation, and the central points of Max Schrems' complaint and proceeded for that period, allowed Cambridge Analytica harvest the data which had not insignificant consequences for democratic systems elsewhere.<\/p><p> In the iterative process the witnesses have described did the Data Protection Commission ask Facebook for written confirmation that such data breaches were not occurring?  When did it first become aware of the Cambridge Analytica case and what sanctions, if any, can it apply as a regulator with regard to what happened in that case?  I heard the witnesses mention the fine when WhatsApp and Facebook were exchanging data despite Facebook's having made a commitment that would not be done.  Is there not still an issue with, for example, WhatsApp, where my understanding is that my friends' data is being harvested for use by the company?  It may not be, or at least I hope it is not, transferred to Facebook.  Within the company, however, it is harvestable data.  Do the witnesses think it appropriate that people's data and contact information, which sometimes can be quite extensive, can be used for commercial purposes without their consent?  Is that fair and proportionate on that principle? <\/p><p> On the issue of data surveillance in foreign jurisdictions, and standing up for our country, Judge Gerard Hogan and the Irish court system deserve great credit for the way they have raised such issues with the European Court of Justice to defend the rights of European citizens.  Judge Hogan's judgments were exemplary in grappling with incredibly complex and difficult issues.  Is the witnesses' opinion that all Irish data is subject to surveillance by the UK Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ, when it exits this country on a fibre network going through the UK?  What implications are there in the recent judgments, or work of the Data Protection Commissioner in regard to surveillance of data in other jurisdictions outside the EU, that may apply post Brexit?  Is the commission considering that and can it help to guide the committee because we are interested in the wider policy issues and what we should do about that?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#U00800","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>The Max Schrems case which generated an investigation by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner in 2012 related to third party consent which is exactly what the Kogan app used in 2013 which came out of Cambridge Analytica in 2016, 2017 and 2018.

The Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, did it in respect of Brexit but that is not a negative comment on the DUP.  It saw that loophole and used it.<\/p> <p>  I echo Senator O'Reilly's comment about the need for a clear opportunity to opt out.  I am probably one of the least computer literate people in this room and someone like me just brushes aside little messages about cookies and privacy policy.  I just want to read an article.  I never stop to think what the little pop-up message means but it should be possible to develop pop-up information packages, which are mandatory and are directed by the commission, on service providers in Ireland.  In other words, for example, Facebook should every month remind people with a clear message, not three pages of close print, about privacy settings and what a user can opt out of.  <\/p> <p>  Speaking from a position of comparative ignorance, do the switch off advertising controls mean that the harvesting of data is also switched off?  To use Deputy Ryan's point, does it mean that one's service provider can accumulate and store data about one without using it for advertising purpose but for other purposes?

The witnesses have spoken of their concerns about litigation but there is an option between recommendation and litigation, which is an enforcement notice.<\/p><p> The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has the power under section 10 to issue enforcement notices.  Is it not the case that, if it were to have made use of that kind of enforcement notice in 2011 and 2012, the Cambridge Analytica breach might not have happened in 2013?  Perhaps Ms Dixon could clarify also the question of how many enforcement notices the office has issued against State bodies or private companies?  This is a robust existing power that does not require litigation and which can be used.  It is a concern that there would be unwillingness, if there is that lead supervisory role, to use enforcement orders.  For example, an issue which has come up a few times here is the question of privacy by default.  I have been concerned that there is quite a lot of language about switching off settings.  Can Ms Dixon confirm, for example, that we must have all privacy settings at the highest level and there must always be a situation of switching on an agreement to any action that shares data, rather than switching off the taking of data, which is a very important distinction?  Again, there is a question of enforcement in that regard.<\/p><p> I was a little concerned at some of the language around Cambridge Analytica and the idea we are still waiting for hard evidence of it influencing political outcomes.  Leaving aside the fact we have the vast commercial infrastructure that is based on micro-targeted advertising as evidence that it is clearly seen as having an effect - indeed, that is the main product offered by many of the commercial platforms - and leaving aside the fact we have long-established regulation in regard to electoral advertising because it has been identified as an area that needs regulation, so it would be extraordinary if we were not already on a presumption that it is having an effect, there is also the precautionary principle, which is a key principle in European regulation.  Ms Dixon might address that question of the precautionary principle and whether we have an onus to take immediate action in areas where we feel there is a danger, rather than waiting for a long academic process in regard to the proven impacts in that regard.<\/p><p> I was also concerned with the idea that we are waiting for the ICO to make public policy recommendations that may have broader application for EU member states.  While the ICO has its investigation in regard to Cambridge Analytica, I would think, given the lead supervisory role Ireland holds, that Ireland should be moving ahead and taking a lead, not simply looking forward to the outcomes from the ICO.  Given that lead supervisory role, with Facebook Ireland serving 83% of all global Facebook users, I would like Ms Dixon to comment in particular on the issues around Article 9 of the GDPR and what she thinks the implications of Article 9 will be in regard to this area, specifically Article 9.2(d), which concerns the processing of special categories of personal data, that is, data around political or religious opinions and sexual orientation, and which, of course, includes photographs.  These are issues which have been identified as needing particular protection and they, of course, form part of the profiling work by organisations like Cambridge Analytica.  Will Ms Dixon clarify this specific question?  In Article 9.2(d) it is clear the exemptions which are given around processing by political bodies, such as political parties, are for not-for-profit bodies and there is a prohibition on the sharing of that personal data or the work outside that body.  Does Ms Dixon believe this part of the GDPR will provide a prohibition against any for-profit commercial company which seeks to process special categories of personal data without consent?  Does she believe that is adequately provided for in Article 9?  While it is legislation that is under way, Ms Dixon might also be free to comment on whether she believes this is adequately provided for in the Data Protection Bill?<\/p><p> In regard to the \"honest ads\" provisions and the online transparency proposals from Deputy Lawless, I believe there is a question around transparency, who is using the data and whether it is with permission.  There is an assumption it is only about using the mechanisms around online behavioural targeting but there is the question of that data being shared.<\/p><p> On the gathering and storing of data external to Europe, we have seen online quizzes that are under way not necessarily on Facebook but on Google and other platforms that are seeking to build political profiles, and we have seen companies that have been gathering facial profiles and building databases in that regard.  While I know the pending High Court referral will help on that issue, Ms Dixon might touch on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#W00300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>There are many questions and we are short on time.

In response to Deputy Eamon Ryan, we would welcome receipt of the 14 questions he wants to submit in writing and we will be happy to respond.  The Deputy talked about the delay in terms of Facebook implementing the recommendation.  Again, looking back, although we never thought what Facebook was doing was proportionate, the issue of evolving social norms cannot be ignored when we are looking at novel applications of technology in an area like social media, which was still quite new in 2010-11.  Max Schrems was not the only person calling out this issue about access to friends data - civil society bodies like the American Civil Liberties Union in the US had also been highlighting it.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the iterative process that was engaged in, we have this type of process with actors in all sectors.  Given that there is an interpretation required of what is high-level, principles-based law in any particular area of application, be it in the insurance sector or the banking sector, or on a social media platform, there is a period when there has to be some type of iterative process where we share with a regulated entity what our interpretation of the law is and how it applies in a very particular scenario.  It is legitimate that there may be push-back and an assertion of a legal basis or an assertion of proportionality, but, ultimately, that was not accepted by our office and the issue was resolved.<br\/><br\/>It is very easy to look back and say things were black and white.  An example of an evolving social norm that might be helpful to consider in this context is the issue of caller ID.  When this first came out in the 1990s, users considered it an invasion of privacy if someone they were calling could recognise their number and if their caller ID was automatically submitted.  Now, very few people would answer their mobile phone if they could not see who was calling them, so there has been a 360&deg; spin in terms of the social norm around caller ID.  While it is just one example and I am not saying the access to friends data fell into that category, what I am suggesting is that there is often a process with all types of sectors and it is not simply black and white.<br\/><br\/>In terms of when we became aware of the Cambridge Analytica case, it was on 16 March when the story was broken in <i>The Observer<\/i>.  It was not new news to us that friends data had been accessed and it was a feature of the platform until Facebook made the upgrade.  What was new news to us was that <i>The Guardian<\/i>had contacted Facebook in 2015 in regard to allegations that all of the data had not been deleted by Cambridge Analytica.<br\/><br\/>In terms of sanctions, looking at it under the current legislation, in particular the Irish Data Protection Acts, the committee will be aware there are very few offences under the current legislation and the legislation is directed towards compelling compliance with the Acts.  Under the GDPR, clearly, the sanctions are considerably higher.<br\/><br\/>There are three use cases for data sharing that were proposed by WhatsApp and Facebook when WhatsApp sought to amend its privacy policy after the approved merger.  Two of them related to business analytics and security on the platform and the third use case relates to sharing of data between the two entities as controllers for the purposes of ad serving and friend suggestions.<\/p><p>We have prohibited that use and Facebook and WhatsApp have provided us with an undertaking that they will not implement that use case until the DPC is satisfied that there is a legal basis for doing so.  Deputy Eamon Ryan asked whether what we are discussing could be done without a person's consent.  The answer is \"No\".<\/p><p> The Deputy also referred to contact lists, which are covered in one of the recitals to the GDPR.  This is an area of the law at which we intend to look further in circumstances in which the recital under the GDPR clarifies matters.  This happens with all platforms and Internet service providers.  Platforms give users the option to upload the contact lists on their phones to be managed by the Internet service to facilitate the user.  The recital in the GDPR spells out, quite correctly, that the uploading of the contact list from a person's phone is done under the so-called \"household exemption\" under data protection law.  As such, when one acts under this exemption, the full laws do not apply in terms of uploading the list.  However, further use and processing of that contact list by the platform or any controller requires a legal basis.  I am not sure if the Deputy is bringing to our attention the fact that some platform is making further use of material.  If so, we would be interested to receive the information.<\/p><p> Deputy Eamon Ryan's final question related to data surveillance and GCHQ post Brexit.  The EU Commission is already being pushed by the UK in this regard and will be required to agree some type of mutual recognition of the UK having an adequate level of data protection.  Assuming that there is no such recognition, the UK will undoubtedly seek an adequacy finding from the EU Commission.  It will be the responsibility of the Commission to conduct a full analysis in the context of making an adequacy finding in respect of the UK.  We will co-operate in that process.<\/p><p> Deputy Lawless referred to Cambridge Analytica.  I note that some 300,000 users directly engaged and gave consent to the downloading of the app.  If it transpires to be true that Dr. Kogan passed the data to Cambridge Analytica, that would have occurred in any event minus the friend data had that been restricted.  The supervision activity Ms Neary is undertaking with Facebook is around the case regardless of whether friend data was accessed or not, how Facebook vets apps, how Facebook controls the permissions it gives apps and what examination it is carrying out of the privacy policy proposed by an app developer.<\/p><p> On the issue of warrants, we have very strong powers already to enter premises.  We conducted almost 100 on-site inspections and investigations last year.  Some of those involved dawn raids conducted by the assistant commissioner, Mr. Tony Delaney, regarding a series of prosecutions he has commenced involving private investigators.  Our powers are further strengthened under the new Data Protection Bill.  While we will continue to have the same powers to enter, we will also gain the ability to obtain warrants from the District Court where there is an objection by controller to our entry onto a premises.  We are confident about those powers.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about the level of industry readiness in the context of the GDPR.  Our office has undertaken a huge awareness campaign, particularly during the past 12 months.  We surveyed the industry, especially SMEs and microenterprises, a year out from the GDPR.  We saw that while there was a high level of awareness of the new laws, there was a great deal less preparedness in respect of them.  We are rerunning the survey and should have the results next week.  We can keep the committee updated on that.<\/p><p> I was asked about the huge number of events at which we have spoken and the type of representative bodies, for example, the Small Firms Association, with which we have engaged.  There has been huge engagement in Ireland on the GDPR and there is a high level of awareness.  However, there are some areas in respect of which organisations are not fully prepared, including some of the new ones covered under the directive.  In particular, the requirement to deliver higher standards of protection for children is an area in respect of which we have not seen the level of engagement we want.<\/p><p> Senator McDowell asked about a situation whereby someone from Northern Ireland might want to influence matters.  He or she could seek to influence offline or online.  The question related to online and data protection issues.  I cannot speak to what electoral laws would apply.  I presume finance and transparency provisions would apply to whoever was funding a campaign in terms of making a declaration.  In the context of targeting online, such an entity could purchase advertising with Facebook and target based on segments.<\/p><p> I was asked about clear opportunities to opt out.  The opportunities are not clear enough.  We have been having the same discussion since I became Data Protection Commissioner.  Those who are in the data protection business longer than me say that we have been having the same discussion for ten or 20 years.  This is why Ms Viviane Reding has said that the time has come for punitive fines and a new, modernised, fit-for-purpose law, which is something we will have from next month.  Aside from clear opportunities to opt out, free Internet services based on the monetising of personal data and the way in which the ad-tech sector operates require us to unravel and look behind the whole sector.  In data protection terms, any publisher or newspaper using social plug-ins and dropping third-party cookies from its website is the controller in those instances and has obligations under the law.  This is what we have started to discuss with our fellow data protection authorities.  As we supervise the platform and its responsibility, there is a need to look at all of the other players in a sector which has a very long tail that leads to opaqueness for users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I am sorry to cut Ms Dixon off.

As this is the first hearing of the scrutiny of my Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill 2017, I shall briefly outline the legislation for the benefit of committee members and all interested parties before moving on to the Facebook engagement.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Electoral Acts were written largely in 1992 and have seen little update since.  All of that happened before the existence of the Internet, broadband and certainly before social media.  As such, the Acts do not cover online space at all.  <\/p> <p>  The Broadcasting Act is an anomaly in the sense that political advertising on television and radio is completely prohibited.  We have governance on paper, materials, election posters and a complete ban on television and radio advertisements yet a total vacuum exists in the online regulatory space.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has said that online advertising and social media advertising is out of scope.  The Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, has said that it does not have a role under the current legislation.  The Data Protection Commissioner has an interest in personal data but not in political online campaigning.  Also, the Referendum Commission of Ireland, for the forthcoming referendum, has said that online campaigning is out of scope for it as well.  We have a situation where the Internet remains like the Wild West electorally.<\/p> <p>  The reason the funding of campaigns has always been regulated is because of the fundamental principle that democracy should not be available to the highest bidder.  We have expenditure limits, campaign monitoring, the governance of fundraising and a ban on television advertising.  All of that subscribes to the basic principle that there should be a level playing field as much as possible and that anybody can compete in politics at the entry level.  Again, none of this applies online. <\/p> <p>  As we have seen in recent elections that have taken place around the world, such as in the US, the Brexit referendum and in many other jurisdictions, and specifically Cambridge Analytica, it has been possible to enter the online domain, spend an awful lot of money and disproportionately affect the outcome of elections using very sophisticated techniques.  It is important that we move to manage that gap in Ireland.  I introduced First Stage of my Bill in the D&aacute;il and it passed Second Stage before Christmas.  My Bill seeks to do a number of things to regulate the sector.  My Bill embraces online advertising and views it as a good thing.  My Bill sees political online advertisements as democratising to some extent.  There is a low barrier to entry.  My Bill seeks to put transparency front and centre of any political advertising.  It requires a transparency notice, which means the advertiser must state who they are, identify the publisher, identify the sponsor and whether a targeting algorithm has been applied.  There is a ban on bots.  Where multiple fake accounts artificially promote a particular viewpoint, bots can bombard somebody to make something appear unpopular or conversely multiply something to make it appear very popular.  Bots skew online discourse, which has a negative impact on democracy.  <\/p> <p>  When I was preparing my Bill I engaged with many civic society groups, including the National Union of Journalists, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Amnesty International, Uplift and the Transparent Referendum Initiative.  All of the organisations broadly support my Bill and its measures.  They view the measures in my legislation as very important..<\/p> <p>  I thank Facebook, with which I engaged at the outset last year on this legislation.  I have found it to be fair, co-operative, collaborative and very keen to see the legislative measures implemented.  Twitter, Google and the other social media platforms have also been involved. <\/p> <p>  The Bill is needed.  There is a broad consensus among the technical sphere and the civic society sphere that my legislation is needed.  Unfortunately, the Government remains ambiguous about the legislation.  I hope it will come around and I think it will.  The parliamentary legal advice has deemed the Bill to be relatively solid and some amendments will be tidied up.  The view from civic society and elsewhere is that the legislation is needed.  We just need to get on with the process.  Today is our first engagement and I look forward to the session ahead.  I know that the Clerk to the Committee will arrange further engagements with other witnesses over the next number of weeks and months.  It is a matter of when the Bill becomes law.<\/p> <p>  Again, I welcome the delegation from Facebook and I look forward to the engagement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#CC00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Joel Kaplan, Vice President of global policy in Facebook.

Ms Sweeney, Mr. Lambe, Ms Nagle and Ms Rush are all based at our international headquarters located in Dublin.<\/p><p> I shall start by echoing what has been said by our chief executive officer, Mr. Mark Zuckerberg.  What happened with Cambridge Analytica represents a huge violation of trust, for which we are deeply sorry.  We now serve more than 2 billion people around the world who use our services to stay connected with the people who matter most to them.  We know we have a responsibility to the Facebook community and that people will only feel comfortable using our service if their data is safe.<\/p><p> As our second largest office globally, Facebook Ireland plays an important part in providing that service, with more than 2,500 people working across multiple teams at our international headquarters located in the docklands of Dublin.  As Facebook has grown, people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool to stay connected to the people they care about, make their voices heard and build communities and businesses.  It is now clear that we did not do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well.  We did not take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a mistake.<\/p><p> I will not repeat the detailed timeline in my written statement but I will highlight some key points.  In 2014, we made some big changes to the Facebook platform to restrict the amount of data that developers can access and proactively review the apps on our platform.  This means that today a developer cannot do what Dr. Kogan did four years ago.  In 2015, when we learned that Dr. Kogan had shared the data we banned his app from our platform and demanded that all improperly acquired data be deleted.  Last month, when we learned from the media that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as it had certified, we banned the organisation from using any of our services.<\/p><p> Most of the people impacted by this matter were predominantly in the United States.  However, as members will have heard from the Data Protection Commissioner, Ms Dixon, we understand that 15 people in Ireland installed Dr. Kogan's app.  Also, up to 44,687 people in Ireland may have been friends with someone who installed the app and, therefore, may have been affected.  We are notifying all of those people.  We have a responsibility to make sure that what happened with Dr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica does not happen again.  As a result, we are limiting the information that developers can access using Facebook login and we are putting additional safeguards in place to prevent abuse.  We are also in the process of investigating every app that had access to a large amount of information before 2014.  If we find that someone is improperly using data then we will ban him or her and tell everyone affected.  We are making it easier to understand which apps people have allowed to access their data and turning off the access to information on any app that they have not used in 90 days.  We have expanded Facebook's bug bounty programme so that people can also report to us if they find misuses of data by app developers.   We know that there is a lot of work to be done and that this is just the beginning.  <\/p><p> Over the past four weeks we have co-operated with Ms Dixon, as our lead regulator, and her office as they have sought to establish what happened and how Irish and EU users may have been affected by Cambridge Analytica.  We have shared detailed information with that office about our past and current practices.  We continue to engage with them on same.  To be frank, the Data Protection Commissioner has been critical of us in recent weeks.  We recognise and understand those criticisms.  We could and should have done better when responding to concerns.  We are committed to doing better going forward.<\/p><p> On 25 May, the General Data Protection Regulation will take effect.  Under the regulation, Ms Dixon and her team will become our lead supervisory authority.  Transparency is a fundamental requirement of the GDPR.  Our teams have worked hard, for the past 18 months, to make key changes to our products that will give our users greater control over their data and visibility as to how they can exercise that control.  We take the GPDR very seriously.  It places additional standards on companies, which is a good thing.  We need to rebuild trust with our users and compliance with the GDPR is critical to that.  We have been working with the Data Protection Commission on our final products.  We welcome the time invested by that office in an ongoing engagement with Facebook and the feedback that we have received on our GDPR implementation plan.<\/p><p> Finally, I will comment on the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill 2017.  I know that Deputy Lawless met our team when he first proposed his Bill.  We very much appreciate that he sought to engage with us on his legislation from the outset.  We fully understand and appreciate what his Bill seeks to achieve and we are aligned with its goals.  It mirrors, in a large part, what we are trying to achieve with the new advertisement transparency tools that we have announced.  We agree that when it comes to advertising on Facebook people should be able to see all of the advertisements that a page is running.  Also, when it comes to political advertisements, all advertisers should be verified and any advertisements that they run should be clearly labelled to show who paid for them.  We are working hard to build out these transparency tools and roll them out globally.  However, it takes time to do so and, most important, it takes time to get right.  I am able to report the following to the committee today.<\/p><p>As of 25 April, we will add Ireland to our pilot programme for the first phase of our efforts on transparency, namely, the \"view ads\" tool.  This will enable Irish users to see all the advertisements every advertiser is running on Facebook at the same time.  We hope it will bring greater transparency to advertisements running in the context of the forthcoming referendum on the eighth amendment.  <\/p><p> As I am sure the members will have comments and questions, I will stop there.  I thank the committee for inviting us to be here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joel Kaplan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kaplan for his contribution.

Mr. Kaplan can make a note of the questions as we go around the members of the committee before returning at various intervals.<\/p><p>I posed a question to the Data Protection Commissioner about this issue earlier.  Mr. Kaplan stated that in 2014, Facebook said it was changing its platform to significantly limit the information apps could access based on recommendations from the data commissioner.

Did Facebook check or confirm that this had happened?  The witnesses say that only last month, Facebook learned that the data may not have been deleted.

I would like the witnesses to address a number of matters arising from the written submission provided to the committee before the meeting.  It notes that &quot;As our CEO explained last week, Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company&quot; and then goes on to state:<\/p><blockquote>it's clear now that we didn&rsquo;t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well [as good].  We didn&rsquo;t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a mistake.<\/blockquote> <p>It is as though the submission is looking for the fool's pardon, as we say in Ireland, that Facebook has been somewhat naive and is almost the victim and has been taken advantage by these app developers.  <\/p><p>I will read into the record a memo with which the witnesses will be familiar.  It was circulated internally in their company by one of its senior vice presidents, Mr. Andrew Bosworth.  I will quote several sections of it rather than go through it in detail.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>We connect people ...  So we connect more people.  That can be bad if they make it negative.  Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies.  Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. ... The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good.  It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned.<br \/><br \/>...  That&rsquo;s why all the work we do in growth is justified.  All the questionable contact importing practices.  All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends.  All of the work we do to bring more communication in.  The work we will likely have to do in China some day.<\/blockquote> <p>Later, it goes on: <\/p><blockquote>The best products don&rsquo;t win.  The ones everyone use win.  ...  We do have great products but we still wouldn&rsquo;t be half our size without pushing the envelope on growth.  Nothing makes Facebook as valuable as having your friends on it, and no product decisions have gotten as many friends on as the ones made in growth.  Not photo tagging.  Not news feed.  Not messenger.  Nothing.<\/blockquote><p>I am sure the witnesses are familiar with the latter; it has been well circulated in the media.  I accept that it was written in 2016, two years after the 2014 watershed to which the witnesses referred as addressing many of the concerns.  When did Mr. Bosworth leave the company or when was he fired?  Is he still with the company?  It seems to me that if one reads that memorandum, it speaks to a DNA within Facebook of pushing the envelope of growth over everything else.<\/p><p> Facebook makes a lot of users owning their data.  Perhaps the witnesses can assist me but my understanding is that any data I put onto my page is something I own and over which I have control.  However, there is a second set of data.  The Data Protection Commissioner confirmed earlier that Facebook tracks individuals when they leave its site so there is another dataset; there is something that it captures on a user's activities once he or she leaves the Facebook environment.  Who owns that data?  Where is it stored?  Can the witnesses provide me with my data or users' data generally?  If so, are the two sets of data made readily available?  Who owns the second type of data, where is it stored and is it available?<\/p><p> We have been told that people are tracked after they leave Facebook.  Do the witnesses think that the company should continue to be allowed to do that?  Is it something that should be a regulated practice?  Is it something that we should look at regulating and prevent it.  I raise this issue with the witnesses because they are here, but I accept that Facebook is one of many and others effectively do the same thing.  There is a marketplace and companies need to go with the flow.<\/p><p> There was a discussion earlier about opting in and opting out.  Deputy Eamon Ryan focused on the issue.  From now on, should it be very clear that when a service is available that facilitates the company to provide the Facebook service through advertising, as it does without a paywall - and we accept that it must make money and the accounts have to stack up - but should there be an opt-in window?  From now on, should it any service that allows me to access all that information for free, that I know what I am opting into, so that I would know where my data goes, and what data goes, what it is likely to be used for, what silo it will go into and predict what might happen in future?  That would bring transparency into the interaction between user and company.  Then we would not have the concern about whatever nefarious activities are going on beneath the bonnet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#EE00300","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I will ask the witnesses to respond before bringing in other members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#FF00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523970000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked about the delay between the recommendations made in 2012 and the action to lock down the platform in 2014.  The bottom line is that we did take too long.  That is one of the mistakes we made.  However, it is also important to put it in context.  The Data Protection Commissioner spoke about this at some length.  The audit we underwent in 2011 and the follow-up in 2012 was quite comprehensive.  We received something like 60 recommendations that required a response from Facebook and in many instances significant modifications to our service.  This was one issue which was raised.  We did provide some additional education and the change in the location of controls for users to allow someone to share their information with an app developer but ultimately concluded after around 18 months that we should just turn that capacity off.  I wish that we had come to that conclusion sooner but, as the data commissioner noted, it was something of an iterative process.<br\/><br\/>The next question related to what action Facebook took after the article published by<i>The Guardian <\/i>in 2015.  We moved immediately to ban Kogan's app from the platform and to demand of him and anyone he gave the data to that they delete it.<\/p><p>We were told relatively quickly by Cambridge Analytica that it had complied and deleted the data.  However, the Chairman has hit immediately on another place where I think we did not do as well as we should have, which was that we took their word for it that they had deleted the data and we should not have done that.  We should have pursued that with an audit, which we are undertaking now as soon as the ICO permits us, and we should have notified the people who were affected.  We are now taking all of those steps, although I wish we had taken them in 2015.  We are taking them not only with respect to Cambridge Analytica, but we are going back and looking at all of the apps that are similarly situated, meaning they had access to large amounts of data prior to the change to the platform in 2014.  We are now going back and looking at all of those apps, seeing if any of them are engaging in any type of suspicious activity.  If they are, we will conduct a full audit, and if they have misused our data, we will tell the people affected.<\/p><p> I hope that answers the Chairman's questions about whether we ever confirmed or checked in 2015.  The answer is that we did not.

We believe we have a broader responsibility to the people who use Facebook.  We made mistakes, as the Chair and I were just discussing.

When someone goes to a website, they will find present on that website code from a number of different sites - it could be Google, Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook.  When someone is logged out or is not a Facebook user, the data that we get transmitted back to us from that code is quite limited and is mainly IP, the type of browser the person is using and things of that nature.

That now sits within a new settings area on our platform, given that, again, one of the criticisms we have faced in the past, on which we accept we need to make improvements, was that there were controls and settings but they were spread across the platform.  We have now brought them all together in one place, in the same place where a user will download his or her information, which is everything he or she has ever shared with us, he or she will also find ad preferences.  He or she can also access that from every single ad he or she ever sees on the platform.  It shows the user the interests we have appended to his or her profile, based on some of his or her activity off-platform, if he or she has not turned off third-party data.  The user can change those given that we might get it wrong.  We get stuff wrong all the time.

The questions that arise point to a situation whereby we have, in the past decade, come into contact with a whole new world.<\/p><p>To date, there has not been much regulation in this area.  It has been a case of trial and error and there have been abuses.  It is a bit like the wild west without the sheriff.  Now, the sheriff has arrived and has to try and get a grip on what is happening and to protect people.<\/p><p> I was shocked when I read that the information of 87 million users had been utilised.  In the case of Ireland, there were just 15 people who had tapped into that app yet it affected over 44,000 citizens here.  That just goes to show the ripple effect.  In reality, the investigation came about because of the media in Britain and not as a result of any internal process that Facebook had in place.  I disagree with self-regulatory structures but there was some onus on Facebook to take responsibility for the fact that it was holding all this data belonging to people.  Could the witnesses clarify the position in that regard?<\/p><p> On the commodification and collection of information and its use, Facebook's business model is based on advertising and collecting data in order to be able to match people up to advertising.  Is there not always a danger that the temptation is there to abuse this, particularly in the political context?  I refer here, for example, to the most recent US presidential election or, a matter of some concern to this island, Brexit.  We are facing into a referendum on what is, to put it mildly, a fairly hot topic.  There is huge concern regarding the manipulation of information in that regard.  The witnesses mentioned that they are about to make some changes.  I ask them to make said changes, particularly those relating to advertising, tomorrow.  Who pays for advertising?  If I pay for an advertisement in the local press or wherever, it is identified straight away.  If I put up a political poster on a lamppost, the identify of the director of elections must be listed at the bottom.  That is a very simple thing.  I implore Facebook to do something similar.  People may argue about whether it happened in the context of Brexit or in the US.  We all have our own views about it at this stage.  There certainly is strong evidence to show that it did happen but the jury is still out.  This country is facing into a referendum at a time when 2.5 million citizens on this part of the island alone access Facebook each day.  Almost 3.5 million people throughout the Thirty-two Counties access Facebook.  The witnesses might clarify matters in this regard.<\/p><p> We need to develop a body of law in respect of social media in order to protect the right to privacy and to protect people in the context of the huge power that corporations possess.  In particular, there is a need to protect freedom of expression.  In terms of the witnesses' company, how firm is it in its objection to very strict laws being introduced in individual states?  What happens on the other side of the Atlantic may be one thing, but what happens on this side may be quite different.<\/p><p> Fake accounts are a real problem.  If I seek to insure my car, I have to show that I am the owner of the car.  If I go to tax the car, I have to do the same thing.  If I open a bank account, I have to show proof of identity.  This is all very basic.  I am aware of a few fake accounts.  Most of us involved in political life have been the victims of fake accounts at one time or another.  Social media can be a very good platform for citizens to participate.  However, there is huge abuse of it.  I am aware of some fake accounts that are putting up information about people who are in public life.  There is absolutely no protection.  Related to that is the whole question of the stage at which Facebook intervenes and says that what has been put up about X or Y is beyond the pale and that it is going to intervene and take it down.  In fairness, people do not mind a bit of robust political exchange but when the latter oversteps that mark, it takes away from the benefits of social media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#HH01900","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  Facebook is a very profitable global corporation that has a huge say in respect of social media and with regard to how people think and communicate across the globe.  The company has a community, as the witnesses call it, of over 2 billion.  Its headquarters are here in Dublin, presumably because it is able to make use of transfer pricing and various mechanisms to offset its tax against, for example, research and development.  Ireland has been known for helping global corporations to portray what are actually not their real profits.  A company will already have priced away some of its profit but actually portrays much of it as expenses and pays a great deal less tax than would be the case in other countries.  Having its main office in Dublin is really important to Facebook in the context of being able to avail of all of this.<\/p> <p>  Facebook has made massive profits out of people's personal data.  While the witnesses have said that they are sorry and that mistakes have been made, there is a big list in front of them regarding all the matters about which they have been asked by the Chair and other members as to why or how particular things happened.  It is very difficult for political representatives such as ourselves to trust the witnesses, particularly in the context of both the company's record and the sudden Damascene conversion that has occurred.  Our guests have indicated that the company is not going to allow certain things to happen again, that it will ensure that there is full transparency and that data will never be used or abused in the way it has been in the past.  It is really difficult for any of us to accept that at face value.<\/p> <p>  Although it was not in their original submission, I welcome the fact that the witnesses have announced that Facebook will roll out the transparency tools to users in Ireland on 25 April next.  The implications of the misuse of people's personal data in the political context of the referendum on the eighth amendment of the Constitution and abortion rights could still be very big indeed.  Advertising companies can prey on people's attitudes and their sexuality.  There is a great deal of information that people still do not realise Facebook and others can gain about them just because they are advertising stuff.  Political advertising in this regard is totally unregulated at present but it will be regulated in the very near future, just in time for the referendum on 25 May.  I welcome the fact that Facebook is going to allow transparency tools to be used in Ireland and I think it should do so tomorrow rather than on 25 April.  What is happening now indicates that the company recognises that there is a problem with political advertising and the way data is used to manipulate people's political ideas and responses, particularly if they respond to shocking images, are sensitive to certain images, etc.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that matter.  Do they recognise it as a problem?  Why did the company suddenly decide to allow the transparency tools to be rolled out - there is no mention of this in the original submission - a few weeks prior to the referendum?  What changed its mind?  Has Facebook been coming under pressure?  Why has it decided to roll out the tools not just in Canada but also here?<\/p> <p>  Many of the questions I was going to ask have already been posed.  It should be noted that our concern is that a former key employee of Cambridge Analytica is being used by the \"No\" side of the referendum campaign to do political advertising for them.  That has implications and gives rise to concern regarding the independence of that campaign.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#KK00100","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>At the outset, if the Chair will indulge me for 30 seconds I want to congratulate the colleague on my right, Deputy Lawlor, on his excellent and timely legislation.  In the context of this discussion, it is extraordinarily relevant.<\/p> <p>  I welcome our guests.  I note at the outset that during the celebrated hearings in the USA, when the witnesses' CEO Mark Zuckerberg was asked by an Illinois Democrat if he would want the name of the hotel he stayed in the previous night to be made public, he said that he absolutely would not.  Reasonably so.  That captured the difficulty that people face and how people feel.  It is a very serious issue.  My questions will be comments as well as questions, but they are nonetheless relevant.  None of us should fail to express this important view today.  The use of data to manipulate or distort democracy has horrendous consequences.  We can see the failure or breakdown of democracy, the shocking things it has led to in recent times in Europe and the absence of democracy in so many parts of the world.  This leads to awful horror.  To break down or threaten democracy, even by these subtle and sinister methods, is of horrendous seriousness.  Our guests have an extraordinary responsibility in that regard, given their access to 2 billion people. <\/p> <p>  I share the point raised by Deputy Smith.  It is very important.  I know the witnesses have said that Facebook will put in protections but I would like them to comment on that again.  We want an open, transparent and sensitive debate in the upcoming referendum.  Everybody aspires to that.  However, we need absolute assurance, and the people watching this today need to know, that there will be no distortion there.  The witnesses must convincingly say to us that there will not be.  I ask them to explain again, in layman's terms for those of us who are less technologically proficient, precisely how that will be achieved and how people will be so assured.  <\/p> <p>  Again, the same applies to future elections.  I understand that the commercial premise by which Facebook functions is that it provides names and information and thereby potential access for advertisers.  That is how our witnesses pay their bills.  That is a reasonable proposition.  At the same time, the fact that this could be distorted or used wrongfully is not acceptable.  Can the witnesses tell me how Facebook can allow people to be sure they have prevented the use of their data in an accessible and easily understood way?   I do think that we should have the option to opt out.  That point has been raised.  The witnesses have said that in light of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, Facebook will be going down that road.  It is very important for people to have that right.<\/p> <p>   I want to mention fake accounts.  I was personally a victim of this during an election campaign, and I know very few colleagues who were not.  Thanks be to God I had the strength of mind and the capacity to deal with it and not be affected, but I know some colleagues on whom it had much more adverse affects.  This concerns colleagues across the board.  It does not relate to any ideology or party.  This is about people and our human sensitivities.  The use of fake accounts is a horror, and it really needs policing.  People watching today need real reassurance on that score.<\/p> <p>  They also need real reassurance that if any advertising is directed at them they know where it is coming from and why, especially in the political case.  This issue was mentioned earlier when the Data Protection Commissioner was here.  In the case of posters, there are names and sources displayed, and the director of elections is written on the poster.<\/p><p>In the case of radio and television, under the Broadcasting Acts there is no specific political advertising.  It is a shocking difficulty.  There is nobody who would suggest for a moment that Facebook should not do business.  We understand that the witnesses should do their job, that they have to pay their bills and that the company has to function.  That is not the issue.  The issue is how that process works out in practice.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#LL00100","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523970000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>As each of the last round of questioners at some point touched on elections and fake accounts, maybe I will start there and hopefully will cover all those concerns.  The changes that we are making with the \"view ads\" tool are the first phase of the transparency tools that we have announced.  In response to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, I certainly understand the frustration and the desire that those should be out as quickly as possible - we would make them available tomorrow if we could.  These things take time to develop and implement.<\/p> <p>  We are accelerating the deployment of the \"view ads\" tool in Ireland as quickly as we can.  It is not going to roll out globally until some time later this spring or early summer, probably in mid-June.  Because of the results in Canada, and the fact that the tests there had progressed to such a point that we had confidence that we could deploy it here a month before the referendum and do it in a way that it would work, we made the decision only in recent days to accelerate and include Ireland as part of the pilot programme.  It will be the second and the only other country where we roll out the tool before the global deployment. <\/p> <p>  Overall, we certainly appreciate the concerns about interference in elections, distortion of the democratic process and the role that fake accounts can play in that process.  We learned a lot as a result of the 2016 US elections and Brexit.  We have devoted tremendous resources, in terms of both personnel and development of technology, to addressing some of the concerns that manifested themselves in those elections.  In 2018 we are doubling the number of people dedicated to safety and security from 10,000 to more than 20,000, with a big focus on election integrity.  We are investing in artificial intelligence tools, in particular ones that can help us identify and remove fake accounts before they are even uploaded onto the site or have a presence on it.  <\/p> <p>  There have been a number of big elections since the US election including the French election, the German election and the election in the US state of Alabama.  In each of those elections, we put together an internal task force with representatives across the company that was dedicated to doing everything we could to detect interference, in particular foreign interference.  We have had good results.  In the French election, we were able to detect and remove tens of thousands of politically motivated fake accounts.  We had similar good results in Germany.  In Alabama, which was a very controversial and hotly contested election in the United States, we were able to deploy the same type of task force, and identified a number of Macedonian fake accounts.  We believe they were more financially than politically motivated but we removed those as well. <\/p> <p>  We stood up a task force like that for the upcoming referendum.  We will be deploying the artificial intelligence technologies we have developed to try to detect those fake accounts as quickly as we can.  We detect literally millions a day and remove them before they are ever seen on the site.  We need to continually improve that capability and make the investments to do so, and that is what we are doing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joel Kaplan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523970000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>There are two types of fake account problem.  There is the one that Mr. Kaplan has just described, the kind of activity we discovered subsequent to the 2016 US Presidential election, which is usually one person or a number of people creating a series of fake accounts that all operate in tandem.  The way our technology works in identifying those is that usually, they are created and deployed at the same time and spread the same information at almost exactly the same time.  Those kinds of signals and triggers allow us to detect them.  Often, using those bots is how people spread misinformation at scale.<\/p><p>Let me stress that not all bots are bad.  Other cases were highlighted and Senator O'Reilly mentioned that he had been a victim of a fake account.  One must be who one says one is on Facebook.  We have an authentic identification policy, it means that one must go by the name that one's friends and family recognise as you.  We rely in large part on people reporting to us when people do not adhere to that.  Sometimes it is really obvious and one would know that the name is not real.  In other cases it may be that they have set up an account for trolling purposes.  If that is reported to us we can detect it.  I stress we do not always get it right.<\/p><p> There are also impersonating accounts, I know that sometimes that can affect public figures, whereby somebody purports to be that person online.  If that is reported to us we can detect it pretty quickly and we know that Deputy Timmy Dooley is Timmy Dooley and there is only one Deputy Timmy Dooley.  Equally, the commissioner, Ms Dixon, referred to facial recognition, which is a technology we do not currently use in Europe.  I think most people would be aware that under GDPR, people would be given a choice as to whether they want to opt in, so as Deputy Dooley said, it is very much on an opt-in basis and again that is a very effective security tool for people.  If one opts in, any time a photograph in which one is included is uploaded on to the platform, one is alerted to that fact.  I think that will do a lot for those who decide to opt in.  Other people will not be comfortable with the technology used in order to make that service available.  As we are dealing with those two problems in tandem, we rely a great deal on user reports.  If one is operating a page, the administrator of that page must be a real account, that is, a real person who is the person he or she says he or she is.  We are conscious of that as well in the context of the referendum.  While Deputy Lawless rightly points that there is an absence of applicable law when it comes to campaigning in the online space, we are conscious of how sensitive this is for people and have been thinking about it for a long time.  We have met personnel from the Transparent Referendum Initiative, TRI, and I wish to acknowledge Ms Liz Carolan, who is present today.  We welcome what they are doing.  Anything that brings greater transparency to this process is a good thing.  We have not been able to address all of their concerns - and I admit that upfront - but what we have done is to try to open up a dedicated channel of communications so that if there is anything that is surfaced to them or they encounter, they can surface it to us and we take a wider look at those issues when they are surfaced to us.  Consequently, they might come to us with one issue but we take a look at a page in the round to make sure that its administrators are legitimate actors on the platform.<\/p><p> It is worth spelling out what the \"view ads\" tool is and what it is not.  We understand that a number of issues need to be addressed with our political transparency tools for advertisements.  As Mr. Kaplan outlined, \"view ads\" is the very first step in a series of steps to bring greater transparency to online advertisements.  To explain, if one is served an advertisement or if one goes to a page, one will be able to click on the tool and see all the advertisements which that particular advertiser is running at that moment in one's jurisdiction.  If a particular campaign group is running an advertisement in Ireland, one will be able to click on it and see all the advertisements it is running at that particular time.  What that is supposed to address is the issue of micro-targeting or so-called dark advertisements, whereby I am being targeted because I am a woman in my 30s who is from an urban area while somebody else is being targeted because he is a man in his 60s and is from a rural area.  One is trying to target people with different messaging.  It is supposed to bring greater transparency to that.  We hope it will.  Of course, it does not address all of the concerns that people have.<\/p><p> The other things we have announced will take time to build and roll out.  I acknowledge that it is not of any great comfort to people when I say it takes time to build them and roll them out but unfortunately, that is where we find ourselves.  One such measure is that one will need to say who has paid for an advertisement.  We need to build the functionality for people to be able to build that into their political advertisements.  Another is that one will need to verify who one is as a political advertiser whereby if one is running political or issues-based advertisements of national significance, one will need to be verified.  That is quite tricky to deploy and it will have to be different in every country because there will be different systems and different vendors in place.  The other element is slipping my mind at this exact moment in time. <\/p><p> We are rolling out these systems over time.  This is the first one, as Mr. Kaplan said, and we are adding Ireland to the pilot on 25 April.  Obviously that will be with a four-week run into the referendum but there are other things we still need to do and we are working on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#MM00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Sweeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Chairman, may I ask a question on the same theme?

That is progress and it is very welcome.  It is good to see it.  A number of my questions will be about the feasibility technically of meeting the requirements of my legislation and I suppose the witnesses have answered that in one sense because of the things that Facebook is doing voluntarily.  Obviously it is possible.  I had hoped it would go further and as Deputy Smith has just mentioned, I had anticipated perhaps that it would because the core of my legislation is the transparency notice, it is great to see what other advertisements are being run by the same page and it is great to be aware of the dark advertisements.  I think that may have been available already in some cases, but it is important to be able to see who published the response of the advertisement.  I know Ms Sweeney mentioned the difficulty in identifying an issue-based advertisement as opposed to a candidate-based advertisement because usually the candidate is front and centre so that one cannot miss it, so James Lawless is always smiling at you from Facebook.  The issue-based advertisements can be more nuanced.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  How technically feasible is it to address this?  I understand that Facebook is working on it.  I understand it is in pilot, if not in Canada or another jurisdiction, at least in the laboratory.  Will Ms Sweeney confirm if that is so?  How far away is Facebook away from being able to do that?  In essence the provisions in the Bill  - my understanding from a previous conversation is that if one does not see any real technical difficulties it is a case of rolling out the pilot.  It would be great if they could confirm that it is just a case of rolling them out.<\/p> <p>  The second question I have is around the dataset.  I appreciate and acknowledge the note sounded in the opening statement and indeed the note that Mark Zuckerberg struck last week.  I am aware that Facebook is not a charity, that while it did some good work and some good activities and some philanthropy to an extent, the essence of the organisation is not philanthropic.  That is not why Facebook is in existence.  Facebook is a company, a corporate entity and it exists to make money.  That is fine.  There is nothing intrinsically wrong with that.  That is what most businesses do, but if people do not pay to use Facebook - advertisers do but the general public, the 200 million or whatever number of users are on it do not - is data a revenue stream?  <\/p> <p>  Has Facebook ever sold data to third parties?  On a second and related theme, how many categories of data does Facebook keep for metadata use?  I have heard the figure of 96 categories and I do not know if that is accurate or not.  It seems like a large metadata set so will the witnesses respond to those questions?<\/p> <p>  The third question relates to Cambridge Analytica. Earlier today we heard from the Data Protection Commissioner, Ms Dixon, who set out the Irish context and what is being addressed there.  We had a number of questions about that as well because it was the Irish Data Protection Office that responded to the Max Schrems complaint in 2012.  It is a good thought borne out by a lot of evidence that if the ruling of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner had been followed through in 2012, then the Kogan app could not have exploited the loophole and Cambridge Analytica could not have accessed the data.  If we extend that to its logical conclusion, Britain might still be in the European Union and Donald Trump might still be in the hotel business.  How do the witnesses respond to that scenario?  The key question is why did Facebook not act sooner.  I appreciate that we have been over that ground already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#OO00300","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Mark Zuckerberg might not know his suite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#OO00400","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1523970000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Indeed not and we would not be here and we would be doing something else.

Much of commentary stressed that it is tip of the iceberg; it is the one app we know about but it is the unknown unknowns and the known unknowns that are the ones that get us.  I appreciate that the witnesses supplied information in the opening statement about the Kogan app, but how many other apps have scraped or taken or improperly accessed data from Irish and worldwide users?  I understand the figures are pretty high and it is pretty close to almost the entire data set.  I would greatly appreciate an answer to that.<\/p> <p>  Given that we touched on GDPR coming into force in five weeks time, my understanding is that Instagram is not yet GDPR compliant and one cannot download one's dataset but I presume that will be done before 25 May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#OO00500","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1523970000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>The witnesses might just confirm that.<\/p><p>Mention was made in some media reports that Facebook executives used to communicate with each other and then delete or wipe messages from their internal messaging within Facebook Messenger.

Many apps and platforms have developed for it and it has been embraced by users to the point where it has become a 24\/7 feature of most people's lives.  Political advertising and issue-based discussions are very much part of that.  Controversies, threads and arguments are part of the whole package.  It is hard to understand, given the resources, data and knowledge available to it, that Facebook did not know about Russian interference in the US elections, Brexit and, as we saw on Channel 4, other processes around the world.  How is that credible?  It is hard to believe Facebook had no inkling that any of this was going on.  I would like to believe it, but it is hard to credit that Facebook was in complete ignorance of these activities and only found out when Channel 4 did some digging around and came back to tell it what had been happening on its platform for the last number of years.

I thank Mr. Kaplan and Ms Sweeney.  Mr. Kaplan is very welcome to Europe.  This democratic republic is part of Europe.  I was thinking about some of the names mentioned earlier.  I am a former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and I remember sitting on the EU Council with Viviane Reding for four years.  She is a formidable and powerful woman.  That power in Europe to set standards is very important and rightly in place.  It has been one of the proud records of our Union.  At Council meetings, there were only 27 people around the table but in private session some were saying they wanted Facebook shut down.  That was never the Irish position.  We are hugely supportive of companies like Facebook, not just because its large headquarters is based here, but also because we are a modern, forward-looking country which embraces the digital revolution, openness and democratic engagement.  Shutting things down is sometimes too much on the attack side.  We have always stood up for co-operation between US multinationals and Europe.<\/p><p>My experience in Europe has also involved working with the likes of Jan Philipp Albrecht, a Green colleague who was centrally involved in the European Parliament in the development of the GDPR.  He is a brilliant parliamentarian.  It was Parliament which drove standards in recent times, moreso than the Council or the Commission.  There is real strength in that.  It is a cross-party institution and it unites Europe left, right, green and liberal on the need for standards.  Facebook is facing a Europe which is not divided on this issue but is rather united absolutely in the European Parliament.  Having worked on these issues for ten or 15 years, I reflect also on the real strength in the likes of Digital Rights Ireland and Max Schrems who have done a real service to public policy by asking awkward questions and raising high standards.  Some might see it as being difficult, but to my mind, they have done it out of a strong ideal about what the revolution could bring.  They have done a real service and our party very much supports and recognises the work they have done in the courts and elsewhere.<\/p><p>Deputy Dooley quoted someone from Facebook earlier.  I quote from the boss, as it were, Mr. Zuckerberg, and his address on 16 February 2017:<\/p><blockquote><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">To our community,<\/font><br \/><br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">On our journey to connect the world, we often discuss products we're building and updates on our business.  Today I want to focus on the most important question of all: are we building the world we all want?<\/font><\/blockquote> <p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">It is the right question.  My first answer, however, is that I do not want to live in a world of surveillance.  I do not want anyone to have surveillance or control over me, be it a state or private entity.  That is what the issue of privacy and the need to protect data rights are about.  This revolution is only at the beginning.  We need it to evolve so that we embrace the Internet of things and do all the management required to protect our environment, improve our health service and obtain all of the other efficiencies we can gain from digital systems.<\/font><\/p><p>We cannot do that if we do not have trust and the fundamental building blocks needed around the use of our data.  We cannot convince our people to share data if they think it is being used for exploitation, which is why this issue is important.  This is important for every committee of the Houses, including the energy, health and education committees.  If we do not get the building blocks and basic rules for data use right, we will not get all of the benefits from the digital revolution that is evolving.  It is as significant as that.  It is one of the most important public policy issues we face.<\/p><p> As I said to the Data Protection Commissioner earlier, I recognise that time is very short here.  I wish we had the five hours Mr. Zuckerberg had before Congress and elsewhere.  Recognising that, I will provide 20 questions in writing to which I request a written response.  I will ask a couple of them now, however, reflecting on some of what we have heard.  As time is tight, a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer will be appropriate in some cases.  These are some of the questions people in Europe are now asking about Facebook.<\/p><p> Facebook's opening presentation set out that the company engages with the Data Protection Commissioner on new products and how things are working.  In that consultation, are there discussions around the new face recognition services which are about to be offered by Facebook in the EU?  I understand the new policy is based on an opt-in to facial recognition to inform Facebook users that their faces have appeared in photos uploaded by other users.  Does that mean Facebook will index all facial profiles on any photo uploaded, regardless of any consent by any person depicted?  More specifically, will Facebook refrain from analysing any photograph uploaded by any user for biometric data on persons depicted in those photos until it has received an opt-in from every person depicted in those photos?

Why not make each setting a choice before a profile is functional?  Why do privacy settings continue to focus on what friends can and cannot see?  I go back to what Ms Sweeney said.  When are we going to treat advertising settings as privacy settings so that there is that level of protection across all areas?  Will Facebook stop creating shadow profiles of people who have not registered a Facebook account and who have never given their consent to being tracked?<\/p> <p>  Why did Facebook not contact the Irish Data Protection Commissioner in 2015 when it became aware of the controversy regarding Cambridge Analytica and the breach of data, given that it had been a point of real contention between Facebook and the Commissioner?  Section 702 of FISA was recently reauthorised.  In its referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union, the High Court stated as a factual finding that mass surveillance by US authorities continues to take place.  Is Facebook preparing for a situation where the EU-US privacy shield is declared invalid?

I ask, therefore, if I can do follow-up questions also.<\/p><p>Specifically, I want to pick up on what specific measures are being putting in place in relation to article 9 and the processing of special categories of data.  To be clear, we are not simply talking about special categories of data, that is, political views, religious views and sexual orientation that people might put in their profile but that which might be revealed by the actions that they are taking online and in their profile.  It is important that we are very clear that it is what one does and says and what might be deduced from that.  Is there any danger of any of that kind of data being included, for example, in the observed data that is being discussed?  I think Deputy Dooley spoke about that.  I refer to the question of that observed data and that clarity over who owns it, how it can be used and how it can be targeted.  Is it linkable back, or is it linked back to individual accounts?<\/p><p> I refer to the facial recognition and specifically that question around the opt-in.  If persons were to opt in in the way that was suggested, would that photograph still only be used by the user or can it be accessed or used by third parties by virtue of that opt-in?  There is a concern around whether is it proportionate in terms of the purpose of the opt-in.<\/p><p> There is also a concern, which I know was mentioned to the American Senators on the judiciary committee, that they could expect GDPR-type regulation, but as far as I know, automatic privacy settings and automatic opt-out does not seem to be on offer to them, so maybe there is an inconsistency there.  On that question of automatic highest-level privacy settings, can the witness guarantee that that will be the default?<\/p><p> The witness mentioned the question of data breaches.  It is a crucial question as to why those whose data was breached were not informed.  Is that now going to be a policy for any future data breaches?<\/p><p> This is my final point but it is very important.  I, along with Deputy Ryan and others, wrote to ask that these optional tools be rolled out early, although I believe the regulation we need is such as Deputy Lawless has proposed.  I was delighted when I heard initially about view ads but I am extremely disappointed to hear that those who purchased the ads will not be here.  We are not talking about content; we are talking about commercial content.  Payments are being accepting, commercial activity is taking place and ads are being sold now.  We know that in the US, of the five million ads that were examined over a six week stretch, over half of the advertisers were not registered anywhere or findable online.  In an initial work by Transparency Referendum and others, we know there are multiple actors, which are not registered anywhere, are not findable online and are effectively anonymous and which are putting ads up currently in relation to the referendum, and indeed there are international advertisers as well.  There are situations where individuals' images have been used by the opposite side in the referendum in advertisements, that pictures have been taken from Facebook without their permission and that does not seem to have been responded to.

I believe that was the question.  It is a very astute question because that is exactly the issue we are struggling with and that we are trying to solve.  A couple of months ago we started trying to build the transparency tools for electoral ads because that is easier for the artificial intelligence to detect - for instance, discussion of a candidate's name.  Discussion of issues and issue ads come in such varied form and involve familiarity and understanding of the nuance and the context involved.  The state of artificial intelligence and machine learning is still developing.  With the combination of artificial intelligence and the significant investment in resources in hiring, literally, thousands more people just to focus on this question, we think we will be able to review and capture most issue ads.  Artificial intelligence may not detect some which are classifiers and we will have to rely on our users to report them and then have the manual reviewers address that.<\/p><p>That is why this takes some time.

I think it is worth dwelling on that for just one second.  When one is an advertiser advertising on Facebook, one does not know who it is one is targeting.  It could be based on location, on gender or on some of the interests that we have created buckets for, but it is all aggregated and it is all anonymised.  We know who a person is and that is why we will never sell a person's data, and that is a key point for us, but they do not.  I think that is an important point.

Digital Rights Ireland is also an important player in this space.  We have stepped up our engagement with it recently.  I think it is fair to say that we do not always agree, and it makes that very clear to us, but we try to at least engage.  One of the issues we have engaged on recently was facial recognition and in recent weeks, we outlined how we will be rolling out the option for people to opt in to that under GDPR.  It has made it clear to us that it does not agree with how it operates, but let me make a stab at explaining how it works, so the committee can give us its view on that.<\/p> <p>  If one does not opt in to facial recognition, we do not create a template of one's face and append that to one's profile.  When a photograph is uploaded with three people in it and facial recognition is turned on in respect of two of the people, in order to eliminate the other person, we have to scan the face, as such.  \"Eliminate\" is probably the wrong word but we need to do that in order to eliminate them from the photograph.  When we have eliminated them, we do not maintain any information about their facial or their biometric data.  There is nothing appended to their profile.  It is literally a process of elimination.  I know some privacy rights campaigners still take issue with that, and I recognise where they are coming from, but we see benefits, particularly from a security perspective, for people who might be victim to impersonating accounts.  It certainly puts paid to that straight away.<\/p> <p>  We have engage very closely with the Data Protection Commissioner on that issue.  In recent weeks it asked us for a paper setting out exactly how it works, mirroring a lot of the questions the Deputy have asked.  Obviously, the commissioner's office would have some additional technical knowledge on this matter.  We have set this out in a very detailed manner in writing to the commissioner and we are awaiting feedback on that matter.<\/p> <p>  There were several other questions.  We do not create shadow profiles.  That is one of those myths.  A shadow profile for those who may be familiar with it is the notion that if a person is a non-Facebook user, we collect data about a person and create a shadow profile, waiting for the day when this person creates an account.  That is not the case.  It is true that if one goes to a website that has some of our cookies or pixels embedded in it - the same website would have them for Google, LinkedIn or Twitter - it pings back information to us, as Mr. Kaplan described earlier, such as browser information as in the kind of browser one is using, whether it is Chrome or something else, and one's IP address.  It is similar to the way in which Internet profiles work and I am sure Deputy Ryan knows more about this than I do.  It is not that when it lands with us, and if we understand one is not a Facebook user, we hang on to it.  It is gone out of our system within a matter of days and that is an important point to flag as well.<\/p> <p>  On the notion of surveillance, that is very important to us as well.  We are signatories to the Reform Government Surveillance principles.  A lot of the big technology companies have signed up to that.  We work closely with law enforcement here and elsewhere on certain matters, particularly around child safety and child exploitation and lots of other pressing issues.  We have very particular protocols in place when it comes to requests from law enforcement.  The Department of Justice and Equality said it was going to initiate a wider review of our surveillance laws, via the Law Reform Commission and that would be a welcome development.  We are very alive to those issues and, as I said, the Reform Government Surveillance principles are something we stand behind.<\/p> <p>  On the reverse lookup, have we shut that down?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018041700002#TT00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Sweeney"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1523970000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Deputy James Lawless took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523970000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>We shut that down.

The committee has decided to divide the meeting into two different sessions.  We will now start the first session, the purpose of which is to have an engagement with a number of school principals on the topic to which I refer.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome our three guests.  We have before us Ms Muireann Carr, deputy principal of Ballinteer Educate Together national school.  I wish to point out that Deputy Catherine Martin, who had nominated the school, unfortunately has a family bereavement, but Senator Grace O'Sullivan is here in her stead.  We also have Mr. Brian Bergin, principal of St. Paul's secondary school, Monasterevin, County Kildare, which is the school I nominated.  Our third guest is Mr. Liam Burke, principal of Whitecross national school, Julianstown, County Meath, which Deputy Thomas Byrne nominated.  The format is that I will invite the witnesses to make brief opening statements of approximately three minutes' duration and these will be followed by engagement with members of the committee.  I thank the witnesses for their written submissions.<\/p><p>Before we begin, I wish to draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by me, as Chairman, to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise the witnesses that the opening statements they have made available to the committee will be published on our website after this meeting.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I now call on Ms Carr to make her opening statement on behalf of Ballinteer Educate Together national school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#E00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523975400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear.  My name is Muireann Carr and I am the deputy principal of Ballinteer Educate Together national school in Dublin 14.  I am making a statement and in attendance on behalf of Marie Gordon, who unfortunately cannot be here today.<\/p> <p>  Our school opened in 2012 with one junior infant class.  Now, in 2018, we have 11 classes, 275 pupils and a waiting list of more than 250 for our 60 places next year.  We will grow to a minimum of 335 pupils and a staff of at least 25 next year and we are currently located in the second of our temporary buildings.  For the first five years, we occupied a section of St. Tiernan's community school in Balally, Dublin 16.  The latter is a secondary school adjacent to our permanent location.  The classrooms and prefabs there were half the size of a primary classroom; one class in particular was in a converted locker room a quarter the size of a primary classroom.  Four learning support teachers worked with children with special educational needs in the lobby, divided by bookcases and notice boards.  The principal's office was constructed by our caretaker out of recycled plasterboard in a corner of the lobby.  We had no sports hall, so PE and sports were dependent entirely on the weather.  Most parents bought or rented houses and apartments in the area to be near a permanent location and now must travel much further to our current location.<\/p> <p>  Five years later, in August 2017, we were instructed by the Department to move everything to Notre Dame in Churchtown, Dublin 14.  This is a distance of approximately 3 km but traffic means the journey can take half an hour or more.  Many families, despite loving the school, have been compelled to move on to other schools.  This has had a knock-on effect on numbers in the school and the staffing schedule.  The bus transport section of the Department of Education and Skills will not provide transport for our displaced families even though we meet the required distances.  Approximately ten to 15 families have had to pay for a private bus at a cost of &euro;60 per child per month.  Many parents had to spend last summer searching for after-school facilities in the new area and organise extra childcare.  The impact of the delays in securing our permanent building include: the difficult educational environment for pupils, especially those with special educational needs; challenging work conditions for staff and the principal; the deflection of a principal's role from that of teaching and learning; a demoralising lack of communication and evidence of progress; extra financial costs for families; parents' feeling that their right to a school of their choosing is not being facilitated; logistical challenges; health and safety issues; the erosion of confidence in the Department; difficulty in embedding the school in the community due to moving and the lack of a definite long-term plan; the challenges for the board of management in dealing with a lack of communication and organising constant change, refurbishment and logistics; and the cost to the school of a second temporary refurbishment - for example, IT costs.  The board consequently needs to manage finances with great skill in order to deal with the extra costs associated with making the temporary accommodation fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>  From our school's perspective, the cause of the delays in constructing a school building appear to be: a lack of forward planning, which allowed a suitable building owned by the Department of Education and Skills to become landlocked over the course of 30 years; perhaps a lack of analysis of demographics and the consequent future need for a school in our area; and an apparent lack of joined-up planning involving one person or one section of the Department focusing on the project from the sanctioning of the school all the way to the completion of the construction.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee and I will be happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Muireann Carr"},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Carr.

My name is Brian Bergin.  I have been a teacher in St. Paul's secondary school since 2003.  I was appointed acting deputy principal in 2006 and principal in 2010.  I have been very fortunate in my position in that I have enjoyed the unwavering support of wonderful students, staff, community, board and parents, for which I am most grateful.<\/p> <p>  In 2005, 13 years ago, our school was named on a public private partnership, PPP, bundle of schools.  In February 2018, the Department informed us that we were profiled for construction to commence in the third quarter of 2019.  This would finally see the school completed in March 2021.  However, how can we reasonably expect this latest completion date to materialise after the events of the past 13 years, a period filled with excitement, expectation, hope, frustration and, latterly, anger and despair?  So many of the delays regarding our project have related to the identification and acquisition of a suitable site and the provision of services thereto.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions I would like addressed.  What role did the Department play in the selection of the site?  Did it carry out a feasibility study into the provision of services to the preferred site?  Why do unresolved legal issues remain in respect of the procurement of the preferred site?  Why did the size of the preferred site decrease by almost 50% from the original site identified despite the school being built for more students?  The Department is the client in this project, and we are very appreciative of that.  I understand that different sections of the building unit are responsible for different aspects of the each project.  Again, however, I have a few questions about this.  Who in the Department takes lead responsibility in such a project?  Who is responsible for ensuring timelines are met and co-ordinated between the various sections of the Department, with the design team, the local authority, the statutory bodies and, most importantly, the school?  Is there a more time-efficient and financially accountable way of making developmental decisions at critical stages with critical stakeholders?  As the financing of the project comes from central government, through taxpayers' contributions, why does it appear to be a game of which government agency will pay at each juncture?<\/p> <p>  Throughout this journey, I have worked with wonderful professionals who have done sterling work to progress the project to this point.  Having submitted the stage 2B report last week, we are now at a point at which the Department can expedite our project.<\/p><p>They can do this by ensuring they give it the utmost attention, the benefit of their expertise, and the financial resources to progress to tender in a timely and efficient manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Bergin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523975400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Whitecross School is situated 8 km south of Drogheda.  In 2002 I began as school principal in Whitecross.  We had six teachers and 171 pupils at that time. There are now more than 430 pupils and 23 teachers.  House building projects were beginning in the Julianstown and south Drogheda area by 2004.  Our numbers were rising and it was evident that with four suitable classrooms and two unsuitable classrooms our school would need to get on the building ladder.  Between 2004 and up to the present the board and I have highlighted the very unsatisfactory working conditions for staff and pupils.  We have met and written to several public representatives.  We have met with two education Ministers.  We have lobbied and lobbied, but we still do not have our building.<br\/><br\/>As for the present conditions, there are 26 external doors on our collection of buildings.Anyone has open access to the school, from a very busy main road; the school cannot be locked down.  <br\/><br\/>On three occasions rats - not mice - were caught within school buildings.  I personally dispatched one on the latest occasion, which occurred in the least suitable prefab block on the campus, during class time in a bathroom between two classrooms.  An even more serious incident occurred last year when a storage heater fell off a wall in first class, in the same classroom.  This happened just after the children left the room.  The heater weighs some 200 kg.<br\/><br\/>Continual maintenance and IT issues have to be addressed.  Heating bills are astronomical as each prefab has its own system with no central control.  There is <i>ad hoc<\/i>wiring in most classrooms to cater for increased IT and system needs.  We are in limbo when it comes to upgrading or even maintaining school facilities as we are continually expecting the project to begin.  The board cannot justify spending funds on upgrades for a building that is due to be revamped.  Pupils and teachers often have to go to classrooms in wet or cold weather for classes.  This is particularly the case for special needs pupils.  In fact, I feel pupils and staff in Whitecross can justifiably feel discriminated against in comparison to pupils and staff in all other schools in our locality.  <br\/><br\/>There is no formal staff room; we use a learning support room during break which has to cater for up to 30 staff in a room of 20 square metres.  Neither is there a formal meeting room for teachers, parents, social workers or inspectors.  <br\/><br\/>Of the 16 classrooms in the school I deem only four suitable to deliver the present national curriculum for primary schools.  <br\/><br\/>We pride ourselves on success in sport at Whitecross, yet we do not have any indoor facilities appropriate to delivering the PE curriculum.  This was a particular issue during the very poor weather in recent months.<br\/><br\/>Several neighbouring schools were completed in the past ten years within 10.km of Drogheda, including Stamullen national school, Donacarney Boys and Girls, Duleek Boys and Girls, Scoil an Brad&aacute;n Feasa, Le Ch&eacute;ile in Mornington, St. Mary&rsquo;s Parish primary school and Scoil Oilibh&eacute;ir Naofa in Bettystown, to name a few.  Some of the above schools did not exist when we were originally approved as a major building project.  All bar two were behind us on any building ladder, if such a thing exists.  It seems to have escaped Department officials that the board was tasked with assessing and picking a design team in 2008 for a building project, only for all communication with DES officials from Whitecross to be ignored for months on end.  Eventually we found this project was parked due to the recession.  One would imagine that our project would then be fast-tracked for round two, but this has not been the case.  <br\/><br\/>The harder the board and I worked to get the project off the ground the less progress we seemed to make.  In November 2016 the design team met in Tullamore.  The meeting began with a senior Department official criticising Whitecross board members for sharing the history of the schools&rsquo; endeavours to get the project off the ground with local politicians.  The board members present found these comments unacceptable and out of order, but we kept quiet in order not to cause further delay to the project.  We have ten prefabs, six of which cost the state &euro;80,000 per annum.  The total cost of temporary accommodation to date is over &euro;1.5 million.  The initial price projection for this project in 2011 was &euro;2.9 million.  Currently the estimated cost is &euro;5.7 million, due to the delay, and I am sure the spend will double before completion.  <br\/><br\/>In March, Whitecross hosted 24 teachers from Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Norway.  I was embarrassed having to show these teachers the conditions our pupils and teachers have to put up with, given that Ireland is supposed to be one of the wealthier EU countries, and the fact that all these European teachers worked in much safer and more fit for purpose schools than we do.<br\/><br\/>All the recent talk in education circles is Children First.  As far as I can see it, children are put last in Whitecross School.  What difference will my attendance make in progressing the project that our pupils and teachers deserve?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>The three witnesses have described very challenging sets of conditions for the students in their care, and for the staff working in those schools.

The presentations we heard made this a very worthwhile exercise.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to mention Gaelscoil Chnoc Laimhna in Knocklyon.  Some parents of children at that school are in the Gallery today.  Deputy Martin and my Green Party colleague, Francis Duffy, have been working with them to secure a permanent building for that school.  It has been in prefabs for 22 years, and a representative was on Drivetime during the week describing horrific conditions.  Thanks to Ms Carr, Mr. Burke and Mr. Bergin for their presentations.  It is horrifying to listen, in this day and age, to stories of how the economy is growing while the conditions described exist.  I admire the persistence and dedication of the witnesses, who are operating under sub-standard conditions.  <\/p> <p>  In the short term, what do each of the schools need to ease the stress of the temporary accommodation?  In terms of communications with the Department of Education and Skills, do they feel that the lines of communication are good enough or effective?  There have been issues in terms of communication for Ballinteer Educate Together; I understand that announcements about the school were made on Twitter before the school itself was informed.  Have communications with the Department improved since the Twitter announcement?  Do the schools feel there is an end in sight to the saga that they, their pupils and the families involved have been involved in?  How are the schools managing to keep the parents calm?  The witnesses must be very frustrated with the whole system and the lack of development.  <\/p> <p>  We have heard the problems associated with the schools represented here.

I never paid much attention to the impact of that when I dropped her to the prefab and it was only when they moved into the school last year that I could see what the students were missing.  I had not tuned in to the impact the temporary accommodation might be having on them.  However, when they moved into the school they had access to a hall and could invite parents, and the community, to school plays and concerts to be part of that because they had the space.  They also had space for a library in the school, which they did not have previously.  I had not thought about any of that at the time.<\/p> <p>  Ms Carr spoke about the difficult educational environment for pupils.

I am glad the witnesses came before the committee to tell those stories, one of which has been going on for 13 years.  There is nothing like hearing at first hand the circumstances in which people find themselves.  This is an issue the committee should prioritise because there is little point in members talking about the benefits of education and the great education system we have if we do not have adequate conditions for children in schools.<\/p> <p>  I fully agree with what Mr. Burke said about children being last.  Time and again here I speak about cases where we are failing children.  All of us talk about the past and how badly children were treated in the industrial schools yet we seem to be continuing in the same way.  It is as though children do not matter.<\/p> <p>  I believe school is very difficult for many children.  It is difficult for parents to send their children to school if they issues to do with a learning difficulty or anxiety.  Sending children to schools where the conditions are inadequate is unacceptable.  I do not know how the witnesses have put up with them for so long and not closed up and protested at the gates until something was done about the conditions.  What is happening is unacceptable.

Listening to the three presentations I was struck by their passionate enthusiasm for the school community, the students they teach and the school staff.<\/p> <p>  I had the opportunity to talk to some of the staff in St. Paul's secondary school in Monasterevin about the impact this issue had on them, which Senator Ruane rightly pointed out.  Mr. Burke mentioned it also in his submission in terms of thanking the teachers for teaching in a Third World-type situation.  The same is true for the school in Monasterevin and, I have not doubt, for the school in Ballinteer.  Teachers do not have a place where they can correct copy books and must sit in a car to do that.  At the same time, there are 44 members of staff and there are only 17 car park spaces.  Of those 44 teachers, 43 of them must drive to get to the school so the cars cannot even park in the car park.  One could say that is only one part of the problem but when the teachers are dedicated to nurturing their students both in terms of the subjects they teach and the extracurricular subjects, it is very disheartening for them to have to do that in a cramped environment that has major health and safety implications.<\/p> <p>  As we know from the documentation we were presented with from Monasterevin, in 2004, the Department said the school was structurally unsound.  That was 14 years ago, and the school has almost twice the number of students now.  It has two cubicles for almost 200 boys.  One can imagine the impact of that on the young men and their parents, who have said their sons are afraid to go to the toilet during the school day.  That adds its own level of frustration in addition to the physical aspect.<\/p> <p>  There are many elements in the submissions the witnesses have presented.  I know the entire school community feels very let down in respect of commitments that have been made.<\/p> <p>  My next question is to do with all the schools.  Mr. Bergin asked a specific question about having a dedicated project manager, something we will put to the Department later.  I would like to hear the witnesses' experience of dealing with a dedicated project manager on all the issues.  We accept that issues sometimes come into play regarding planning, pipelines, as we know in terms of Irish Water, and so on.  However, once those are dealt with, I refer to other unavoidable delays that occur for which there is not a proper explanation and the issue of communication is crucial.  That was touched on previously regarding the timely communications the school would receive from the Department.  The witnesses also deal with the board, the school community and parents and it is crucial for them to be able to respond to all of those on the specifics in a timely and informed manner.<\/p> <p>  I will revert to the witnesses and they can make comments.  There will be an opportunity for everybody else to come in again at that point.

We have been in this process for 14 or 15 years and our staff are getting tired of the whole thing.  At the same time, our morale is still high.  The management team and I are responsible for that.

When our school moved to its second temporary campus we moved out of our original catchment area.  It was more than 3 km from where many of our parents lived.  The parent-teacher association, PTA, organised a bus that might help to facilitate those parents who had been displaced or who now had to travel to school from much farther away.  Each parent put an application in to see if they could get the bus, and even though enough applications were received, the bus would not be facilitated.  That was one issue we faced during the change from one temporary campus to another.<\/p> <p>  Senator Grace O'Sullivan asked what could be done to ease the stress and difficulty we would face in temporary accommodation.

It has been a rollercoaster of emotions for staff.  Initially there was excitement.  We showed them plans for their rooms and told them that we had received phone calls to say that something was going to happen soon, but since then there has been delay after delay and disappointment after disappointment.  Our staff has grown from 20 when we first featured in a list in 2005 to 44.  The school population has similarly grown by just over 100%.  Finding space to work is a difficulty in our school.  We just do not have the space to put on additional classes.  We have converted a storeroom to educate local programme refugees in a local hotel while they are on an orientation programme.  Heating prefabricated buildings is a nightmare.  They are roasting during summer and freezing during winter.  Some days the heating is on and some days it is off depending on whether a student hits a switch.  It is a credit to staff that they rise above the facility to deliver quality education for the students.  They are wonderful.  The students are also wonderful because they accept it.  It is sometimes embarrassing when staff take students away to other schools because they cannot believe the facilities those other schools have.  I am talking about local schools which were on the same list we were on in 2005.  They were built in 2010 or 2011.  At best our school will be built in 2021.

I want to make sure we will hold the officials to account.  While the issue is very personal, I am sure the same is true for the other schools.  St. Paul's secondary school's piece is important for all of south Kildare owing to the knock-on impact on surrounding towns and areas.

A number of us are due to attend a meeting tonight in our own area where the children attending the local school have been educated in prefabs for 22 years.  The pattern is similar to some of the stories that have been outlined, including the communication difficulties.  I know of a school in my constituency that was at the top of the list.  The building project was to move to construction the next year, but then it disappeared from the list and I have not been given an explanation.  I do not have one for the parents I shall meet tonight.  Neither do I have an explanation for the pupils, their parents and the teachers in the schools we are discussing.  There is something wrong when we, as elected representations, have not been given an explanation.  At one stage I was my party's spokesperson on education.  Other members have a background in education and so on.  It is a blank canvas when it comes to trying to find out where one's school is and whether there has been progress made.  The problem is not just that there is a lack of information or communication.  Can the delegates recommend to the committee ways by which the position can be imporoved?  What is the best way forward?  Everyone wants a silver bullet and to be told that their school project will go ahead or is on track, but it should not be like that.  The system should be fair, open and transparent.

Unfortunately, so much time has elapsed that their children are now in third level education or working.  In some cases, entire families and an entire school generation have left a school without any progress being made in the provision of new accommodation.

I am joined by the following colleagues from the Department&rsquo;s planning and building division: Ms Helen O&rsquo;Neill, our technical manager in the professional and technical section, and Mr. Brian Power, our principal officer in the forward planning section.<\/p> <p>  The Department has already provided the committee with a written submission on this topic.  Some key points to note from the submission are, first, the overall scale of the school building programme which, during the period 2010 to 2017, involved the completion of 365 large-scale projects, of which 218 were new school buildings, to provide of the order of 130,000 permanent school places.  In addition, more than 1,900 projects were completed during this period under the Department&rsquo;s additional accommodation scheme which resulted in the provision of almost 60,000 school places.<\/p> <p>  Second, new schools are large-scale projects that involve significant investment.  As an example, the cost of delivering a new 16-classroom primary school is of the order of &euro;6.5 million, excluding site costs, and of the order of &euro;22 million for a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school.  The planning and delivery of large-scale projects is managed as part of the multi-annual school building programme.  The delivery process for a new school typically involves site identification and acquisition prior to the appointment of a design team, progression through architectural design, including planning permission, and then tender and construction.<\/p> <p>  Third, throughout all stages of this delivery process, there are a range of factors and external dependencies outside the Department&rsquo;s control that can impact on delivery timelines on individual projects and the ability to achieve the Department&rsquo;s published indicative timelines for same.  Delays can occur in site acquisition, planning, design and construction.  The Department keeps in regular contact with schools regarding such matters.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, as part of ongoing efforts to improve and streamline information on its website, a single list has been published on the Department's website in county order that sets out the current status of all large-scale projects being delivered as part of the school building programme.  This list will be updated on a regular basis - every month - to reflect the progression of projects through architectural design, tender and construction as part of the &euro;8.4 billion investment in school buildings under the National Development Plan 2018-2027.<\/p> <p>  In its published work programme, the committee indicated that it wanted the Department&rsquo;s forward planning section to be part of the discussion on this topic.  The role of this section is to analyse demographic and enrolment trends and anticipate future demand for school places.  It uses a geographical information system, GIS, to assist it with this work.  Brian Power, principal officer, is available to talk to the members in more detail on the work of the forward planning section.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to invite the committee to the Department&rsquo;s planning and building division in Tullamore to see at first hand how new schools are planned and delivered, including getting an overview on the geographic information system that is used for planning school provision, and the delivery of school building projects and the various delivery mechanisms that are used for same.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to answer further questions arising and welcome discussion of the issues.  I am conscious that the representatives of three schools who were before the committee earlier raised issues about communication and contact and progression of their projects.  We can deal with that as part of questions from the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus"},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Loftus.

I thank him also for the offer to respond on the particular issues in the three schools because when I saw the submission from the Department I was disappointed that there was no reference to the three schools when they gave up their school day to attend to discuss the issues.

It concerns Mr. Loftus's presentation in which he said that the Department of Education and Skills is in regular contact with the schools.<\/p><p>That seems to be in direct conflict with the common experience of almost all of the schools that report that communication is a huge issue.  Can the delegates reconcile their experience with what they have said in their statement?<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Murphy's first question was whether the delegates understood the scepticism and anger of the parents, staff and students of the schools?  She referred, in particular, to Ballinteer Educate Together national school which has been without a permanent home for six years and Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna which has been located in prefabs for the past 22 years.  Do the delegates understand the frustration and hurt the parents, staff and students felt when the Minister announced 42 new schools, some of which are to open as early as next year?<\/p><p> Much of the submission deals with the issues of site acquisition and planning, to which I will return, but regardless of them, there is no excuse for poor communication.  Ballinteer Educate Together national school learned from a tweet that it was to move, as we heard in the earlier session.  It has been kept in the dark and is relying on public representatives to request information for it.  That should not be the case.  What measures are the delegates taking to ensure there are adequate lines of communication with schools to ensure they are not kept in the dark or do not learn important information from third parties?<\/p><p> On the issue of site acquisition, what steps is the Department taking to ensure the State lands gifted to religious bodies for community purposes will remain in use for those purposes?  That issue has arisen in Deputy Catherine Martin's constituency in Our Lady's Grove primary school in Goatstown.  In Senator Grace O'Sullivan's area of Waterford the Educate Together school in Tramore is facing being split on two sites, which would be impossible from a health and safety perspective.  That is happening while two existing school buildings, Stella Maris and the CBS, lie empty.  Are efforts being made to ensure compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers can be used in a fair manner to protect children's futures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#K00700","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I want to ask the fundamental question about the three schools.  What is the current position?  They have acknowledged communications, but most schools would overlook all of the past problems if they could get reliable information on when their projects would go ahead.<\/p><p>I have a number of other questions.  I ask one of the delegates to describe the geographic information system in more detail.  Is it a computer programme?  Is it based on the Haase index in the Department with responsibility for rural affairs, which is based on a system devised by a foreign academic, or what is it?  Is it something I can buy in a shop or just the way the Department looks at figures?  I want more detail on it.<\/p><p>Regarding some other school projects in my area, I have mentioned Scoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide<font color=\"#800000\"> <\/font>in Lismulln which is very similar to Whitecross national school in that it is mainly prefabs and has been on the list almost as long as it.  I would like to receive some information on the school.  I highlight how bad the conditions are in the school which, although in a rural area, is situated in an area of expansion in the hinterland of Navan.<\/p><p>I want to inquire about the position on three schools in Dunboyne, namely, Dunboyne junior and senior national schools and St. Peter's national school.  In the case of St. Peter's national school, has the site acquisition process been completed?<\/p><p>We have discussed Eureka secondary school previously.  A it is part of the Carillion set-up, there is not much the delegates can add today, as representatives of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, are not present.<\/p><p>I also mention Franciscan College in Gormanston and O'Carolan College in Nobber.  There is a range of schools on the list, some of which are in dire need.  My concern is that the budget is not sufficient.  I do not know whether the officials can comment on this, but the list published last Friday - I do not quibble with it - has a price tag, without land costs, of approximately &euro;500 million.  What will be the impact?  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported that, effectively, the promoters of 575 projects were being told that they would not be able to go ahead.  We need to hear a comment on this.  They include all of the schools I have mentioned.<\/p><p>Can the delegates reply on the list published last Friday?  For how many of the projects have sites been acquired, if any?  Certain areas are not included in the list.  I was surprised to see that Ashbourne had not been included for the provision of a new school.  I am sorry to be specific, but this applies to other areas also.  The locations of some of the schools announced are extremely vague.  For example, the one with which I am most familiar is the Drogheda-Laytown catchment area.  It could extend anywhere from Clogherhead to Gormanston to Slane and Duleek.  It is a massive area.  I have suggested to the officials previously that a secondary school could be located in Duleek.  Has the Department looked in detail at that catchment area?  I am glad that it has acknowledged that there is a need for a school in the area, but has it been examined in detail?  Will the delegates outline the position because many parents want to know where the school will be located?  From talking to colleagues throughout the country I am aware that the Galway city-Oranmore regional solution has also been listed.  The reference to Enfield is specific, but there is a lack of specifics in the case of some areas, for example, Kilcoole and Greystones.  The villages of Kilcoole and Newtownmountkennedy are not that far apart, but they are separate.  However, they are listed as together.  If the delegates cannot provide clarity today - I am particularly interested in the Drogheda-Laytown catchment area - when will they be able to provide it in order that parents will be able to make informed decisions?<\/p><p>In terms of places at primary level in September 2019, parents will have been carefully considering the schools to which they should send their children.  We know that a new school will be established, which will probably be welcomed by many of them if they are having problems in finding a place.  In terms of places at second level, presumably children now in fifth class will be able to attend some of the schools to be established in 2019, but they are already looking at other schools in their areas.  There is a particular reason I mentioned Drogheda and Laytown.  Depending on where the school is located, many children will not be interested because it will be in the wrong area as it is such a large catchment area.  I assume the same applies to the Galway city-Oranmore solution.  If the school is placed in one side of the area, it will attract children in that area but not from others.  As parents currently cannot make that decision, we need a timeline as to when decisions will be made, if they have not already been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#L00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I have no doubt that the delegates will not have all of the information to hand on the schools about which we have asked, but it would be appreciated if they corresponded with the clerk to the committee within the next week or so.

I put that question to the Department.  The particular schools represented before the committee today are ones that have experienced long delays.  There are many others on the list the delegates gave us that have not experienced long delays, but for those that have, will the Department consider having some kind of special communication system, whereby there would either be a project manager or a dedicated person to whom they could go when they had questions?  That would be helpful.  Obviously, it would not solve the problem for them, but at least they would have somebody to whom they could go.  I want to put that proposal first to the Department and receive a response from it.<\/p> <p>  On site selection, there was an issue with the site for Mr. Bergin's school, in particular.  It started off as a public private partnership.  I do not know whether that was an issue or whether it makes it different in terms of site selection.  I believe he said in frustration that if his was an Education and Training Board school, he would have a quicker solution.  <\/p> <p>  In its submission the Department outlines the three main ways by which it purchases a site - through local authorities, by direct negotiation and through ETBs.  If a school is not an ETB school and the local authority does not have a site, does it cause particular difficulties?  Will the delegates address again some of the concerns expressed by the school about that issue?<\/p> <p>  The phrase \"site sensitive\" is used frequently when a new site is being purchased.  To give an example in my constituency - Senator Paul Gavan referred to it also - there are two new post-primary schools in Limerick; one of which was opened last September, while the other will open next September.  One has been built on a site owned by the local authority; therefore, there are no difficulties with it and there is clarity and so on.  However, in the case of the other on the eastern side of the city, site acquisition is ongoing.  When one asks a question, one is told that the issue is sensitive but that discussions are taking place with the local authority, etc.<\/p><p>Is there any way that there can be any more clarity on those ones because it is very frustrating?  Does the Department give a bit more information to school management than would be generally publicly available or can it do that?  The most frustrating thing can often be the fact that nobody knows why there is a delay or what the problem is with regard to sites.  Clarity would help a lot in these situations.  The witnesses have said that they cannot answer questions on specific projects today but at some stage I would like more information on the post-primary school in Limerick that will be under the patronage of Educate Together.  That school is going to open in September but I am seeking information about the identification of a site so that a permanent building can be progressed.  <\/p><p> I also seek more clarity on the devolved scheme.  I know that some projects are done by way of a devolved system and that seems to be quicker.  I seek some general information on whether schools can opt for that and if so, whether it would speed things up for them.  It was announced this week that the Department is updating its website with information on the current status of all large scale projects being delivered as part of the schools building programme.  What extra information will be on the website that is not currently on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#L00400","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>My apologies, but I had to step out of the meeting earlier and missed what the witnesses said.  The point I was making earlier to the schools representatives is that there is no plausible excuse for children being taught in substandard schools in this day and age.  Obviously prefabs are a temporary solution in certain schools but the conditions the schools representatives were describing could not possibly comply with normal health and safety standards.  If something tragic was to happen to a child, would everything be solved all of a sudden?  I fear that is the case and that it might have to get to that point before the issue is taken seriously.<\/p> <p>  Are health and safety inspections carried out on temporary accommodation?  Has the Department done an audit of the schools that are in a really dire state?  Can those schools be prioritised?  There is no point in the Department announcing the building of 42 new schools when so many existing schools are on a list, waiting.  Let us deal with this issue first and then deal with new schools.  The current situation is ridiculous.<\/p> <p>  A standard timeframe should apply in the context of new schools so that when a new school is announced, it is delivered within two or three years at most.  Schools should not fall off the list or go into never-never land for 13 years or more.  Common sense is needed here.  The school representatives made some very good points earlier.  They pointed out that we know what the population is going to be in an area and what the need for school places will be.  It is not that the need for a new school arises suddenly and takes the Department by surprise.  The issue must be taken more seriously.

I am essentially going to be repeating some of the comments that my colleagues have made but will be inserting the names of different schools.  I would be very surprised if the officials did not come here with some kind of briefing on Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna given that it has been highlighted on the airwaves in the past week, particularly by parents.  The Department was alive to those interventions by parents because it responded on the airwaves directly to one of the requests that was made.  I will return to that presently.<\/p><p>I wish to reinforce the points made earlier with regard to communications.  I am a public representative, as are my colleagues here, and it is worth revisiting what that means.  I am elected, along with four colleagues in Dublin South West, to represent the people of that area.  One assumes that when one submits a question or series of questions on a project and does so regularly in the D&aacute;il Chamber by way of parliamentary question, or topical issue - which brings it very much to the notice of the Minister and his or her officials - or during the Order of Business, that the Department should then be aware and alive to the fact that the project in question is giving rise to a lot of concern.  As a public representative, I was pretty surprised that the Department confirmed on the airwaves the position with regard to the site acquisition issue with South Dublin County Council but did not provide me with any formal notification on same.  That is pretty appalling communication.<\/p><p>School principals are busy enough as it is without having to deal with bad conditions.  I am not going to go into the details regarding the conditions at Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna because the officials will already be familiar with the case.  School principals are very busy people anyway but many have to spend a great deal of time fruitlessly chasing departmental officials in an effort to find answers.  Today I had to submit a freedom of information request, which really is the last resort for a public representative, to try to find out as much information as possible about the communications between the Department and the local authority because it is the local authority that owns the site.  <\/p><p>My specific questions for the officials relate to the status of the school building programme on which Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna appears and the announcement made by the Minister last week with regard to 40 schools.  Where does the school stand <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the six year school building programme?  There are questions allied to that which Deputy Thomas Byrne has raised regarding the funding implications arising from the addition of 40 projects to the programme.  I would like to know before we leave here this evening the status of the school building programme 2015 to 2021 and the projects included in it to which the Department committed.  Does that programme still stand?  I ask because it has been deleted from the Department's website.  Is that related to the refurbishment and updating of the website?  The programme is not accessible on the Department's website which is a real problem and a serious communication issue. <\/p><p>I understand to some degree the issue around commercial sensitivity but I would also like a definition of same.  The commercial sensitivity argument is thrown out there a lot.  What does that constitute from the Department's perspective, particularly when it is dealing with a local authority?  The argument does not apply in this particular case but it does apply in others.  <\/p><p>Included among the 40 projects announced last week is a post-primary school project in City West.  Has a site been acquired for that?  I do not believe one has been acquired as yet.  In that context, how can the Department announce a project when negotiations regarding site selection and purchase have not even begun?  Site selection and purchase are prerequisites before a sod can be turned.  <\/p><p>Is Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna to proceed?  Is that building project going to proceed and if so, when?  I also seek specific answers regarding communications.  In mid January 2018 an engineer's report was to be submitted to the building and planning section of the Department but that has not happened.  In February the process of selecting a design team was to begin but that has not happened.  On 9 March, according to the building and planning section, the report would be submitted but that has not happened.  On 9 March a schedule of accommodation arrived at the school which was a generic template for a 16 room primary school and not specific to Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna.  Currently there is no date for the engineer's report to be submitted.<\/p><p>The timeline provided by the Department's building and planning section on 29 November 2017 is no longer valid.  In spite of multiple calls and communications from the school and public representatives about the timelines committed to by the Department when it met with the school, timelines which it failed to meet, which is one issue, it failed to explain why it has missed all those timelines and to reply in writing or orally, which leaves a bad taste in the mouths of parents and the principal, and of the board of management.<\/p><p> What is the political input into school project selection?  When the officials present a suite of school projects and it goes up to the Minister's desk, is that the same suite of school projects that leaves the Minister's office for publication thereafter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#M00500","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for coming in.  I expect specific details about the schools present because the cases have been well flagged.  Whatever other schools were raised, the schools that are here that have given up their day are entitled to some clear answers.  I will start on communication.  Do the witnesses accept that the communication for the planning and building unit and in general could be better?  Have they plans to address that?  As a politician, I spend much of my time on the phone, on my emails and asking parliamentary questions, as I am sure every member of this committee does.  I think of the public meetings I have been at in Monasterevin where I, all the Oireachtas Members from Kildare South and seven or eight councillors are hauled in together and asked the same questions.  We all go back and try to find the same answers.  I imagine if the process was streamlined that it would take the frustration out of it for schools and improve communication and it would save the witnesses time too.  Much time must be taken up in the Department answering our queries and questions.  We get those queries and questions because the information is not being provided the school.  We would all, as politicians, be happier if the schools had adequate information and were clearer and happier about that.  It would solve some of those issues.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the role of principals, it is a simple fact that principals are here today fighting for a new school.  Extra-curricular activity is happening in those schools right now.  Earlier today, there was a normal timetable of classes in all of those schools.  There was a full staff room at lunch time and break time.  All of the normal activity is going on and the principal has lost another day fighting for a new school instead of being there to deal with those staff and the care of and ongoing engagement with the pupils.  This has been the case for years with these schools for a litany of different reasons.  The frustration is palpable and the frustration for us as politicians is equally high because it is so unfair to see what some schools have to go through.  Others take it for granted that they get their new school in a really straightforward way, but for those who do not, it is hell on earth for all involved, from the staff, to parents, to pupils, to the principal, to the board of management.  Nobody is free of that.<\/p> <p>  On St. Paul's secondary school in Monasterevin, which is in my constituency, will the witnesses clarify that the St. Paul's project has not in any way been delayed by last week's announcement?  That was on social media over the weekend and it caused much concern and distress.  I do not believe that is the case but I want clarification from officials that the project and the other school projects are on their own trajectory.  I hope the witnesses will give reassurances here that the Department is doing everything to deliver that as soon as is humanly possible.<\/p> <p>  I understand the different ways that sites are acquired.  Is it the case that St. Paul's in Monasterevin was the first time that the Department engaged with Kildare County Council, with the council sourcing the site?  If it was not the first, it was one of the first.  If so, have lessons been learned from the experience?  Something obviously went very wrong here.  We are in 2018 and we are still only at stage 2b.  What lessons have been learned from that?  Can the witnesses give clarity about the status of the site now?  Has it been purchased?  Is there any concern on the part of the Department that there will be any further delays with the site?<\/p> <p>  In the most recent correspondence from the Department to the school, the profiling for the start of construction for St. Paul's in Monasterevin is down as quarter three of 2019.  Days before the Department issued that, the design team for the school had set a trajectory, with all the ducks lined up, with no reason that the school could not start construction in quarter one of 2019.  It might sound like a moot point but it certainly is not to the parents, staff and pupils in Monasterevin.  Six months is an eternity.  Mr. Loftus outlined in his initial presentation that delays can happen.  I accept that delays can happen.  They can happen at planning and at acquisition.  Unfortunately for St. Paul's, it seems to have happened at every stage.  I hope that the Department of Education and Skills is not factoring in extra time to allow for that.  I hope that it is full steam ahead to deliver the school as soon as possible.  If delays happen, we need clear communication as to why they have happened and what the problem is.  Explain why we cannot start construction in quarter one of 2019.  I do not want to see any sense that the Department is building in extra time.  Will the witnesses explain why they think quarter three of 2019 is the earliest possible and is there any way we can claim back some of that time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#N00200","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I have a few questions, including specific questions about St. Paul's secondary school in Monasterevin.  In my role as Chair, I have some questions relating to the overall delivery within the country.  I have about seven of those so I propose to go to them first.  I have a question about the Department's rapid building programme, the time savings between this process and the ordinary process, and how schools are selected for that.  For many, that is an important roadmap for how they can go about delivering a school in a timely fashion.<\/p> <p>  Has the Department reviewed its project management process?  We listened to many shortcomings about that important process.  I assume that, by listening to the earlier session, the witnesses have learned about many areas for improvement.  Have they assessed any of these?  I think I know the answer to this from earlier but I want to put the question because it is important to get an answer.  Is a dedicated project manager assigned for each project, empowered to access all relevant information across all stakeholders, who can keep the principal and the school sufficiently informed and ensure timelines are met?  That is crucial.  I know that Mr. Brian Bergin commented, regarding his stakeholders, about the purpose of parliamentary questions.  That touches on what Deputy Heydon said.  We all submit questions and get the same answers.  If all Oireachtas Members in the constituency were given the same information at the same time as the principal so that we can all work together, it would cut out some of the extra work.  If something lands on Mr. Bergin's desk, then he has to do a full round of consultation and get everybody together.  It could be completely streamlined.<\/p> <p>  Has an analysis been undertaken to determine the efficiency of using prefabs?  We listened to stark figures earlier about their cost.  One of the last parliamentary questions I submitted about St. Paul's secondary school was maybe three weeks ago.  The fact that St. Paul's was told to apply for temporary accommodation, for three prefabs, again for this year seems to be such a waste of money.  When a new school is built, the prefabs are redundant and much money has gone into them.  It has proven difficult for communities to access and use those prefabs.  That is an area to address.<\/p> <p>  On the perceived lack of communication from the Department during individual processes and projects, what systems are in place in the Department to ensure a high level of communication for ongoing projects?  That is a similar point to that of project management.  Will a witness from the Department, whether Mr. Loftus or a colleague, expand further on potential delays in awaiting planning permission?  How can further efficiencies be achieved through ongoing collaboration with local authorities?<\/p> <p>  It must be 15 years since I was a member of Kildare County Council.<\/p><p>At that stage, Monasterevin was in the municipal district.  It was subsequently made part of a different district.  However, 15 years ago, I, along with other councillors and a number of local authority officials, sat down with the order in Moore Abbey to look at the potential sites that were there.  That was 2003 and the school got the go-ahead in 2005.  It seems that an inordinate amount of time has passed but I accept that problems arose in respect of planning permission.  Thankfully, those problems have been dealt with but only since last summer.<\/p><p> On the question of communications, how does the Department ensure consistency and effective knowledge transfer between its various sections regarding ongoing building projects?  There are eight sections within the Department's planning and building unit and there is a relatively large turnover of personnel.  One can deal with somebody who has a lot of corporate knowledge but he or she is then moved, retires or goes to another area. Straight away, one must start building relationships again.  That represents a huge amount of time invested by so many different people.<\/p><p> The final general question I want to ask concerns the general information system, GIS, and about how effective it is, working in tandem with the local authority's projections, to predict where additional accommodation will be needed.  I know Deputy Thomas Byrne inquired about this.  Has there been any instance where accommodation needs have been identified incorrectly?  Does the system enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery?  Do the schools still have to alert the Department to accommodation needs or are the relevant schools identified by the GIS?  Last Friday morning, the list of schools was mentioned.  I know we have had several conversations on this with Mr. Power in particular over the past two years.  I absolutely accept that the published list will not impact in any way on St. Paul's' and the delivery of the project there.  However, I cannot for the life of me understand how, with the exception of St. Paul's, south Kildare, having been on it in 2015, has been left off the list.  Kildare has one of the fastest-growing populations in the country.  It is certainly going to accommodate a lot of the building needed to support families in their quest for homes.  Among the age groups we are talking about, the rate of population growth in the area comprising Kildare town, Newbridge and Kilcullen has been 146% of that relating to the State.  Among children between ages five and 12, the growth rate has been of the order of 206%.  We have identified at least 400 students who will not have secondary school accommodation in seven years' time.  Even at this point, people are scrambling try to get places for their children for September of this year.  I have concerns about the GIS.<\/p><p> To go to back to St. Paul's and leaving aside for a moment the historical reasons why we are in the position in which we find ourselves, we are led to believe that the current situation arose as a result of the signing of the lease and the accompanying legal complexities.  This site was looked at 15 years ago.  It was agreed in 2005 that St. Paul's and Monasterevin would have a new school.  We have overcome all of the difficulties thrown up by the planning process but a lease has still not been signed.  I want a straight answer.  Has the lease been signed?  If not, when do the witnesses expect it to be signed?  Why is there a hold-up?  If we are at the end game regarding the signing of this lease, why could the start date not have been earlier than the fourth quarter of last year?<\/p><p> There is plenty I can say about other schools, particularly the Curragh girls national school and the Curragh boys national school.  I know we will have other conversations about those.  However, I want to put on the record that the primary school buildings in the Curragh are absolutely not fit for purpose.  They would fail every health and safety test.  If any type of commercial property was in this condition, it would be closed down immediately.  There are also small rural schools, such as Ballyshannon national school, which badly need extensions.<\/p><p> My final point concerns autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units.  We are very far behind in this regard.  In Kildare, there are 64 ASD units in primary schools and only 18 in secondary schools.  We have a long way to go in terms of the provision of this service.  The delays are causing a lot of problems for those children who are now at the point of leaving mainstream primary school.  Some of them are having to return to special schools.  We are putting them under pressure too.  I am talking in particular about Scoil na Naomh Uilig in Newbridge and St. Anne's school in the Curragh.  This is a huge problem and it is going to get worse.  We are looking at a juggernaut coming down the tracks.  I thank the witnesses for listening to all of our concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#N00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523975400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I will take the lead on some of the questions and Mr. Power will talk about the GIS, as well as Ashbourne and south Kildare.  A variety of questions were asked.  If it is acceptable, I will pick up on some of the common themes that emerged in the discussion and address any remaining questions afterwards.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of funding and concerns about projects on this building list, one of my priorities since coming into the job as head of the planning and building division has been dealing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of funding and the national development plan, NDP.  I have been in this job six months, having previously worked in the unit more than ten years ago.  I have endeavoured to position the Department so that it can address the twin priorities of dealing with demographics and focusing on refurbishment.<\/p> <p>  We have a budget of &euro;8.4 billion for the schools sector under the NDP.  That compares to the previous ten-year period, for which we had a budget of &euro;4.9 billion.  This is a massive increase in funding which positions us to focus on demographics and increase our focus on refurbishment.  That translates into very immediate current funding of &euro;540 million in 2018.  In 2019, our budget will be in excess of &euro;620 million.  That gives us the financial capacity to move things forward.<\/p> <p>  For decades, there has been underinvestment in public infrastructure in Ireland, not just in schools but across entire areas.  There is an element of catching up in spite of a legacy of historic underinvestment.  However, much good work is happening and a lot of investment is going in now.  The discussion today is about schools but, separate to that, huge investment is going into the higher education sector under the NDP.  That sector will receive &euro;2.2 billion in capital investment over the next ten years, compared with &euro;800 million in the previous ten-year period. <\/p> <p>  To get a sense of the scale of what is happening, members should consider that between &euro;440 million and &euro;450 million worth of large-scale and other projects were under construction at the beginning of this year.  That can be compared with previous years.  In 2010, the equivalent figure was &euro;130 million.  That gives a sense of the funding and investment going into school buildings.  However, as I mentioned already, there is an element of catch-up involved.<\/p> <p>  In regard to transparency, information, communication and related issues, one of the things I was anxious to do was streamline the information on our website.  There were multiple lists on our website and they were not being updated.  I wanted to simplify that and give everyone, including schools and public representatives, a very clear picture in the form of a county-by-county list setting out the current status of all projects being delivered as part of the schools building programme.<\/p><p>That list was updated on our website last week and we will be updating that list of large-scale projects at the end of every month.  That gives a clear picture to schools of the current status of their projects.<\/p><p> In terms of giving timelines to tender and construction generally, the learning experience of the Department - hearing from the schools today, there will be various learning experiences - is that the best period to give certainty to schools of their timeline to tender and construction is when the site issues have been resolved when a project has progressed through planning permission.  If one thinks of it, the two key issues that affect projects are having the site and having planning permission.  Those issues would have impacted on some of the schools that the committee had before it today.<\/p><p> In recent weeks, we would have issued individual letters to more than 50 schools that had their detailed design done - a bit like Whitecross and St. Paul's - giving them clarity and setting out the action plan or pathway for each of those projects progressing through prequalification of contractors and tender through to the construction.  Those letters would have set out a timeline which invariably involves going to construction either over the course of 2018 or into 2019.  That gives the clarity to those individual schools.<\/p><p> I accept we do not do everything perfectly in the Department.  We have a centralised unit in Tullamore and there are 4,000 schools feeding into us.  It is not feasible for us to have the perfect individualised service to each and every school but there is some learning experience that we can take away from today to see how we can improve that and have centralised points of contact for schools as they work their way through.<\/p><p> In terms of the way we are organised in the planning and building division, we have our forward planning which looks ahead to the democratic needs and the enrolment trends and where our new school requirements are.  We have site acquisitions that follow through on those announcements.  We have our architectural planning areas that work through projects going into architectural planning and our rapid team is part of that as well, and ultimately, into construction as well.  We can look at that and see if there is a learning experience for us.<\/p><p> The announcement of the 42 schools triggered quite a lot of public comment, comment from Members - I am sure the committee has heard it as well - and concerns from other schools as to how that might impact on them.  We see this as part of normal business.  These 42 schools will be part of the pipeline of projects to be delivered as part of the school building programme along with the projects that we have listed on our website.  That sets out the current status of those.<\/p><p> A new element which has been learned from other schools is that we want to set out a four-year horizon of our new school requirements.  In our previous announcement of new schools when we were announcing the school building programme in 2015, we announced the new schools that would be needed in 2017 and 2018 as well.  That was giving a two-year lead-in period for the delivery of those projects.  What we have done in the most recent announcement is set out the list of school requirements over a four-year horizon.  That gives us better capacity to put in place the solutions, both accommodation and site, to deliver the accommodation for those schools when it is needed and avoid as much as possible the need for prefab solutions.  That gives us a better lead-in period.<\/p><p> While the Gaelscoil in Knocklyon has a long history regarding prefabs, keeping it at a higher level regarding prefabs generally, it has to be recognised that the Department has put 5,000 extra teachers into the school system over the past two years and that has triggered accommodation requirements.  In some cases that can be dealt with within the individual accommodation of the school, but in other cases it triggers an accommodation need.  In those cases where those schools do their enrolment, and many schools do their enrolment in the February-March period of each year and new teachers start in September, even with the best will in the world that needs an interim accommodation solution while permanent accommodation is being put in place.<\/p><p> We have put a huge concentrated effort into dealing with the prefab issue.  To a large extent, it is also a legacy of the past when there would have been historic underinvestment.  We deal with that in a number of ways.  In 2008, for example, we had approximately 2,000 classrooms in rented prefab accommodation.  At the end of 2017, we had approximately 1,300.  We are at a much lower level.  Our spend on rented prefab accommodation was &euro;14.5 million in 2017.  It would have been a multiple of that figure in 2008.<\/p><p> As for what we have done, we have put in place the additional accommodation scheme which is a devolved scheme.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned devolved projects.  It is a hugely successful scheme in delivering permanent solutions to schools for additional classroom accommodation, and that has helped to reduce the need for prefab requirements.  Since 2010, more than 1,900 projects have been delivered under that scheme catering for, as I stated in my submission, 60,000 school places.  That has been hugely successful and has helped reduce our reliance on prefabs.  As part of further reducing our reliance on them, when we have new applications under that scheme, we look to see how we can replace prefabs as well as part of those applications.  It is making further inroads into the prefab replacement, which is something to which we are committed.  That gives a broad sense of where we are in terms of funding and in terms of approach to projects.<\/p><p> In terms of delivery mechanisms, a valid point was raised about the capacity of, say, school principals to manage the delivery of projects and how that is managed.  Part of the learning experience for us is to see how best that can be achieved because we have various delivery mechanisms.  One of those delivery mechanisms is the rapid build programme.  This involves the design and building of schools with active project management, and it delivers ten new schools every year.  I provided the committee, as part of the written submission, with a list of the 218 new schools that were built over the past eight years which shows the real active delivery of projects.  In terms of the delivery mechanisms that were used in those 218 projects, 97 of them would have been the traditional approach of schools and a design team, 75 of them of them would have been built under the rapid build programme, 22 of them would have been completed under the public private partnership programme, and 24 of them would have been done on a devolved based, either via the education and training board, the Office of Public Works, the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, or the local authority.  We have a wide variety of delivery mechanisms in place to ensure delivery.<\/p><p> Part of the learning experience for us is that the likes of the rapid build programme is particularly suitable for new school projects on greenfield sites.  That will be our main method for getting new schools delivered, whether ones already on the existing programme or schools such as Ballinteer, as we have said to Ballinteer recently.  No doubt it will probably be the method used in the Gaelscoil in Knocklyon as well because it provides a mechanism for getting a project delivered.<\/p><p>Ms O'Neill can speak about the timeline and what is involved in the rapid build programme, assuming a site is there and planning permission has a particularly smooth run.  Our written submission tried to give the committee an idea that there is a lot happening.  We would love for the committee to come down to Tullamore to get a sense of what we are doing.  Much work has been done on planning and delivery - many projects are being delivered - and we want to reassure the committee that the projects on the school building programme are being delivered, will be delivered and are capable of being delivered as part of the national development plan.  Our focus on the 42 new schools relates to our being given a better lead-in period to enable the accommodation solutions in a more structured manner. <\/p><p> I will ask Ms O'Neill to discuss the rapid build programme and Mr. Power about the geographic information system, GIS, and then I can come back on specific questions, including the three schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>We want answers.

It is a project for the delivery of new schools when new schools are required in a short timeframe.  This arises, for instance, where a new school has been established in temporary accommodation and there is a delay in the identification and procurement of a permanent site for the permanent home for that school, and the school is rapidly outgrowing its temporary accommodation.  Once the new site is identified and the procurement process has commenced, the project progresses as part of the rapid programme to ensure that the permanent accommodation is available in the shortest possible time, thus allowing the school to move from its temporary home and avoid the need for additional temporary accommodation.  The ideal scenario is when the site is identified and the procurement process commenced where the need for a new school is identified, thus allowing the accommodation to be in place when the new school is established and the school can move immediately into its new home.  Because of the new school announcement, we are looking at methods by which we can address some of the schools on that list in that time frame.<\/p> <p>  The timeframe for a rapid project, where there is a smooth site acquisition process and a smooth planning process can take anything from two to three years, but is dependent on that.  Planning permissions are difficult for schools, as we are all aware.  That can add up to a year to the planning process, if it has to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, if there are requests for information and so on.  Under the rapid programme, there is a project manager with an internal technical team and there is an internal administrative team.  They work closely together and with the local authorities to try to ensure a smooth planning process so that no problems arise in the delivery of the school.  It does not always work because external influences always come into play.  One major issue that arises is that of traffic around schools.  <\/p> <p>  Nevertheless, a project can progress through the system by the traditional method if it is not impeded by issues related to sites and planning in about four to six years.  We have a system in place called the adapt system, which has 20 projects which are being project managed to proceed through the traditional system.  The intention is to roll out more adapt systems in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen O'Neill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523975400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>To summarise what Ms O'Neill has said, the design and build programme is very much about project management which is one of the key themes which emerged from the discussion here.  That has delivered solutions quickly for the Department.  Obviously, it requires the site to be in place and ideally that there is a smooth delivery through the planning permission process.  The adapt programme is a separate programme which uses project managers on traditional projects.  We have had successful projects working through our planning process to tender in that and we will continue to use.  For projects which are still on the Department's building programme that have to work their way into planning, we will see if there are means by which the rapid build programme or the adapt programme can be used to move those projects forward as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  Before Mr. Power speaks about the GIS, I will deal with some of the issues raised on particular schools today.  I am conscious that I am coming here having been assistant secretary for six months and I might not necessarily know all background detail.  Looking at Whitecross in Julianstown as a project to see what can be learned from it, the design team was appointed in March 2011.  It is a 16 classroom school project, which was envisaged as a phased construction.  That meant that the school would continue to operate and there would be a small decant from the existing building as the project was being worked through rather than a full decant off site.  That is how the project started and how it got planning permission, which was granted in the first quarter of 2014.<\/p> <p>  Separately, options were presented for a full decant of the school from the site.  Various options were examined and ultimately the school bought some land adjoining the school site which enabled a decant.  The temporary accommodation needed for that required planning permission and that permission was not received until summer 2016.  The change in the overall project, the time involved in getting the site and securing the planning permission had an impact on the project.  It has now completed design.<\/p> <p>  On 16 March we received a revised version of that design with the cost plan.  Costs were mentioned earlier but I do not want to get into that because of the commercial sensitivities in a project that has not yet been tendered.  We expect that we will respond to the school on the design within the next couple of weeks and that the project, which has been given a letter by the Department on its progression, will be through the tendering process during 2018 with the intention of being on site in the first quarter of 2019.  If the design team thinks it can do better than this and be on site in the fourth quarter of 2018, so much the better.<\/p> <p>  I am not saying the Department is blameless in this.  I do not doubt there were issues that could have been turned around more quickly by the Department but I am looking at the project in hindsight to see what can be learned and how we can move forward.  This is a traditionally managed project.  There is a question of would the use of a project manager, such as we have in the adapt programme, have been beneficial in driving a project such as this one forward.<\/p> <p>  St. Paul's secondary school in Monasterevin has been mired for two reasons.  One relates to the identification and acquisition of a site and the other was the particular planning issues.<\/p><p>As an example of a project, therefore, we probably could not have identified a better one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#R00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523975400,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Yes, but I would not necessarily regard that as indicative.

The Chief State Solicitor's office is working with the legal representatives of the landowners with a view to concluding the conveyancing.  I am not in a position to get into the detail on that given that there is a legal process in train but it took until 2013 to get that site issue fully resolved.  The final legalities are being worked through but notwithstanding that, we appointed a design team in April 2014 to get this project delivered.  It has gone through the planning permission process, which was not a simple one.  It probably took the best part of a year longer than we would have wished.  Planning permission has been received.  The designs have been done up and it is one of the approximately 50 projects on which we have given individualised letters to provide clarity and the pathway forward to tender and construction.  The latest design was received in the Department on 10 April and we envisage a response from the Department before the end of April in terms of any comments it might make on that.  After this long journey, and we acknowledge it has been a difficult journey, it now has a very clear pathway forward in terms of tender and construction.<\/p> <p>  On the comments made about quarter 3 in 2019, if the design team is able to provide an improved timeline on that, that is certainly something the Department will examine.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Ballinteer, even though I used to live in Ballinteer many years ago, I will ask Mr. Power to give the update on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523975400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>On the Ballinteer project, as has been outlined previously, the school opened in September 2012 in the grounds of St. Tiernan's community school on what is a 13-acre site in that area owned by the Department.  It is a very valuable site in an area where it is difficult to get any other sites and our objective was to maximise both the site and for the school itself.  Outline planning permission was applied for to the local authority in 2012.  It was refused.  We went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which upheld the refusal.  We went back to the county council with a new outline planning permission application and again the issue was about access onto that site from the roads around Ballinteer.  It was deemed by the county council not to be safe and to impede traffic so again it was fully refused.  We went back to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the second time and it pointed out to us that what it would welcome in this particular case would be co-operation between the local authority and the Department in any future planning application to maximise the possibility of the success of the application and to ensure a co-ordinated approach overall on access to this education broad campus.<\/p> <p>  At that point a site selection report was undertaken by our engineers who came up with 18 possible routes into the site.  In fairness, four of those routes were on foot but 14 were possible for some vehicular access onto the site.  Again, we went back to the county council with that and it picked out one preferred site.  The county council had particular concerns about the site.  There are protected structures on the site.  There is a Victorian walled garden and other structures also.  Unfortunately, the preferred council access for the site was alongside the walled garden and we had to have regard to that, but it also fell into the ownership of two third party outside owners.<\/p> <p>  We went back to the council with new plans for it to examine and it asked us at that point, and this is now 2015-16, to return with a full report from a conservation architect to examine the impact of the route on the protected structures on the site.  At that point, we engaged a consultant architect.  We drew up the report and went back to the council with new plans.  We also engaged with the third parties and it emerged at that point that one of them had proposals on which, unfortunately, we could not reach agreement.  It is a property owner, a new developer, and he had particular reasons for looking at the site in a particular way, which would impact on the school.  From our point of view, the school was the priority but we had no access into the site.  On foot of the fact that we could not find agreement with that third party and we found full agreement with the other third party, the project has been given to the rapids team.  They are working with their consultants on examining the means of access and egress on the site with a view, as I understand it, to going back to the council with a full planning permission application.  Arrangements have been made with the council for it to go into pre-planning on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Power.

There is a system called ArcGIS, which is an off-the-shelf system in the first instance but has been built to accommodate the needs of the school planning system.  It takes all the data we have to use and puts that into a spatial context in terms of a map of Ireland overall, which is broken up into 314 individual school planning areas.  One of the reasons behind this is that we know what the national peaks are in terms of school enrolments.  We know that primary enrolment overall comes to a peak in the current year and, nationally, should begin to fall back at that point whereas post-primary enrolments will continue to grow until about 2025.  Unfortunately, that growth is not even across the country so it means we have to look at specific areas.  That is the reason we break up the entire country into 314 school planning areas.  They are largely post-primary feeder areas.  Primary schools largely feed into post-primary centres and they could be single or multiple centres.  We look at those as a cluster and that is what forms the very basis of each school planning area overall.  The GIS allows us to take all the data from the enrolments from the primary and post-primary pupil databases, Ordnance Survey, the census and child benefit data for the nought to four age group because they are not currently in our school system.<\/p><p>These data are then attributed across the 314 areas, which allows us to determine potential growth in each area.  We then project forward using enrolment figures.<\/p><p> The position is fairly stable because once we have figures on enrolments, the number of children aged four years and under and the number of children in school at each class, it is possible to make a reasonably accurate projection for each year.  We then calibrate for intake patterns, by which I mean that while each school planning area will theoretically have a 100% intake from its area at primary and post-primary level, we know that, for a range of reasons, children attend either the nearest school, the school that suits parents or a school outside the school planning area.  Some people live on the borders of school planning areas and will, therefore, fall into other areas.  We identify whether there is a significant additional intake above 100% in each area or whether the intake falls below 100%.  Our projections are made on the basis of an average of three years of the intake pattern because intake patterns are normally fairly stable.  Again, we have to calibrate the system to take account of this.<\/p><p> The most recent national exercises did not include housing data.  In 2013, new housing provision was at a low of 8,300 units.  It is now increasing again and reached 19,200 units in 2017.  There is a substantial impact in areas where new housing is being built through the local authorities or another system.  This can have a significant impact on school planning in a particular school planning area.<\/p><p> We collect all the data from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, which drives much of the major housing development.  New developments under the LIHAF process pass straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We have also interact on an ongoing basis with local authorities on their local action plans, LAPs.  As these project forward, the LAPs are not sufficiently strong to allow us to predict enrolments for schools.  Some months ago, we sought from all local authorities updated information to clarify how many houses had been provided in the previous 18 months or were due to be delivered for the coming 18 months.  We had to revert to some local authorities on the matter.  We indicated that new developments of 100 units or more would be significant because 100 houses generate in the region of 1.2 primary classrooms based on house occupancy, average number of children per household and so forth.  We make calculations on that basis.  Given that 100 houses produces approximately one primary classroom, it was a reasonable number to choose.  Unfortunately, we only received returns indicating developments of 100 or more units from some areas and we had to revert to the local authorities on the matter.  If one has a school planning area in which there are several housing developments of 50 or 60 units each, this could be significant.  Some local authorities returned figures on such developments.  Others did not do so and we clarified the matter for them.<\/p><p> One of the issues we must be aware of in terms of new housing is internal migration.  Obviously, people move from A to B within the country.  New housing in some areas will have a take-up from within the area on the part of people who are renting.  This means they will not necessarily generate new school places, whereas in other areas, particularly those in which major developments take place, there tends to be a large influx from a broad area outside the area and we must take account of this.  While this process is not exact, this time, based on all the new developments, we have brought the system up to date by introducing these extra data which we did not use previously.  From the point of view of how we finally access this, we also consider existing and planned school capacity.  This is a major part of the work we are required to do in this area.<\/p><p> Some schools will have capacity and classrooms available and some schools will have planned capacity under our six-year programme.  The three schools in question probably have planned capacity in addition to current capacity.  We plan for this to meet future needs.  We cannot replicate but it will be delivered because it is in the pipeline, notwithstanding delays.  We factor in this extra new capacity which will also be delivered.<\/p><p> As a result of all of this, we arrive at a new figure for net demand for each of the 314 school planning areas.  With primary school enrolments set to decline from 2018 onwards, we found that there will be either a fully stable or declining population in up to 75% of primary school planning areas, whereas the shoe is very much on the other foot in respect of post-primary schools.  In some areas, up to 70% of school planning areas at post-primary level have some degree of increase.  While this increase will be minor in some cases, in others it will be significant.<\/p><p> We use existing capacity, extended capacity, major projects or new schools to address these needs depending on the size and scale involved and the extent and duration of the demand.  In some cases, demand will peak briefly before rapidly declining.   We then address the issues of overall size in terms of the number and scale of schools, whether greater diversity is required in some areas and language in terms of English or Irish-medium schools.  All of these factors enter the equation.<\/p><p> In terms of size, we have to address the issues of the need for sufficient scale and the best educational environment for the children in question, including with regard to choice of subjects and specialist facilities, particularly at post-primary level.  Normally, we would not create small post-primary schools because they must be of a scale that gives students a broad choice of subjects and enables the provision of sufficient specialist facilities.  At primary level, we normally provide schools that approximate in size to one standard each.  As the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level is 26:1, the standard will be a class of 26 pupils, moving up from junior infants up to sixth class over eight years.  Depending on size, we will provide an eight, 16 or 24-classroom school.  In some cases, we will even provide schools with 32 classrooms.  These schools are standard size but there are schools around the country that are non-standard size because they fit the population of the relevant area.<\/p><p> In post-primary schools, the normal standard size to give the best spread of opportunity for those attending a school that can accommodate 1,000 pupils.  However, schools with between 500 and 800 pupils are not uncommon.  The size will depend on demand.  Post-primary schools are generally not provided where the scale is under 500, although there are some exceptions.  When the peak is below this level, we try to extend the capacity of existing schools or provide what we describe as a regional solution, of which there are a number in the announcement of 42 schools.<\/p><p>That is where two contiguous school planning areas both have a need that is below that threshold but by putting the two together we can come up with a regional solution.  Outside urban areas regional solutions are only practical for post-primary schools in most cases because they mean longer travelling distances, whereas in urban areas sometimes we can have one of those solutions for primary schools where areas are quite close to each other.  Again, it all depends on where we perceive the growth to be.  We use child benefit data for children up to four years of age to see exactly where the growth is in the school planning area.  I take the point made by the Deputy earlier about some of the school planning areas being very big in size.  That is true.  It generally reflects the spread of the population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#R00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I accept that.

This is new because previously we generally announced two years in advance.  The four year horizon facilitates greater and earlier planning for new sites and permanent buildings so we will have less temporary accommodation and fewer of the issues we have discussed here today.  However, there is an absolute need for ongoing review here.  This is because, first, we have a four year horizon overall which in school planning terms is quite long because things change, populations change and populations move and, second, we have now brought in housing data and we know that major new housing developments are being approved almost weekly.  Some of the questions raised on some of the areas may mean that we have to revisit those and see how best to provide.  We would have to revisit areas in between the major exercises because this situation, which did not happen over the past eight to ten year period, is happening very quickly as well.  We have a commitment to continue looking at that.<\/p> <p>  The next step on this will be the patronage process.  When we move into that process for the 2019 schools, that is, the schools to be established and to open in 2019, we will have to run the patronage process for the post-primary schools first and then for the primary schools.  We expect to be doing that over the coming months.  On that front, and to conclude on the process, there is a new online process for patronage and for parental preferences to be expressed.  We were not entirely happy, and the new schools establishment group also expressed its unhappiness, with the shortcomings of the old system, which was in the hands of patrons only and, unfortunately, patrons had a very hard job as well trying to collect individual patron preferences from parents on the street.  From our point of view we wish to put the system online and to give parents more information.  We want to provide them with comparative information on the patron groups because the differences are not well understood at present.  It will enable parents to make a more informed choice and it should be easier for parents to go online.  Hopefully, we will make the system more efficient from the Department's point of view also because we will be able to make the system produce outcomes from it which can feed into our overall deliberations.<\/p> <p>  Before I leave the subject of the GIS and new schools, perhaps I should address Ashbourne and south Kildare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#T00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#T00800","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523975400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>There were specific questions on that.

Senator Ruane mentioned instances where the Department says we have been in regular contact with schools yet this is not the experience of some of the individual schools.  From the Department's perspective, we are a single, central unit dealing with 4,000 schools.  There are some constraints on our capacity to respond to each and every query from every school.  We were anxious to update our website and streamline the information on it as a means of giving a clearer and more transparent picture for schools in terms of the current status of all their projects.  That is set out and listed now on our website in a single, clear list which will be updated at the end of every month.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also raised issues about how we can improve communication.  That is one of the learning experiences we will take away from today to see, in addition to what we have done in terms of the website, if there is anything else we can do to help improve communications.  That is something we will look at.  She also raised issues about site acquisitions and compulsory purchase of sites.  Compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, are done by local authorities.  It has been done in a couple of cases in respect of schools and the local authorities have done it for us.  It is not a simple or quick process.  It takes time.  Our experience is that it would be an option of last resort in terms of getting a site where there might be an unwilling vendor.  Our experience is that if there is a willing vendor, we can work solutions around site issues in a speedier way rather than having to go down the CPO route.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne raised various questions.  Some of them were about individual schools in Meath.  If the Deputy agrees, we might come back to him individually on those questions.

There are 4,000 schools that can knock on our door.  We are talking here about large-scale projects, but there can be devolved projects and other issues as well.  We have to consider what is workable and manageable.  We view the website as an important avenue for keeping schools updated on the current status of their projects.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the site for the Monasterevin school was mentioned.  The Deputy asked about the procurement of a site, why it took so long and how that issue could have been managed better.  In general we procure about one third of our sites from other State bodies, mostly the local authorities.  Wherever we need sites for schools, we generally look at that avenue as a first port of call.  There are standard methods for proceeding in that way.  We engage closely with local authorities, such as the Fingal area, which help us to acquire sites.  We have learned that it is important to identify, acquire and procure the site.  That is the key first step in terms of the delivery of new school projects and is something we are working on.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the level of information we can give about the site acquisition process.  There are particular sensitivities when dealing with developers.  Negotiations are going on and we have to be careful that we do not compromise the negotiation process by putting too much information into the public domain.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the devolved delivery of projects.  Within the 218 new schools delivered, a cohort of schools were delivered on a devolved basis, as I set out earlier.  In addition, the permanent accommodation scheme, which has delivered in excess of 1,900 projects and 60,000 school places over the past eight years is one of the key methods we have used to deliver projects on a devolved basis.  The devolved basis method enabled the schools to go ahead and deliver the projects.  Clear parameters and arrangements for achieving that were set out.  Where the projects to be delivered on a devolved basis are significant projects worth &euro;1 million or more, we deliver them through the support of other agencies, such as an education and training board.  In terms of a wider learning experience, I believe education and training boards are a useful mechanism to help support schools generally, both ETB schools and non-ETB schools, in terms of managing the delivery of projects.  The Education and Training Boards Act has enabling legislation to facilitate that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Funchion mentioned health and safety issues in temporary accommodation and audits that have been carried out.  From the Department's perspective, health and safety legislation makes it clear that that is an issue that is managed at local school level.  The Department worked with the Health and Safety Authority and the education centres in developing procedures and manuals on managing health and safety in schools, and those are available to assist schools.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lahart mentioned the Gaelscoil in Knocklyon, and the difficulty with communication, including tweeting.  There were also issues about having to resort to freedom of information, FOI, requests, parliamentary questions and Topical Issue debates to get information.  I am not sure that I can answer every aspect of his question.  I am looking at it now in terms of where we stand and the pathway forward.  Part of the learning experience for us is how we can improve communication for schools generally, including the Gaelscoil in Knocklyon.  In terms of that project, locating a site has been a particular issue.  The school was in prefabs for 22 years, which reflects the fact that there has been a legacy of underinvestment in public infrastructure generally for decades.  However, the site issue is moving forward, which will provide a pathway for delivering that project which is part of our school building programme.  As a new school project, one of the first areas we would look at in terms of delivering the project would be as part of our rapid design and build programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#V02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus"},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Can I ask a supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#W00100","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1523975400,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018041700002#W00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523975400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Deputy Lahart also asked about political input to school building projects.

The Age Friendly Ireland programme, as members will probably be aware, over the past eight to nine years has provided a network of age-friendly county and city programmes in order to consider the ageing demographic and respond to the needs to older people.  The first programme started in County Louth and, to date, there are 31 age-friendly programmes located across the country.  The Age Friendly Ireland programme is hosted by Meath County Council as part of shared services on an interim basis and it is co-ordinating that response.  The committee will have been given a copy of my presentation in advance.  The members can see on the screens in front of them a snapshot of some of the initiatives that have been responsive to the current needs of older people.<\/p> <p>  Over the past nine years we have consulted about 20,000 older people.  We have also carried out a national baseline and I will outline a few statistics in a minute or two.  I wish to briefly state that there are two kinds of needs when it comes to housing for older people.  First, the current needs of the ageing demographic.  They face challenges like retrospective builds in terms of housing and customising or adapting houses to their needs.  Second, there are future generations.  If we are serious about providing housing for older people then we must consider sustainability and lifetime adaptability so that now, with the forthcoming tranche of housing, we can put universality into them.  That would mean houses would no longer need to be retrospectively downsized to meet the needs of an ageing population.  The members will be pleased to hear from me and all of my colleagues in other organisations that there are loads of opportunities and examples of how that can happen across the country. <\/p> <p>  We have an ageing population.  Older people want to remain in their own homes and access to services.  They do not want to transition into residential care unnecessarily.  They want to transition and for houses to be adapted to their needs as they age.  Such a viewpoint is substantiated by our national baseline.  We conducted such research with the Department of Health and it was called the healthy and positive aging baseline.  It was carried across 21 local authority areas.  The initiative was conducted in partnership with the Health Service Executive, HSE, Age Friendly Ireland, the Department of Health and Atlantic Philanthropies.  The fieldwork was carried out, and we developed 76 indicators, which are aligned to the national positive ageing strategy and the World Health Organization's Global Network for Age-Friendly Cities and Communities.  <\/p> <p>  I have given a snapshot but I can supply the committee with a full version of the composite report, which is national baseline data.  In terms of current issues, some people are empty nesters and want to downsize.<\/p><p>There are problems with housing maintenance and housing conditions.  There are many services within the community, such as care and repair schemes and befriending programmes, that can respond to those issues but, critically, there are still many people who do not know what is available to them.  Even fuel poverty and the like are continuing issues.<\/p><p> The next slide concerns housing attitudes and it substantiates what I have said.  What do older people in Ireland want?  After consulting with this number of people and the national baseline, older people want to remain living in their own homes and as part of their communities, but not necessarily in their current housing conditions.  That could be because they can no longer get up the stairs or there might be obstacles to that.  The top thing they do not want to do is transition into residential care or even to move in with family.  They want to retain their independence for as long as possible.  They would like financial help with their bills.  Some older people were not able to keep their house warm in the past 12 months and some of them had to go without heating.  They would be people who are living in three or four bedroom houses.  They need to live in appropriate accommodation that is warm.  We have some great examples and, as I explained to the clerk to the committee, we have examples that are currently being devised in a policy document.  There is Colivet Court in Limerick, the Great Northern Haven, which members will hear about today, and N&aacute;s na R&iacute;ogh Housing Association.  There are many different housing case studies which members can examine after the meeting.<\/p><p> The next slide is the four components of housing.  When one thinks of housing, one thinks of bricks and mortar but it is so much more than that.  Obviously, there are the physical things and the opportunity for the committee is to look at lifetime adaptability, housing options and retrospectively to look at things such as the housing adaptation grants.  However, there is also access to clinical care and to social services, whether it is a visit to the library, a home help or local transportation.  The emerging aspect is technological.  We need to look at technology in the home to be able to make our homes more sustainable.<\/p><p> I will finish up in terms of the policy context.  From our perspective, the Age Friendly Ireland programme is hosted by local government and works with all the key Departments.  There are two actions in the Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  One is that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Health would work on a joint draft policy.  We were invited to participate in that and we were able to provide our housing research which looks at all the core components of good housing - location, place making, use of brown field sites and housing allocations.  We are looking at the broader context of not just social housing, but housing for everybody, including owner-occupier.  That policy is being developed and I understand it will be published and launched shortly.<\/p><p> We provide housing and public realm training and have rolled it out to architects, engineers and planners across the 31 local authorities.  We will continue to roll that out to approved housing bodies and private developers.  It is a priority for the future that people are made aware of what the challenges are and, perhaps, to debunk the myth that it is hugely more costly.  It will cost more to build one's house in an age friendly way if one wants it to be sustainable, but it does not have to be so much that it would deter people.  It is certainly more costly not to do it.  That is the argument.  We have also provided recommendations for county development plans across the 31 local authorities and we have worked with the national planning framework to ensure the principles and awareness of the ageing demographic are translated into that framework.<\/p><p> That is an overview of some of the resources we have developed over the past few years.  I sent them to the clerk of the committee to be circulated to the members.  The age friendly principle is based on the fact that if one designs for the young, one excludes the old, and if one designs for the old, one includes everybody.  Sustainable and inclusive communities and housing options are key to building a sustainable, age friendly country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine McGuigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to today's meeting.

Housing linked to community support is absolutely vital to reduce the pressure on residential nursing home care and acute hospital care and to allow older people to remain at home, where they want to be.<\/p><p>Housing for older people is already a significant problem, however.  More than one in eight older people has housing problems, and of the last 1,400 cases of older people who have come to us for support between 70 and 90 years of age, housing is the second biggest issue.  At the back of our short submission we have outlined what we believe is a spectrum of housing, the different types of housing that are available.  There is no one size that fits all.  All options have a role to play but to varying degrees.  Up and down the country there are some marvellous examples of housing that have been developed, usually by local champions, by people putting in great efforts and bringing people together.  We need to develop models that are transferable, scalable, can work in both urban and rural settings and are designed to age-friendly principles.  <\/p><p> From our work we have come up with recommendations as a result of the stories and challenges of the people who come to us.  Our proposals include: to review and update Rebuilding Ireland to reflect the needs of an ageing Ireland; to provide funding towards developing new age-friendly models of housing; to provide more public housing for older people requiring varying levels of support; to provide grant funding for housing adaptation to meet demand in a consistent and user-friendly manner; to implement long-term renting options; and to update the pension scheme in the light of reduced ownership because our whole pension scheme is based on house ownership, which is decreasing.  On house ownership, people may not realise that more than half of older people have housing condition problems.  The housing adaptation grant, HAG, is run differently in every county, is complex and is not funded to meet demand.  We feel a key thing that could be done, relatively quickly, is to address these issues to support people to remain in their own homes.<\/p><p> House ownership is dropping at approximately 1% each year.  This means several thousand older people are now retiring into private rented accommodation.  Private rented accommodation is not suited to many older people because, ultimately and legitimately, one is only 224 days away from becoming homeless.  When older people lose their homes, they lose their community, their friends, their support and everything around them.  They cannot compete on fixed income in a rising rent market.  Our proposal to address that is to have long-term leases to provide greater security.  More public housing for older people should be provided so that people who are on the housing list or have been renting all of their lives could possibly buy in to that.  There are other elements along the continuum of shared houses, retirement villages, and downsizings.  While these have a role to play, we believe only a small percentage of people will go into these.  They could require a large amount of effort and a large amount of money.  Without alternative housing options, if one does decide to downsize, where is one going to go?  Where is one going to go in one's own community?  We need to move away from downsizing a little bit, as an immediate solution.  Maybe it is a long-term solution on the basis of having housing choices for older people and they will choose to downsize.<\/p><p> On approved housing bodies, under Rebuilding Ireland, there is only one location for housing with on-site support.  The demand for this type of housing is in the thousands.  Currently, there is one location.  On the basis that, by 2022, we are going to be 600 nursing home beds short, we will therefore need to create alternatives, as other countries have.  That  leads us to the proposal that we need to review Rebuilding Ireland, to reflect an ageing Ireland that takes account of the support that older people require on and off site.  <\/p><p> As we look at that spectrum, our work in Alone is to try to work out the demand, by community health care organisation CHO area, and by council area for all these different types of houses.  We hope by the middle of June to be in a position to produce those demand figures so we can then start discussing how we meet the demand for all of those different areas.  As soon as we have that work finished we will share it with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Moynihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523962800,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I now want to call on Ms Joyce for her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#G00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Thank you.  We are very grateful to have the opportunity to meet with the committee this afternoon.<\/p> <p>   Both the programme for partnership Government and national positive ageing strategy contain commitments to enable people to live in their own homes for longer, when deemed appropriate.<\/p><p>Despite these commitments we have developed a system that seems to treat home supports more as a way to empty acute hospital beds than to enable an older person to age at home with dignity and independence, and for the accommodation to be person-centred and meet the person's changing needs.<\/p><p> To meet these commitments it is essential that the housing aid for older people scheme, as well as the other programmes under the housing adaption grant, continues to be adequately resourced.<\/p><p> As indicated in table 1 in our submission, from 2010 to 2016 great variance can be seen in the overall funding to the scheme, the number of payments made and the average grant amount.  Between 2010 and 2013, funding for the scheme fell sharply, as did the number of grants.  At the start of 2014, a number of changes were introduced to the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  These included a reduction in the size of the maximum grant available, changes in the income bands and an increase in the age for eligibility from 60 to 66 years.  The Government argued these changes were necessary to target the funding towards those most in need.<\/p><p> It important for members to recall that the terms of reference for the 2013 review that led to these changes explicitly included the then recessionary economic climate and shrinking budget as the context.  Those circumstances no longer exist and consequently, the scheme needs to be re-examined in the light of the current economic climate.  The impact of these changes has meant that the poorest of older people now receive a reduced maximum grant while being expected to pay for a greater percentage of the work.  A household, for example, with a yearly income of less than &euro;30,000 may be eligible for a maximum grant of &euro;8,000 or 95% of the cost of the works to be carried out, whichever is greater.  At the maximum grant and percentage rate, this low-income household will need to find funding to match &euro;421.  This represents a substantial burden for someone reliant on a State pension.  While the level of funding increased by 20% in 2014, the number of grants awarded increased by more than 100%.  This indicates that the funding is being spread more thinly.  By 2016, year on year there was an increase in overall funding.<\/p><p> Age Action feels strongly that the scheme is not adequately resources.  We ask that the changes introduced to the scheme in January 2014 be reversed to ensure better access to grants for disadvantaged older people.  While the additional &euro;5 million announced by the Government in budget 2018 for overall housing adaptation grants is welcome, there is no clarity yet as to how this will be spent across the three funding programmes.  In our budget 2018 proposals we sought an increase of &euro;18 million to restore funding for housing aid for older people.  In the context of reversing the 2014 changes, which would create greater demand for the grant, we believe this is still a fair and sensible proposal.<\/p><p> Calls to Age Action&rsquo;s helpline frequently highlight inconsistences in the implementation of these grants.  Many of the callers to the helpline find the complexity of the application process difficult to navigate.  They experience delays in assessment and approval.  This can be very stressful and upsetting as, in our experience, most applications are made in emergency or crisis situations.  Different local authorities interpret the rules of the various schemes in different ways.  Age Action calls for greater clarity and consistency in the administration of the schemes and we would welcome a review of the schemes.<\/p><p> The current policy of prioritising the provision of housing adaption grants to facilitate discharge from hospitals on an emergency basis means that older people in hospital can access them more easily than those living in the community.  This makes it harder for older people in the community - such as those with non-emergency needs - to have their care needs met.  Enabling older people to remain at home for longer through investment in these schemes can deliver savings by ensuring that fewer older people require preventable hospitalisation or residential care.  We need to facilitate community living, mitigate preventable hospitalisation and, if deemed suitable, provide an alternative to nursing homes admittances for those already in hospital and awaiting discharge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Corona Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for extending to me the opportunity to appear before the committee.<\/p> <p>  Last year, as part of its sustainable development goals, SDGs, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, UN-DESA, brought forward the older persons 2030 agenda for sustainable development.  While the achievement of many of the SDGs are supported and reinforced by housing policies and actions, we see goal 11, to \"Make cities, communities, and human settlements [age] inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\" and goal 3, to \"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\" as the relevant overarching global, European and national policy objectives before us.<\/p><p>Regardless of the varying pressures and dynamics of ageing we see between urban and rural Ireland, there is an imperative to align our efforts towards more smart, sustainable and inclusive development for all ages.  There are three transpositions, or prospective shifts to viewing the topic that I would like to make, that may open up a solution space in the landscape before us.<\/p><p> The first transposition is to reframe the challenge, to move from meeting the needs of housing for older persons to meeting the housing needs of persons as they age.  Housing for older people is not a segmented cohort problem.  Ageing, and associated age-related decline in functioning is a universal reality facing us all.  We need universal, mainstream and inclusive responses that, over time, will make much of our housing stock adaptive and fit for purpose, for all of us, in an ageing society.<\/p><p> The second transposition is to reframe the challenge and to move from meeting the housing needs of persons as they age to meeting the home needs for persons as they age.  The term \"home\" or \"housing\" risks limiting our considerations to bricks and mortar, and to a transactional view of place as primarily property and financial assets.  While these are very important, they do risk diminishing the value, meaning and sense of home, of place and of belonging that is so vital to our physical and spiritual well-being.  Along with protection and shelter, home encompasses the locus of our social connectedness, attachment, neighbourhood, family, our sense of security and identity.  Location - the sense of adjacency, density, amenity and quality, both physical and environmental - and desire - our attachment to place, community and intergenerational solidarity - are all interwoven elements in this rich milieu of home and place.  These motivations do not fade as we age.  They intensify.<\/p><p> The third transposition I would like to make to reframe the challenge is to move from meeting the home needs of persons as they age to empowering persons to meet their home needs as we age.  At the heart of this issue are the questions: whose problem is it, what mechanisms and choices are available to us to address it, and what is the price of failure, or better, the value of success?  These are interconnected, but we do know that the price of failure is a latter life of poor quality; reduced participation, isolation, and reduced health and well-being, and poor overall system and service effectiveness; and, an over-reliance on long-term residential nursing care, avoidable hospital admissions and readmissions, and slower discharges.  Empowerment is a complex mix of rights, responsibilities, capabilities and choices, energised by both awareness and desire.  While there is innovation in the public sector, today there is very little evidence that mainstream housing market mechanisms have brought forward many appropriate options to allow currently unaware persons to exercise either their choices or their responsibilities to plan and act for more successful ageing.<\/p><p> Today, there is no market functioning at scale that makes available universal homes in sustainable neighbourhoods.  Empowering persons to meet their home needs as they age is a societal responsibility, and I suggest that the housing market needs to be stimulated, or incentivised, to engage in greater innovation to address and seed initial supply.  With the right mix of partners, risks could be spread across multiple stakeholders across the value chain, and for a defined period of time, in a range of public-private pilot engagements, to offer choice, test demand and evaluate socioeconomic impact.  Such housing and health policy experimentation needs to be holistic, to address planning, design, support service, digital and financial innovation.<\/p><p> With an age-dependency ratio approaching 1:2 by 2060, this is more than a specialised housing problem for a cohort.  It requires a paradigm shift in how we collectively envisage and approach the challenge of our housing stock for current and future generations.  It will require aware citizens with the opportunities and freedoms to respond, plan and choose their solutions for their futures.  I think right now it requires public policy experimentation to create the conditions to foster innovation so that citizens can exercise choices to age in place soon, and into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rodd Bond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523962800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I call Deputy O'Dowd.

I know Mr. Bond from the great work he is doing in Dundalk and the Great Northern Haven, which is an example of excellent technology use in a community that lives as independently as they do down there.  It is very worthwhile and I believe it is a model for all future housing for older people.  I would also like to say that I have been concerned about all of these issues for many years.  My particular concern is that the problem with the housing adaptation grant as I understand it, is that it depends on what the local authority budget actually is.<\/p><p>The problem with the housing adaptation grant, as I understand it, is that it depends on what the local authority budget actually is.  It is proportional to funding that comes from the local authority which the State quite often matches.  In County Louth we found that we were about &euro;1 million less than we should have been about a year ago.  The reason was that the economics of the council were significantly challenged by properties and land bought at the height of the boom that had become worthless, for which the loans had to be serviced.  On the point the witness is making about the housing adaptation grant being universally available, we should change the fact that councils have to give funding at all.  Let the State fund it entirely.  Older people suffer when the council budget does not include them in their list of needs.  We found that people would be waiting a year to get their grant.  The people who were getting it were those who were most ill, for example with cancer or significant heart disease, and people who would have been in institutional care.  There is a huge job of work to be done there.<\/p><p> I feel extremely strongly that fair deal should only be used for high-dependency patients.  Our society should exist in such a way that people only go into a nursing home when they are high-dependency patients and are practically bed-bound.  People should be able to be live in their communities and have their housing adapted as their needs develop.  If they need to move from a home they might go into what used to be called sheltered housing - I do not know what the correct in-phrase is for that now - where they can live independently but where a nurse or community worker comes in to see if Johnny is okay and if Mary took her tablets or whatever.  We need to make sure that people stay in their community as long as possible and that we support them in doing so.<\/p><p> Yesterday, I had a call from a lady whose mother had been looking after her father.  Both parents are in their 80s and the mother unfortunately had a very serious fall.  She is now in an acute hospital and there is nobody to look after the father.  He is independent in that he can live at home but he needs to be physically moved because he is in a wheelchair.  Both of them could end up in long-term care if the system is not in place to look after them.  I know the home care packages are being significantly increased.  We should establish a principle of citizens living independently in the home, with a housing adaptation grant to physically look after them and the home care packages to meet their bodily needs in terms of care, to keep them out of these nursing homes.  We have about 21,000 or 22,000 people in nursing homes.  A lot of them, to my knowledge, have a very poor life expectancy once they go in there.  The life expectancy is much longer if they live in the community.  That is a fact.  The care is much better in the community; I believe that is a fact, too.  <\/p><p> My wonderful constituency covers bits of counties Louth and Meath.  I find that a constituent in County Louth can get a specially adapted wheelchair in their home or nursing home if they need it.  However, a constituent in County Meath will never get one in their nursing home but will get it in their private home.  There are significant disadvantages depending on what county one lives in.  The care and support that is needed to maintain people in their homes is not universal across all of our administrations.<\/p><p> The points the witnesses have made have been very helpful to me.  I agree with what they are saying, and what they are saying is what I believe myself.  By their campaigning, their research and by being here today, they encourage all of us to fight a better fight.  I am probably the youngest person here today and, thank God, I am very mobile.  We all need to think about this as we get older.  We are going to live longer.  Most people born today are going to be 100 when they eventually say goodbye.  Imagine how powerful that would be for Deputies in 20 or 30 years time.  It is about caring for people, being aware and driving the agenda, not standing back.  We must fight the bureaucracy.<\/p><p>Getting through that damn bureaucracy is the biggest problem people have to face.  It changes from county to  county.  I found that the Department had loads of money available, certainly for the housing adaptation grant, but councils were not applying for it.  Although I do not have the response to hand, I tabled a parliamentary question seeking a comparison of the funding for housing adaptation grants given to all local authorities.  It is worth looking at that because some counties really fast-track the money they provide while others do not, which is not acceptable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#J00300","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Members, from their constituency experience, grasp what we are all trying to achieve.  I take the points Deputy O'Dowd makes about the adaptation grant and the desirability of having centralised guidelines rather than administering the system differently everywhere.  The process is very complex and difficult.  We have staff members who go out and sit with older people, fill out the forms, bring in architects and do all the work for them but the forms are continually returned with requests for a bit more of this or that.  There is no consistency nationwide in how it is administered and it is very hard to do.  A huge amount of effort has gone into making County Louth an outlier and a leader among age-friendly cities and counties.  In tandem with our colleagues in Age Action, Age Friendly Ireland and others, we are trying to make possible the implementation of the national positive aging strategy, which links all the Departments and creates a bias towards helping people to age at home.  There has been a huge increase in the number of people who approach us because they have retired into privately-rented accommodation.

I will call on my colleague Mr. Lynch, as the director of housing in Meath County Council, to speak about the overall budget for the housing adaptation grant but the difficulty is exactly as we say.  Generally, a critical incident occurs and then a fast-track application must become priority one.  It is rushed through and then priorities two and three, that is, the people who are trying to plan for aging, have to wait until they have a bad fall before something happens.  That is the biggest difficulty with the grant.  We should be planning for those needs.  We are doing a lot of work with the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design on features that should be built into housing.  These are often very simple things, like a downstairs wet-room, the removal of door saddles or proper door handles, which can make a house age-proof and can be preventative.  I agree with Deputy O'Dowd that the jargon around the application forms has been a bit of a burden for people.  There has also been an issue around waiting times for occupational therapists to sign off.  The Department has looked at that but there has not been consistency.  The Department has carried out a review of the design of the form in order that it can be more easily accessible for people who may have literacy issues.  I agree that a more consistent pattern is needed.  Our long-term goal is a situation in which we do not need to retrospectively fix houses because they all will be age-proofed.

We received an extra allocation of &euro;1.9 million in total, for which we had to bring almost &euro;400,000 into play.  Fortunately our circumstances permitted it.  However, I agree with Deputy O'Dowd's comment that 100% funding is required, because it is difficult, particularly for the smaller local authorities, to come up with matching funding.  As my colleague, Ms McGuigan, has said, the &euro;60 million represents the cost of not using the proper design in housing in the first place.

Deputy O'Dowd is lucky because Louth and Meath are on the map but Carlow is not.  I am concerned about that.  In my county, we have the Carlow Older Persons Forum and an older persons' council, both of which come under the age-friendly banner.  The biggest issue they face is funding.  The witnesses will be aware of the Leader programme and public participation networks, PPNs.  There should be funding for all bodies under the age-friendly banner.<\/p><p>It is a massive issue.  From speaking with the different groups I meet regularly, I am aware that funding is the biggest issue.<\/p><p> It is crucial to go back to grants for elderly people, in particular because it was changed from 60 to 65 without anybody knowing.  It just came into local authorities.  I was a councillor for 18 years and I always dealt with housing aid for the elderly, adaptation grants and other grants.  The age measure has been detrimental to elderly people.  Many people with whom I deal are in their early 60s but have had a stroke or some other thing has happened.  However, they are not qualifying for these grants.  As such, the first thing to address going forward is the age at which grants are applicable.  It is not acceptable to set the age at 66 years.  However, the issue with the grants themselves relates also to timescales and waiting periods for assessments.  There are massive issues even with handrails and stair lifts or seats for shower units.  One goes to the local authority and back to the health board and one waits.  I ask for the different groups represented here to engage in joined-up thinking through the health service, local authorities and the other groups to highlight this because it is not happening.<\/p><p> I acknowledge that the witnesses' bodies are trying to put a programme in place, but if one takes windows and doors, that is nearly gone.  I was always told that if one applied for windows and doors under the older persons forum, which is the only way to get the grant, it had to be on health and safety grounds.  If there was only a top opening, one would qualify.  However, that does not even happen now.  They are not passing it.  The funding is not there.  Do the witnesses meet with the Government on a regular basis?  Much of the funding has been taken away from the health boards through the local authorities.  What meetings do witnesses have with the Government and what sort of joined up thinking takes place?  What is going to happen?  I take the simple example of a ramp or a car parking space.  I am finding that even a parking space for an elderly person outside his or her house is becoming an issue with local authorities.  It is a big thing for an elderly person or a person who uses a wheelchair to have a designated parking space so that he or she can get near his or her home.  These are simple things but they are massive issues.<\/p><p> Local authorities are also falling down in the area of building houses for elderly people.  Every year, a certain number of houses should be built for elderly people, but it is not happening.  We are lucky if we get a few bungalows every year which should be given to the elderly.  It is not happening because there is so much demand.  People who have had cancer or who use a wheelchair must be considered, which is right.  One then has older people who were waiting for a house but cannot get it.  A massive survey should be carried out on elderly people who may be living a few miles from a town in a larger three or four-bedroom house.  We need to look at downsizing and to establish what can be made available for people to downsize to smaller houses with access to towns, doctors, shops and libraries.<\/p><p> What is the remit of the witnesses' groups going forward?  While it is welcome that there are different groups, what programme do they have together to work through the health service?  The biggest issue I see for elderly people currently relates to hospital appointments, whether that is for a check-up or day-patient appointment.  There are almost 800 people in Carlow-Kilkenny waiting to get into Kilkenny hospital for a day appointment or a small procedure.  There is a huge waiting list in relation to cataract procedures.  These are hugely important matters for elderly people but we are not dealing with them.  Can one of the witnesses fill me in as to how Carlow has been forgotten, which is a massive issue for me as a Carlow Senator?  What is proposed in relation to funding and working with different bodies?  I thank the witnesses.  While the points they have made are crucial, there are massive issues for the elderly which we need to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#M00600","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Carlow County Council has one of the best Age Friendly programmes.

That is not indicative of the landscape of the Age Friendly programme.  The programme is in all 31 local authority areas.  The first one to take it on was Louth County Council, shortly followed by Meath, Fingal, Cavan, Monaghan and Kilkenny.  Then, gradually, every other county council came on board.  Obviously, the Age Friendly programme has the resources to be able to help facilitate its roll-out.<\/p> <p>  One of the core principles behind it is that, oftentimes, there are many good elements working although they are inconsistent and patchy.  It might be working well in Mayo or Carlow but we need to learn from that.  The Age Friendly programme intended not to lobby or be combative but to ask older people to co-design solutions with us in order we could bring them to the senior stakeholders.  Accordingly, an older person's council was established in every local authority area along with a strategic alliance.  The strategic alliance, chaired by the chief executive of the local authority, involves a Garda chief superintendent, as well as senior personnel from the HSE, the education and training boards, NGOs, the private and public sectors and academia to collectively look at older people's priorities at local level.  At a national level, we are trying to give scale to the issues older people are raising and also ensure they are representative.  Older people are not a homogenous group.  Not all 70 year olds are able to walk 5 km or whatever the case may be.  Some have chronic conditions, dementia or suffer from rural isolation while others are active.  There are affluent older people and others in poverty.  We have tried to collectively get what the key issues are.<\/p> <p>  We bring together and meet the chief executive officers of the NGOs every three months to ensure we are sharing our different learnings and what we are doing.  There are 12 to 14 members across this who we meet every three months.  At national level, our oversight group has four departmental assistant secretaries, chief executives, a Garda assistant commissioner, the head of Chambers Ireland and a director from the HSE.  We are feeding up with the national issues.  We want to ensure those issues are representative.<\/p> <p>  We did not want to create pots of funding to do age-friendly things.  We wanted pots of funding to deliver services in an age-friendly way.  It is more about being creative with the budgets we already have, particularly in the context of housing.  For example, Carlow is one of the best counties for age-friendly parking.  Carlow County Council has designed the template which we can share with other local authorities.  It is like the mother and baby parking notice and is easily identifiable as a parking facility for those who may not qualify for a disability badge.<\/p> <p>  Many initiatives have been rolled out.  Some we have helped deliver directly.  Others we have put structure around.  In all projects, we try to scale up, replicate what works, share best practice and ensure there is consistency around the country.  We are also scaling up on what are the national priority issues which we are getting from the grassroots.  I agree with the Senator that, in principle, we need to have more resources at local level to ensure we can continue to provide local delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine McGuigan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>We are part of an alliance which comprises Age Action, Age and Opportunity, Third Age, the Hospice Foundation and the Senior Citizens Parliament.

We are sending one simple message on various policies to all the different political parties.  We work with the Department of Health on the national positive ageing strategy.<\/p><p>A subset of that encompassing four or five CEOs is meeting all the designated officers in each Department, be it transport or health, in connection with older people and trying to get some traction for the implementation of the national positive ageing strategy on the basis that a whole-of-Government approach is difficult to operate from one Department but, as NGOs, we can go between the different Departments because we do not have those statutory boundaries.  As an organisation, we have long realised that no one NGO can meet the needs of all populations.  While we have scaled, and plan to scale further on what we do, we also have a coalition of approximately 54 smaller community groups up and down the country where we provide technology, resources and training to other agencies.  Since the Senator is being local about it, that includes Kilkenny and Carlow Contact.  Ultimately, Kilkenny and Carlow Contact falls within our remit.  This promotes common practice and quality standards.  Ten organisations are on the one management information system we provide so the work done in Carlow will be the same as that done in Kilkenny, Donegal, Louth and Dublin and when people go into an acute hospital or look for services, we have information on what we are doing.<\/p><p> There is much to be done and much that we are trying to do to bring our sector together to demonstrate our responsibilities to work collectively in arenas such as this.  The challenge for us is always that there are so many of us in terms of what we are all doing.  There is a very significant amount of partnership and we are moving beyond partnership to how we align and coalesce strategically.  There is enough work for everybody but we also need to work with the political system to bring about the changes in the type of grants schemes and the types of housing we build so that these coalitions and this co-operation actually come to fruition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Moynihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523962800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Bond wish to make any comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#P00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>We are trying to look at collaboration in a range of different layers and levels and perhaps our challenge is capacity and mismatch.

That is a critical piece.<\/p> <p>  At the other end, a role we introduced in County Louth called c&uacute;ltaca involves working with older people to help them support themselves and produce their own plans.  This is growing across the country with the service co-ordination model.  It works in helping older people to see and plan early -  it is a case of \"a stitch in time, save nine\" - so we can be more preventative rather than reactive in some of the situations.  The capacity building we really need to work on is in middle management between the HSE and the local authority in terms of it becoming their job to work together and to be more integrated.  That is something that is new.  <\/p> <p>  The big challenge with regard to resources is whether we are introducing new money or if it is a case of pooling existing resources and trying to be more effective in sharing the budgets that are available and spreading them around.  That is a challenge.  We do not have a very good culture and history of pooling resources and perhaps we need to look at this aspect.  It is a resource-contrained world so the key energies come back to empowering people to be able to do more for themselves and to be able to build on the huge resource value that is there in volunteering that comes in to help support that kind of work.  It is cross-sectoral.

In County Louth and through the Age Friendly Ireland structure, we have got good at supporting and identifying what is wrong in the system and supporting it more effectively but we are not radically changing things in any way; it is more a case of making things that are in place work more efficiently rather than providing new models.<\/p><p> Through research and collaboration with partners at international conferences, we hear the conversations of colleagues.  At the gerontological society conference last year in San Francisco, it was agreed at one of our meetings on some of the presentations from a number of different countries that in 20 to 30 years time we will probably look back and say, for example, in relation to nursing homes: \"Did we actually tolerate that for so long?\"  There is this whole drive towards being more creative and having new models.

I stated there are more than 700 persons in Carlow-Kilkenny waiting for hospital appointments.  I do not know how many of them are elderly but maybe the elderly could be made a high priority, particularly if they are in pain.  Everybody is a priority but one hates to think of the elderly maybe not getting a lift or whatever.<\/p> <p>  It is appropriate that we say \"well done\" to the older persons' forum, particularly Mr. Joe Butler and those in Carlow who I would meet as often as I can.  On-street parking is important but my issue would be more within a housing estate where a person is elderly and cannot get his or her messages in. <\/p> <p>  I have highlighted that people, as they are getting older, are coming in looking for stoves and I am sure the witnesses are aware of this.  There is no Government scheme to provide grants for stoves.  If one is in a local authority house, one can avail of what is called the \"self-help\" scheme which qualifies one for half of it but then the person must come up with other half if he or she wants a stove.  If one is a homeowner, it is difficult to get stoves.  I am wondering whether the witnesses have found this but in the past few months, particularly with the winters having got so cold, many people have been coming to me on this matter.  I will put it on my priority list with the Minister but I wonder if the witnesses would also make that a priority.<\/p> <p>  There is something else I will ask them before I finish.

It would be worth taking a step back and reminding people why we are here today.  The Chair's proposal to have these sessions and for the committee to produce a report is very important, so it is not merely a case of the witnesses coming here and telling the committee what they think and us responding; the purpose of these hearings is for the Chair to author, and then the committee members to agree, a report with very specific recommendations on the policy or funding changes we want the Government to make.  My question relates to that part of our work, however I wish to respond to a couple of the debates and raise two of the biggest challenges which the witnesses have put to us which I hope will form a big part of our discussion on the other side of the hearings.<\/p> <p>  It is timely that we are having this meeting in the same week as Focus Ireland launches its campaign on older people and homelessness.  It is only one part of the picture but the fact that we have seen a 40% increase in the number of older people in emergency accommodation is shocking.  We are in a cycle where we think we cannot be shocked anymore by the numbers of homeless children or families.  It might sound like a small number, but the idea that there are 119 people in emergency accommodation is shocking.  The most shocking thing is how easy it would be to get those people out of emergency accommodation.  It is not as though we do not have 119 appropriate units somewhere in the country for those people.  I wanted to start by highlighting that campaign and urging people to support it. <\/p> <p>  In my constituency, I have found an increasing number of older people, people in their late 50s or early 60s, in mortgage difficulty or being forced into emergency accommodation often after a relationship breakdown.  That is an issue before we discuss the older people who have to move back in with their adult sons and daughters because of their own housing crises.  I suspect some of the figures that are disturbing us will get worse.  It is important for us to be mindful of that.  <\/p> <p>  On the adaptation grants, it is important to remember the &euro;60 million is not only for older people's adaptation grants but also for disability grants, which are a smaller portion of the figure.  In next year's budget the Government will have an extra &euro;3 billion of fiscal space and we could, for example, simply double the budget if the Government was of a mind to do so.  We all need to ask for more from the Government on the budget, particularly when it is such a small sum of money and those adaptations have a transformational impact on people's lives.  These are things such as getting a stair lift which allows someone to access half of their home, which they may not have been able to access for several years, or getting a downstairs shower or wet room.  I would like to see this committee recommend that in addition to reversing some of the negative changes to the grant, a significant increase be made in that grant to local authorities.  I would like to get some sense of where the witnesses would like to see us pitching this.  In my local authority area, one can wait three years for a grant.  That is not only for minor mobility aids, but also for serious adaptation work.  I am sure it is the same in other local authority areas, but I have constituents, whether local authority tenants or private home owners, who go through the very complicated process, are deemed eligible but then are put in a queue in which they can remain for three years.  These are people who have already had the crisis and are already waiting for the funds and suffer an additional wait.  The length of time people who have been approved for the grant have to wait is something that we need to highlight.<\/p> <p>  I am also concerned that local authorities and elected representatives on local authorities - and I include myself in this when I was a councillor -  do not have a good record on ensuring that when Part 8 social housing stock is being planned, there is both adequate provision for a sufficient supply of units to meet the needs of older people and to facilitate downsizing as a genuine choice rather than as something that is forced.  I would be interested in the witnesses' thoughts on this.  I have never been part of a conversation about age-friendly design in a local authority context.  Whatever about the private sector, to which I will return in a moment, we should look for local authority new builds - of which there will be 40,000 in the next couple of years - to have age-friendly design built into them at a minimum.        <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#R00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1523962800,"counter":416,"content":"<p>The committee report should deal with that significant matter.<\/p><p>One of the biggest issues the witnesses have raised relates to age-friendly design.  The committee needs to look at the cost implications and the best mechanism particularly in light of a new round of county development plans being proposed post the local elections next year.  Do we need to start insisting that these need not just to become options for social and-or private development, but need to become standards?  What would that cost?  What would those standards be?  We would need a lot of information on that.  If the witnesses have information today or if they can recommend experts who can provide that to us in oral or written sessions in the future, that would be really interesting.  The most compelling argument the witnesses make is that if this committee is to make a contribution to tackling the problem, age-friendly design is the priority.  We can talk about adaptation grants and other stuff but that is the number one issue.<\/p><p>The second issue is a problem not just for older people.  We need to see housing, particularly public or social housing, as more than bricks and mortar.  Local authority officials here will know that the community element of the housing department is always the poor relation and is always the smaller bit of the picture.  In other jurisdictions where they do public housing on a much bigger scale, the community element is an integral part of housing in terms of where people live and communities.<\/p><p>I would also be interested in any specific recommendations the witnesses believe we should consider beyond a more general recommendation that we need the HSE and local authorities to work together more.  How do we put that into policy?  What type of recommendations can we make?  The witnesses talked about a paradigm shift, but in our world we need specific ideas and propositions to advise Government as to what needs to happen in terms of policy delivery.<\/p><p>What further information can the witnesses give us on the cost of implementing regulations for age-friendly design?  What are the models of best practice?  What countries do it better?  What housing associations in Ireland are doing it well?<\/p><p>The witnesses were very generous in their comments on the two meagre references to older people in Rebuilding Ireland.  I ask for more information on what is happening with those recommendations.  My concern is that the scope of those recommendations is very limited.  If the committee were to make additional policy recommendations to Rebuilding Ireland, what should they be?<\/p><p>I have a question for the NGOs.  It is not about beating up on local government or central government.  I ask them to give us their sense of how poorly local and central government are placing the needs of older people in the overall hierarchy of needs in our housing crisis.  I am not trying to give people a hard time, but we have a crisis and given the things local authorities and central government have to respond to, it means other things get pushed down the line.  What would the witnesses like us to argue to be pushed back up the line of priorities?<\/p><p>We can publish a report with 100 recommendations, which is great.  However, 100 recommendations are much more difficult for us to push on Government.  Therefore, let us have 50 or 100 recommendations if they are required, but what are the witnesses' top five?  What would they like the committee to focus on not just what goes into a report, but what we can continually raise with Government in oral questions and committee meetings?  We need to have those highlighted as much as possible.  I believe the report of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness made 180 recommendations, but we chose 25 priority ones.  It would be useful to try to do something similar with this report.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising many of the issues which are coming up, particularly in terms of our client work, on the phone and from meeting our members.

They are mindful and are raising this as a priority issue well in advance of their need for it.  That cannot be overstated enough in terms of saying that because there is not clarity there.

That is a real problem.<\/p> <p>  Senator Murnane O'Connor referred to funding running out.  There has to be guaranteed funding for the year.  If there is not and if money runs out, people are then in a race.

The funding needs to be guaranteed for the year and that is a major priority.<\/p> <p>  We also need to remember that the disability grants cover different age cohorts and are not just for older people.  There are other grant schemes, such as the home improvement scheme for older people, and most of the calls we receive are actually about home improvements rather than home adaptations.  That may be because the level of grants is higher under the home improvement scheme rather than the home adaptation scheme.

I really like what he said about the five big-ticket items because that is what we are looking at.  He mentioned the housing adaptation scheme, a decent review of the scheme and a projection of the population growth in the existing housing stock, both in the private and social sector, in order to determine what we are going to require, so it is not reactive and a case of putting resources in whenever the critical incident happens.  To take up what Senator Murnane O'Connor said on having it open all year round, a person can have a bad fall in the month of June; it does not have to happen in the winter months.  There are definitely measures whereby such issues could be reviewed.  I agree that the purpose of this group is not to review the housing adaptation grant, HAG, the mobility aids grant, MAG, and housing aid for older people, HOP, because that is not what housing for older people is going to look like in the future.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked a number of questions.  Copies of the SLIOTAR housing research have been circulated to the Clerk.  We have all our publications online but I am happy to provide copies.  That particular research was a review of the Great Northern Haven, in which Mr. Bond was involved, and it looked at some of the models, such as support co-ordination in London and Germany.  Basically, 11 recommendations were made across the four considerations, such as the physical considerations of bricks and mortar, as well all the things Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about.  The fluffy side is so much more important now.  I refer, for example, to all of the community supports and activities that enable people to have transportation and social participation, which are so critical to housing, as well as the technology supports.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to the draft policy and the two actions in Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p><p>If one looks across multiple strategies and policies, in the rural development plan, for example, they look at brownfield sites over shops.  We have one project in Meath at the minute.  Mr. Lynch has a site right in the centre of town, within 300 m of the acute hospital and the pharmacy; it is a derelict site and there are four one-person dwellings going on it.  We have built in universal design, very simple things like a door entry system, Cat 5 cable to enable technology to go in, age-friendly parking right beside it for the rural transport company to take them to acute appointments.  That is a very small site, but a very replicable example.<\/p><p> When considering models, the housing agency and ourselves are looking at different models around the country so that we can put a proposal together, which includes mixed tenure and different allocations, not just social housing being built by local authorities.  There are ones being spearheaded, as Mr. Moynihan mentioned earlier, by local ambassadors, approved housing bodies, developers or whatever the case may be.  They are also included in that draft policy that the Department is going to produce.  We can certainly link that.<\/p><p> In terms of crunching down even further and looking at the universal design, a full suite of universal design, obviously, by virtue of what is there, is more costly.   What is mandated currently is part N on age-friendly design which would be extracting what we would feel is critical.  In that housing and public realm training that we spoke about earlier, we have been delivering that across all the local authority areas.  That is how we are getting in and saying this is what we need to be thinking about, this is what one needs to be cognisant of.  Even in Meath our whole county development plan is stitching in that age-friendly ethos.  We would like the next tranche of these plans to be taking the same approach.<\/p><p> Dr. Gerald Craddock, from the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design has helped to co-design our housing and public realm training.  He is also doing a piece of work with Cl&uacute;id Housing at the minute on a cost-benefit analysis.  This will enable us to look at how much more is it per square metre to build in an age-friendly way, to build universal design.  What is really important when you have the metrics and the figures, is to be able to say, if one does it this way this is what one save down the line.  That needs to be made attractive to developers or whoever is going to be doing the building work.<\/p><p> I will certainly be happy after this meeting to provide the Deputy with all of the publications, all of that research, because that particular SLIOTAR housing research is what we recommended the Department to put into their draft framework.<\/p><p> I think I have covered everything there.  I want to reiterate that the HAGs, MAGs and HOPs are very important and maybe Mr. Lynch may want to add to this.  We can increase the budget and keep it open but I do not believe it is going to be the big ticket item, in those top five. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine McGuigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I might just clarify the funding situation on the grants themselves.  Earlier in the year we usually get a letter from the Department saying that we can spend a percentage of last year's allocation, so we do not necessarily know what our allocation is until the middle of the year.  Later in the year we may get a top-up, depending if we are showing the ability to get through the grants and spend them.<br\/><br\/>The point I would make is that everyone would like to see more funding coming in but to return to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point about the waiting list, this is also a labour-intensive operation.  As a housing director, I know the people trying to deliver housing programmes are the same people having to send out to have the grants done.  Any budget should take account of the fact or should build in a percentage for staff resources to actually do these tasks and that this would help speed up the programme. <br\/><br\/>Obviously it is important to deal with these emergency situations but the future is about universal design, as Ms. Mc Guigan has said, and we are certainly trying to build that into our planning process.  <br\/><br\/>We could make a recommendation that for any housing schemes they should<i><\/i>be<i>pro rata<\/i>to population percentages.  If we have 10% elderly in the population, 10% should be dedicated to this group.  Certainly in our own Part 8 will be focusing on disabilities, particularly, but we will certainly cater for the same group, the elderly, as well.  It is all down to resources funding, capital funding and we need to recommend, as part of the overall Rebuilding Ireland targets, that we set a benchmark for the elderly, in terms of the projects that we bring forward.  That would certainly help the situation.  <br\/><br\/>I take the point that has been made about community. It is not always the poor relation and I know several housing authorities that have put housing and community together, including our own, but there is a good synergy.  It needs to be done between the two.  The activities of the age-friendly alliance, housing and community, the public participation network are all brought under the one department.  That is very important and it is the way to go in terms of how local authorities would be structured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1523962800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>Can I ask just one supplementary question relevant to that?<\/p><p>The Minister has made a big play about his new central Government standards for apartments, which obviously will have an impact in terms of the county development plans.

In respect of homelessness, the Deputy is correct in that the seeds for the next homeless crisis among older people are there on the basis of the rental issue.  There is no long-term security for anybody in rental.  We are heading to a position in urban centres where up to 50% of people may rent in the future and the number of people who are over 65 and are renting has gone up 28% since 2011.  As the age group below that has gone up by higher percentages, we will have an awful lot of people in this old age category.  One of the aforementioned five big-ticket items may relate to long-term leases.  In long-term leases, one always has the right to sell the property and so on.  As noted earlier, we have been inviting in institutional investors - professional landlords- to meet the need and there seems to be no reason such people operating at that scale cannot give long-term leases to give people the security that is available in other countries.  Otherwise, one will have an awful lot of older people looking for homes.<\/p> <p>  At present, 90% of all the older people in our housing are coming from homeless services, which traditionally was not the situation.  There are approximately 35 older people for each house and 35 people over 70 years all trying to get into one house is not a good queue to be facing.  When they try to obtain private rented accommodation in their 70s, they turn up, usually on their own and perhaps try to pay the rent with housing assistance payment, HAP.  They are just not attractive to the private sector.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, the only people who can ramp up to this scale are probably the local authorities.  They are the only people who can build at the scale that this requires.  We are an approved housing body, AHB, and have plans to deliver another 500 units in the next five years.  That is only the tip of the iceberg and it is for all of the AHBs. The councils, therefore, need to do this.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the age-friendly design, my understanding is that one is looking at an additional cost of approximately 3%.  Because the structures are well built, my understanding is that over the lifetime of the building, which is around 40 years, one recoups that money on the basis that adaptations or changes do not have to be made during the person's lifetime.  As Mr. Bond said earlier, one then is building for everybody because getting older is the best outcome and hopefully is a journey we are all on.<\/p> <p>  It is cheaper in the long run.  Consequently, the second item I would choose is that universal or age-friendly design.  In that regard, we always are worried when we hear about lowering standards to invite other people in.  There are high returns on rent and on property circulation but we are lowering the standards now.  We are currently working on one development where we are taking an old unit built 30 years ago and are refurbishing it by turning it into one of these two-into-one dwellings.  I refer to people living in an area of 280 sq. ft.  We look at such developments built 25 years ago and we probably ask what people were thinking.  As we lower the standards, I would be concerned that perhaps in ten or 15 years' time people will look at us and ask what we were thinking.  It is a short-term thing as the lifespan is 40 years.<\/p><p>On what we can do, I offer the commitment that when we are talking to the other non-governmental organisations in putting our pre-budget submission together, we will all put in the same proposal for alterations to the grant scheme and give a consistent and clear message of our different experiences.  If we agree on five things, we should submit five things.  If there are three things we do not agree on, we should leave them out.  That is the type of thing we have to try to do.  An inch is better than a mile if it is in the right direction.<\/p><p> Regarding Rebuilding Ireland, there are two major concerns for older people of which downsizing is one.  Only 13% of older people live in housing with more than seven rooms.  That includes kitchens, living rooms and sitting rooms.  I am slightly concerned that this is like the issue of vacant housing.  We could send downsizing officers all over the country, taking resources away from public officials while looking for things that may not exist.  Individuals who downsize at the moment are generally couples in good health with a very substantial asset.  In most cases, they will probably manage it themselves.  We want downsizing to be a choice, but the choices will probably have to be built first.  It is the other way around. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#V00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Moynihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523962800,"counter":428,"content":"<p>It has to be a choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#W00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":429,"content":"<p>The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, produced a report on downsizing a couple of years ago that probably claimed the narrative in this area.   However, the report was commissioned by Bank of Ireland and the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  I will leave it there.<\/p> <p>  That is where we come to Rebuilding Ireland.  We need to age-proof it.  We want all families and children to have housing and homes.  Single people and couples are behind them on the list however, and that is the majority of people coming through.  That is the long-term view.  As the legislators, the committee members are the ones who must look five, ten or 15 years ahead.  In fairness to the public officials, when visiting the Department one finds they are overwhelmed with the responsibilities they already have.  When we mention older people's housing, it seems that they are up to here and they cannot take any more.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, what we are trying to do is to work out the demand for these measures.  The committee should take notice of our responsibility and accountability.  We have a situation where there is a lot of capacity-building.  There is a lot of discussion, and there is much commonality in the views of different people.  The messages are consistent from politicians, NGOs and councils.  We need to turn that into a bias towards action on the ground.  That means looking at things like demand and where it arises.  We need to ask who, what, when, where and how.  That will produce figures for varieties of housing that are quite uncomfortable and difficult to deal with but at least by having those numbers we will understand the challenge that we can collectively work on.<\/p> <p>  If we provide housing for older people, we are in the support business.  That is the way I put it.  In a large cohort of older people, a percentage will be very active and independent at any one time, and a percentage will need support.  It is critical to bring those supports to bear through the housing.  There needs to be a national framework.  As Mr. Bond kindly mentioned, we are trying to roll out navigators, people who can help older individuals navigate multiple complex systems so that they can age at home.  That might include transport, housing, health or anything else.  It is important to help them age at home and build the supports around them.  <\/p> <p>  From Mr. Bond's pioneering work, we have taken on some of the proactive technology that Netwell has developed.  Again, assistance technology is something that everybody agrees on and we are currently rolling it out.  We are trying to bring these approaches to scale, but there must be funding streams and support for them.  The point of an NGO is that we help define the problems and then we help demonstrate the solutions.  We need the support to bring them to scale and in many cases that is what we are missing.  I note that there is so much we can agree on and I ask the committee members to create a bias towards action in their report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Moynihan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the insightful questions.  Innovation is happening, but our challenge is that is very piecemeal.  It is happening in different places at different speeds.<\/p><p>This morning, I heard that a new housing programme in Louth will request developers to respond with universal design standards, so things are starting to happen in that area.  We need to programme it and to put a wider frame across such innovations, to encourage sharing and to have closer and more in-depth collaborations.<\/p><p> On the question of the situating of age-friendly housing, I think of our key policy of a few years ago which was to build sustainable neighbourhoods.  I do not know if we have had a chance to see if, ten or 15 years later, they have cohesion and are holding together with all the mobility and labour market pulls and pushes.  Are sustainable communities sustaining themselves?<\/p><p> It is important to embed age-friendly practices but this is a challenge across Europe.  The core components will look different from traditional housing standards, which were around ergonomics and the size of flats, etc.  They will include location, neighbourhoods and access to services such as transport.  The guidelines need to be contextual and we will need to look at community connectivity, etc.<\/p><p> We need to put a lot of work into the digital dimension and the extent to which technology is embedded.  There are core challenges around broadband infrastructure to support services but technology is changing so fast that there will be issues around procurement and supply.

If we leave them to 31 or 32 local authorities, there will be differences across the country.  I agree that it is much easier to design these things at the beginning rather than retrofit them.  As Mr. Moynihan said, a 3% cost over the lifetime of a building is nothing and it is much more costly to retrofit after 30 years.  Much of the stuff we did is working today.  Doors are wider and access is much easier.  A walk-in shower is now in fashion, whereas years ago we favoured a cubicle.  Nowadays everyone wants a wet room and this is integrated seamlessly into designs.<\/p> <p>  Everyone has mentioned the housing adaptation grant and there are, indeed, huge inconsistencies across local authorities.  Even within local authorities, people do not fully understand how a decision was made as to why some person got it while some other person did not.<\/p><p>However, I am more concerned about the people who are not aware that these grants are available to them.  We have all encountered such people.  We have knocked on doors and met elderly people who are not aware that there is funding available to assist them.  That is something we must address.  I met a couple in their 80s in my constituency office who were trying to get exterior insulation for their house, but it is a terraced house and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, will not grant it.  No matter what they put into their house, they are wasting their time.  It is a solid block wall and they cannot insulate it.  Sometimes we have to be able to bend the grants to suit genuine applicants such as that couple.  I have looked everywhere for them but I cannot get anything for them.  They cannot heat their house and because it is a terraced house and the other neighbours will not do the wraparound insulation, they do not qualify for it.<\/p><p> When I look back on the facilities that were available in my county about 40 years ago, I sometimes think that people were more aware then of the housing needs of elderly people.  In my community, the town council in Wicklow built Crinion Park, a scheme of 40 or 50 houses beside the old health board.  People wanted to move there.  I am not sure which witness mentioned it but if we build these facilities, people will want to move into them.  Sadly, the health board has gone so Crinion Park is sitting there and is not being utilised to its full extent.  The other example was in the small rural town of Carnew.  Carnew Community Care, again built by champions of the community, now has 28 supported living houses.  That was built in the 1980s.  There is a supportive day care centre and people want to move into them.<\/p><p> I believe that we should get the standards right from the first day, rather than retrofit them.  If we can build the homes that people want to move into, rather than forcing them to move into them, we will begin to tackle the grant.  However, we are a long way from doing away with the housing adaptation grant.  If we had a hundred times the amount of funding, we still would not have enough.  It will be there for a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#X00400","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1523962800,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I will not go near the housing adaptation grants.  However, I have focused on this issue for many years and since I was elected to the D&aacute;il I have been doing a fair amount of work and research on the area.  When one considers the statistics for the next 20 years or so, which show that we will have 1.4 million people over 65 years of age, we have a prime opportunity here to make a difference in the next number of years, whether that is through purpose built units, addressing the issue with the current stock or giving people other options.  I recognise that people might not want to downsize but I believe that is because there are no options available to them to do so.  There are models across Europe and the US.  I visited a couple of them in the US, probably 14 years ago, and some in Europe to get a sense of what we can deliver here.  With regard to Great Northern Haven, how long did it take to deliver that from conception to turning the key?<\/p> <p>  My local authority in D&uacute;n Laoghaire has some fantastic models of purpose built units, such as in Rochestown House, where people could downsize.  However, it was not so much that they want to downsize as it is to help with the financial burden and financial security.  Most members of the committee canvas regularly and, particularly in winter, we see the number of single occupant houses, be they private or social houses, where people are living in one or two rooms in the house.  That is because of the cost of maintaining the property.  It is general knowledge that if there are options available, people generally do not wish to move more than a kilometre away from where they currently live because that is their community.  They want to stay there because that is where they feel they have security, friendships and consistency.  It is about quality of life for people.<\/p> <p>  I wish to focus on what purpose built options we can deliver, whether on State-owned land or by encouraging private developers to come forward with schemes.  I am aware that some are already doing that.  To be parochial again, although I doubt that I will mention D&uacute;n Laoghaire as many times as Carlow has been mentioned, there is a mixed tenure scheme in Shankhill for 540 units.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is familiar with it.  As part of that, we want to provide step-down units, both public and private, on that site.<\/p><p> Regardless of size, all houses on private developments - whether they have one, two, three or four bedrooms - must be age friendly.  This will allow people living in three or four bedroom starter homes to downsize in the same development when their children leave home.  The Rebuilding Ireland programme aims to achieve this objective through mixed tenure developments.  I accept, however, that this is taking a long time to realise.<\/p><p> Last year, the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, held a competition on homes for smart ageing.  Even simple measures in the areas of design and construction can help.  For example, few people think of installing saddle boards and hand rails.  Moreover, when a house is being built the installation of an additional rolled steel joist, RSJ, will facilitate an extension to the side or back of the property 20 or 30 years later at substantially lower costs than would otherwise be the case.  Additional structures could be provided to develop the property for split living or another purpose.  The point is that properties can be adapted to meet the householder's needs at different times in his or her life. <\/p><p> I presume Mr. Lynch is familiar with many of the build to lease initiatives.  Many build to rent properties are also coming on stream and we need to tap into this approach to a greater extent.  If the proposed development in Cherrywood secures planning permission, the first phase will include build to rent properties. <\/p><p> While increasing construction costs by 3% may not seem significant to us, we must be careful as we have a housing crisis and we are trying to get banks to fund developers.  Profit may be a bad word to some but developers need to make money from developing sites and offering houses at an affordable price point.  An additional 3% in the cost on construction could be a barrier to development.  We need to find imaginative ways to reduce this figure.  I do not have all the answers but if we decide to require developers to build to age-friendly standards at an additional cost of 3%, we will have to sell that requirement in a way that does not place a further burden on the construction industry.  I am being pragmatic and realistic in that regard.<\/p><p> We also need to tackle rural and suburban isolation.  The organisations represented today are doing considerable work in this area.  State-owned land will play a vital role if we are to develop housing for this purpose.  I have been pushing hard to have State-owned land used to build housing for older people.  A fantastic scheme under way in Ballinteer will provide older people with an option, although we are not trying to get people to move out of their homes if they do not want to do so.  We are simply seeking to give them further options in terms of quality of life and help with financial security.  We have a long way to go in this area but all sides have shown a willingness to deliver.  A tremendous amount of work is being done locally, not only by local authorities but also by the various organisations involved in this area.  The older people network in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is a superb organisation.  I have ongoing engagement with a number of organisations on the policy initiatives I wish to advance. <\/p><p> A number of other issues were raised, including by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  We want to give people security and choice.  The issue is one of providing options.  Whether this is done by the private or public sector makes no odds to me.  This is about providing homes for people who are flexible throughout their lives.  None of us knows what we will face tomorrow or the next day.  I fully agree with the point made regarding the adaptation grants.  None of us knows whether we will fall tomorrow or in six months.  If a house, home or unit is built in a way that recognises that these things can happen, it eases the burden on the health care and home help systems.<\/p><p> We hope to have representatives of Home Instead and the Royal Institute of Architects before the joint committee in the weeks ahead.  We have also written to Cl&uacute;id and a number of other organisations seeking submissions.  I have read the majority of the submissions the committee has received thus far.  The issue now is one of formulating action.  I am biased towards action because all the research has been done and it is now time to formulate ways of delivering.  It would probably be easier to have five points at the beginning, especially if we are trying to filter down into local authorities, which have a significant role to play in this regard.<\/p><p>The local authorities do not need a mandate from the Department to do this.  I believe there is a willingness there already to do this.  We need our local elected representatives to come on board and, where Part 8s come forward, to agree to those breakdowns between social and private units and what is accessible.<\/p><p> I want to thank you all for coming here this morning and for the information that has been shared by the witnesses with the committee and the ongoing engagement that we have with many of those in attendance.<\/p><p> I really want to know what are the options that we can build now.  Are they assisted living where we give over the first two or three floors in an apartment block to those supports and communal services where people live in self-contained apartments?  Or is it stand-alone homes for people that will adapt throughout the next 20 or 30 years of their lives.  I think we will be able to manage the mixed-tenure option and ensure that any developments coming forward will be age-friendly.<\/p><p> We should not even have to think of Part N.  It should be a given that every unit is adaptable and flexible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#Y00200","speaker":"1246","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Thank you Chairman and members.  A lot of ground has been covered in those comments.  The first thing I wish to reply on is the different models.  I have mentioned the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design and if the committee is going to invite other organisations to attend that would be a critical question.  In respect of the 3% additional cost, in particular, that can be really be explained because with the additional dividends that arise, one will quickly see that percentage addressed when one is located beside a primary care location.  The overall fund decreases because one is cutting costs where there is proximity to services.  There is a reduction of the burdens, a decrease in missed hospital appointments and all of those kinds of issues.  Dr. Craddock would be able to encapsulate these issues and show the key things that need to be included.  Making this part of planning requirements at local level rather than by way of a mandate encourages competitiveness.<br\/><br\/>One of the local authorities we work with has written age-friendly or accessibility provisions into its procurement guidelines so that anything that arises, be it a housing development or buying a photocopier, is included at local level.  The SLIOTAR report that I sent to the committee, demonstrates that one can be flexible at local level to encourage this approach and to encourage a level of competitiveness.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Casey talked about standards.  The housing and public realm training that we have delivered to all of the local authorities was also recently delivered to 21 officials within the Department.  The Assistant Secretary, who is on our oversight group, said it is really important that we understand what is coming down the line, and where we can be creative and work better with local government, particularly in terms of planning.<br\/><br\/>One of the issues referred to was standardised design, some of which has already been captured.  There are many examples of this.  One of these is where the housing supports have been developed by Dublin City Council with a number of different agencies.  This is going to be launched as an example of the methodology and how they came up with it.  <br\/><br\/>We need to be aware as well of where there is a density problem and of the differences between urban and rural.  If one wants to build an older person's suite of housing and give choice in a small rural town, that is quite different from Dublin city centre.  We really need to be cognisant of sprawling populations too.  Older people will say choice needs to be made available.  People cannot have the grandchildren to stay over in a one bedroom apartment; that is not going to be sustainable.  We need to proceed<i>pro rata<\/i>on the basis of where the density is but it needs to be realistic.  We must provide proper choice and ensure people have access to services but that they still have space if they want to have family coming and going.<br\/><br\/>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was one of the examples I quoted in the presentation.  I know I went through it fairly rapidly but it actually does have a questions and answers facility.  If one is interested in downsizing, one can ring the local authority and talk to them about the various options.  That is something that could be replicated and is available in some local authorities already where people can ask what their options are.  It is the same if people want to know what supports are in place for their ageing parents who may not be able to manage.  People want answers to the following: What is a home-care package?  What is the rural transport programme? What events are on?  Mr. Bond talked about earlier in his submission about support co-ordination, the C&uacute;ltaca role, being able to provide that information at local level and this is what D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is doing.<\/p><p>If we look at the projections and choices that need to be made available and then respond to that, it speaks to the issue referred to by the Deputy of lifetime communities and mixed tenure, with three bedroom and four bedroom houses and two bedroom apartments, with a warden on site and with good access.  People can live in those communities for years on end.<\/p><p> I really want to press home that piece around universal design because it is more cost-effective in the long run.  The competition that was run last year was won by Abhaile.  It is a lovely option and that would have been replicated in the Georgian quarter in Limerick, where older people might have three or four storey houses, parts of which can be converted so they can continue to live there.  Much information has been garnered through those competitions and the case studies that have been worked through by the Department which we can share to see how this can be replicated across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine McGuigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I would like to make a point on State-owned land, which affects the housing programme.  At present, if one wants to transfer land from one State body to another, the Valuation Office has to value the land and money has to change hands, which in the case of a local authority probably means borrowing money and going through the elected members.  It would be preferable if transfers could be facilitated without having to go through that process.  In fairness, the Valuation Office has to revalue the entire country and it will have a difficulty in getting around to individual land transactions.  It struck me that there might be a case to be made to reduce the VAT rate on construction for age-friendly-type developments from 13.5% to, say, 10%, which might allow that cost to be absorbed without increasing the price to the retail purchaser at the end.  Perhaps something could be done within tax policy to achieve that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#BB00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Lynch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>To pick up on Deputy Casey's comment, bending and tolerance are issues we have to be conscious of.  Sometimes our rules and regulations become so tight that they do not allow flexibility .  One of the real shames is that, in many instances, home adaptation does not add value to the house and when the house goes back on the market, the first thing that happens is that all the stuff is brought back out of it again.  That is a measure of failure in regard to our design, so we need some tolerance around what is appropriate in the context of building.<\/p> <p>  There was a question around bringing the Great Northern Haven into being.  While I am not sure it is appropriate, I would like to extend an invitation to the committee to come to Dundalk, if it makes sense at any point.  In terms of timing, the building went to tender at the very peak of the construction period in 2007, construction started in 2008 and people moved in at the beginning of 2010.  We have to recognise that was a different time as it was just pre-boom and bust, and we also have to recognise the contribution of Atlantic Philanthropies, which helped to address some of the incremental costs that might have delayed decision making around the kind of project we did if that additional resource was not there.  That type of funding is not in play now.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that was central was local leadership in regard to driving it through.  We have talked before about characteristics such as location and brownfield sites.  For us, this was very important as they are two bedroom facilities, with a focus on autonomous living, but done in such a way that the apartments are clustered close together, which addresses many of the concerns.<\/p> <p>  In regard to how we might bring forward age-friendly standards, it is important for us not to be too prescriptive around the boundaries.  If we were able to bring in some key principles and values, and some goal-based dimensions, that could allow the creativity and innovation of designers to respond to it without being constrained by too much red tape.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018041700002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rodd Bond"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1523962800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>We would reiterate the point just made in terms of not being too prescriptive as to the specifics and also, coming back full circle to the initial presentation, we would point out that we are not dealing with a homogenous group.

People like us are trying to reimagine the community by tapping into volunteer support.  Our aim in the next few years is ultimately to increase to some 9,000 volunteers to support older people so those supports and that information is available on a one-to-one basis, and to leverage what already exists while campaigning or working with partners to get other services in place.<\/p> <p>  Housing with Support, which comes under Rebuilding Ireland, is one designated project to which we are the supplier.  The Departments of Health, and Housing, Planning and Local Government have worked very hard, but it has taken three years to get to a point of agreement on how it will be built and the standards.  The housing agencies are now trying to produce a report on a model that can be replicated.<\/p> <p>  As an approved housing body, we are one of the 16 agencies that are Housing Finance Agency-approved.  The way it currently works is that we have to identify the site and purchase it, and there is a huge amount of investment and work to be done to get something across the line.  Many people are working to smooth all of that but we still need more consolidation.  While I am avoiding the word \"bureaucracy\" on purpose because there are many people who work very hard in this area and are doing their best, there certainly needs to be support for those individuals to push forward.  This is why we come back to having demand-type numbers so we can look by area and say what are the needs for clusters of housing for older people per area.  The Department of Education and Skills recently announced it has the statistics on the growth in the number of children, so it knows in advance to put schools in place.  We have no such system in regard to the demand for housing and it is ultimately about reimagining the resources available and how we plan.  The development in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that was just described sounds exactly like what we want for every housing estate.  Regardless of who is the developer, whether it is public, private or an AHB, it should be built to represent the demographics of the area and allow people to age in their own community and move around the corner if they so choose.<\/p> <p>  On the age-friendly issue, money is always an issue but when we break it down by average build cost, it is probably &euro;7,000 per unit.<\/p><p>If something has a life span of 40 years, and as proposed by Mr. Lynch, there are ways around finding that &euro;7,000 per unit.

Faoi l&aacute;thair, aon rud a dh&eacute;anann siad, aon rud a ritheann an Chomhairle agus an Pharlaimint in &eacute;ineacht a ch&eacute;ile, aon treoir, aon rialach&aacute;n n&oacute; aon chinneadh a ritheann siad, b&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin i nGaeilge chomh maith leis na teangacha oifigi&uacute;ila ar fad eile.  Tagann na togra&iacute; os comhair Pharlaimint na hEorpa i nGaeilge chomh maith le gach teanga oifigi&uacute;il eile.  T&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; st&aacute;dais ag dl&iacute; an Aontais Eorpaigh i nGaeilge seachas dl&iacute; na Parlaiminte seo i nGaeilge, agus n&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom gur f&eacute;idir leis sin seasamh, mar t&aacute; droch-chuma air.  T&aacute; an st&aacute;das sin thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach don t&iacute;r seo, mar a thuigimid go l&eacute;ir, faoi go bhfuaireamar r&eacute;idh leis an maol&uacute;, go mbeadh an Ghaeilge l&aacute;n-oifigi&uacute;il agus go mbeadh rann&oacute;ga m&oacute;ra aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in sna hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute; ar fad.<br\/><br\/>Ceann de na c&uacute;iseanna go ndearnadh &eacute; sin, agus ba cheart d&uacute;inn &eacute; sin a cheili&uacute;radh, n&aacute; ar mhaithe le l&iacute;on na n&Eacute;ireannach sna hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute;.

Cuireann s&eacute; sin go m&oacute;r le seasamh na t&iacute;re seo ag an Aontas Eorpach, go bhfuil &Eacute;ireannaigh ann gur f&eacute;idir leo dul i dteagmh&aacute;il leo is a r&aacute;, cogar, n&iacute; fheadar an bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; ruda&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh d&oacute;ibh.

Tuigeann siad an m&eacute;id sin agus caithfidh siad a thuiscint nach f&eacute;idir leis sin seasamh, nach f&eacute;idir leis an nGaeilge a bheith ina teanga oifigi&uacute;il oibre sa Bhruis&eacute;il, i Lucsamburg ag i Strasbourg agus &iacute; mar orn&aacute;id sa t&iacute;r seo.

N&iacute; f&eacute;idir le teanga a bheith leathoifigi&uacute;il ag leibh&eacute;al Eorpach.  Is l&eacute;ir gur f&eacute;idir sa t&iacute;r seo, ach i saol na ndaoine f&aacute;sta, n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn teanga leathoifigi&uacute;il.  Cuirfear na riar&aacute;ist&iacute; ar fad ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge.

An rud a bh&iacute; ann go dt&iacute; seo n&aacute; go rachadh duine isteach ag Gaeilgeoireacht agus bheadh an taobh eile ag B&eacute;arl&oacute;ireacht.  Bheadh an breitheamh ar a chomp&oacute;rd leis an mB&eacute;arla, mar ba &eacute; sin an taith&iacute; a bh&iacute;odh acu, agus bheadh caint an &eacute;ilitheora ag seasamh amach.

In ainneoin sin, d&eacute;anann gach duine dh&aacute; theanga ar a laghad - n&oacute; bh'f&eacute;idir tr&iacute; n&oacute; ceithre theanga - ar an me&aacute;nscoil.  De ghn&aacute;th tagann siad amach agus bheadh idir leibh&eacute;il B1 agus B2 acu, is iad sin leibh&eacute;il an fhoghlaimeora chumasaigh.  Leis an meon aonteangach B&eacute;arla at&aacute; sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s a leas&uacute; agus a bhriseadh, bheinn ag moladh nach bhfaighfidh aon dhuine aon phost sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s tar &eacute;is d&aacute;ta &aacute;irithe mura mbeadh dh&aacute; theanga acu go dt&iacute; leibh&eacute;al B2.  B'fh&eacute;idir go nd&eacute;arfa&iacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; sin pas crua, ach n&iacute;l s&eacute;.  Sin an gn&aacute;thrud a bheadh ar si&uacute;l in aon t&iacute;r eile san Aontas Eorpach.  N&iacute; g&aacute; go mbeadh an Ghaolainn mar an dara theanga, ach bheadh Gaolainn ag go leor daoine.  Cuireann go leor daoine at&aacute; in aghaidh cur le h&uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaolainne san earn&aacute;il phoibl&iacute; an cheist c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfoghlaim&iacute;tear Fraincis n&oacute; Gearm&aacute;inis.<\/p> <p>Is &eacute; an freagra at&aacute; air sin n&aacute; gur f&eacute;idir Frainc&iacute;s n&oacute; Gearmainis a fhoghlaim.  T&aacute; daoine le Frainc&iacute;s agus Gearm&aacute;inis ag teast&aacute;il &oacute;n St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.  Caithfimid dul ag pl&eacute; agus comhghuaill&iacute;ochta&iacute; a fhorbairt ar fud fad an Aontais Eorpaigh.  Teasta&iacute;onn daoine uainn gur f&eacute;idir leo dul agus labhairt le daoine ina dteanga fein san Ung&aacute;ir, sa R&oacute;m&aacute;in, sa Pholainn, san Iod&aacute;il, sa Fhrainc agus sa Sp&aacute;inn agus n&iacute;l an c&oacute;ras oideachais ag cur &eacute; sin ar f&aacute;il faoi l&aacute;thair mar gheall nach bhfeictear do na mic l&eacute;inn go mbeadh aon &uacute;s&aacute;id acu do na teangacha sin amach anseo.  Beidh muid th&iacute;os leis mar n&iacute; bheidh muid &aacute;balta brath ar Shasana le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; a bhr&uacute; chun cinn d&uacute;inn ag leibh&eacute;al na Comhairle san Aontas Eorpach a thuilleadh.  Beidh orainn comhghuaill&iacute;ochta&iacute; a chur ar bun sinn f&eacute;in agus n&iacute; dh&eacute;anfaimid &eacute; sin m&aacute; bh&iacute;onn muid i dtaobh le B&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, molaimse nach bhfost&oacute;fa&iacute; daoine sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s feasta gan leibh&eacute;al bun&uacute;sach de dh&aacute; theanga ar a laghad acu.  Leas&oacute;dh agus d'athr&oacute;dh s&eacute; sin an meon at&aacute; againn maidir le teangacha agus n&iacute; bheadh muid ag &uacute;tam&aacute;il le c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad duine at&aacute; againn le Gaeilge.

Chabhr&oacute;dh s&eacute; sin go m&oacute;r le cur i bhfeidhm an Achta agus taisp&eacute;ainfeadh s&eacute; don phobal gur leis an t-Acht.

T&aacute; fadhb anseo le hearca&iacute;ocht.  T&aacute; mo chuid r&aacute;ite agam faoi sin.  M&aacute; leanfaim&iacute;d orainn ag fost&uacute; daoine nach bhfuil ach teanga amh&aacute;in acu, n&iacute; thiocfaidh aon athr&uacute; n&aacute; feabhas air sin.<\/p> <p> Maidir le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht, t&aacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta ann.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag pl&eacute; le plean&aacute;il teangan faoi l&aacute;thair.  T&aacute; for&aacute;il in Acht na Gaeltachta 2003 go bhf&eacute;adfadh an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il thar ceann comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; eile.  Molaimse gur cheart go mbeadh air seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; plean&aacute;la a chur ar f&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht agus go mbeadh &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta mar &uacute;dar&aacute;s plean&aacute;la fisici&uacute;la don Ghaeltacht.  Mar gheall air sin bheadh dualgas air faoin Acht Plean&aacute;la cur le l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; Gaolainne sa Ghaeltacht agus cur le h&uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Bheadh s&eacute; ag dr&eacute;acht&uacute; pleananna forbartha don Ghaeltacht seachas go mbeadh an Ghaeltacht, mar a tharla, i mbearna.  T&aacute; bearna anois maidir le freastal ar riachtanais tith&iacute;ochta chathair na Gaillimhe mar gheall gurb &eacute; sin an chloch is m&oacute; at&aacute; ar ph&aacute;idr&iacute;n na n-&uacute;dar&aacute;s &aacute;iti&uacute;il a dhr&eacute;achtaigh an plean.  D&aacute; mbeadh &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta ag cur seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; plean&aacute;la ar f&aacute;il, bheadh a mhalairt de sc&eacute;al ann.  Is bun agus barr an sc&eacute;il a bheadh ann n&aacute; an &aacute;it a fhorbairt mar Ghaeltacht agus cur le labhairt agus &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaolainne ann.<\/p> <p> Chomh maith leis sin, d'fh&eacute;adfadh an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; an Aire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Fosta&iacute;ochta agus Coimirce S&oacute;isiala&iacute; agus seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; an Aire Talmha&iacute;ochta, Bia agus Mara a sheachadadh sa Ghaeltacht.  Feictear dom gurb iad sin na Ranna is m&oacute; a bh&iacute;onn ag pl&eacute; le muintir na Gaeltachta.  D&aacute; mbeadh an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s ag seachadadh na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; thar ceann an d&aacute; Roinn sin, is cinnte gur tr&iacute; Ghaolainn a dh&eacute;anfa&iacute; &eacute; agus bh&eacute;if&iacute; ag cur fosta&iacute;ochta ar f&aacute;il go h&aacute;iti&uacute;il do mhuintir na h&aacute;ite ina teanga f&eacute;in.  T&aacute; fosta&iacute;ocht tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaolainne sa Ghaeltacht fite fuaite le cumas daoine leis an teanga maireachtaint ansin.  Chonaiceamar &eacute; sin i Rinn Ua gCuanach, &aacute;it a bhfuil f&aacute;s tar &eacute;is teacht ar l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; Gaolainne mar gheall go bhfuil Nemeton, comhlacht closamhairc, ag feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaolainne.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir an d&aacute; rud a dheighilt &oacute;na ch&eacute;ile.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; rud agam mar gheall ar leas&uacute; ar sceideal an phr&iacute;omh-Achta.  Molaim go mbeadh an sceideal ar aon dul leis an Acht um Shaor&aacute;il Faisn&eacute;ise 2014 agus go mbeadh gach ball St&aacute;it istigh faoin Acht teanga go uathoibr&iacute;och.  T&aacute; rud eile agam ar deireadh agus ansin beidh mo chuidse r&aacute;ite agam.  T&aacute; moladh agam mar gheall ar chosc ar thoirmeasc ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge san ionad oibre.  Tharla s&eacute; faoi dh&oacute; go poibl&iacute; le bliain anuas gur cuireadh cosc ar dhaoine an Ghaolainn a labhairt san &aacute;it oibre.  D&uacute;radh le fear &oacute;n Moilt&iacute;n a bh&iacute; ag obair i gCorcaigh gan aon Ghaolainn a labhairt san &aacute;it oibre agus cuireadh &eacute; &oacute;na phost mar gheall air sin.  Tuigim go bhfuil cuins&iacute; ann agus go bhfuil c&aacute;sanna ar leith ina mbeadh g&aacute; d'ionad oibre feidhmi&uacute; i dteanga ar leith ar &oacute;c&aacute;id&iacute; &aacute;irithe ach ba cheart go gcuirf&iacute; an t-ualach ar an bhfost&oacute;ir a chruth&uacute; go raibh s&eacute; riachtanach cosc a chur ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaolainne san ionad oibre.  Bheadh s&eacute; faoin gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga cinneadh a dh&eacute;anamh an raibh an caighde&aacute;n sin s&aacute;saithe agus an raibh g&aacute; sa ch&aacute;s ar leith sin go gcuireadh cosc ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaolainne.  Ar&iacute;s t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh cur le labhairt na Gaeilge sa t&iacute;r seo seachas cead a thabhairt do daoine cosc a chur uirthi.  Sin iad mo chuid molta&iacute;.
